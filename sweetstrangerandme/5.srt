00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,770
<font color="yellow">Still, he can't be the one.</font>

160
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,640
<font color="yellow">You need to report him to the police.</font>

161
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,100
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

162
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,070
<font color="yellow">If not, you'll only lose sleep and get wrinkles.</font>

163
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,300
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

164
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,340
<font color="yellow">I may lose this battle but shall win the war.</font>

165
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,970
<font color="yellow">I'm Hong Na Ri.</font>

166
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,170
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask him all sorts of questions.</font>

167
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,870
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure that he answers everything thoroughly.</font>

168
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,770
<font color="yellow">Fine. That was cool.</font>

169
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,570
<font color="yellow">My heart pounded.</font>

170
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,840
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep thinking about him?</font>

171
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,440
<font color="yellow">Get out of my head.</font>

172
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,100
<font color="yellow">(KWON DUK BONG)</font>

173
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,200
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Na Ri.</font>

174
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,500
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Didn't you forget something?</font>

175
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,700
<font color="yellow">I did?</font>

176
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,140
<font color="yellow">You were supposed to call me.</font>

177
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,670
<font color="yellow">You said you received something from court.</font>

178
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,300
<font color="yellow">So what was it?</font>

179
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,940
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing and just tell me.</font>

180
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,840
<font color="yellow">I should tell you in person.</font>

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,600
<font color="yellow">- In person?
- It's quite complicated.</font>

182
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,300
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing.</font>

183
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,970
<font color="yellow">- Where should we meet?
- Soon. Bye.</font>

184
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,540
<font color="yellow">So where are we meeting soon?</font>

185
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,870
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

186
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,500
<font color="yellow">Why does she always hang up first?
I was still talking.</font>

187
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,870
<font color="yellow">"I should tell you in person."</font>

188
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,940
<font color="yellow">I guess she wants to meet.</font>

189
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,000
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

190
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,840
<font color="yellow">Make some sounds when you are walking.</font>

191
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,200
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

192
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,670
<font color="yellow">Did you wait long? I'm sorry.</font>

193
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,000
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to meet me here?</font>

194
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,370
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

195
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,170
<font color="yellow">Did Na Ri pay you back the money she borrowed?</font>

196
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,640
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

197
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,470
<font color="yellow">Well, yes.</font>

198
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,470
<font color="yellow">It turns out she took out a private loan.</font>

199
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,740
<font color="yellow">Who told you that?</font>

200
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,870
<font color="yellow">A lot of debt collection notices were sent to work.</font>

201
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,210
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows about it.</font>

202
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,440
<font color="yellow">You must feel bad. I do too.</font>

203
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,500
<font color="yellow">If you feel really bad,</font>

204
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,300
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't talk about it so lightly like this.</font>

205
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,740
<font color="yellow">I mean I didn't want to talk about it.</font>

206
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,540
<font color="yellow">I just thought you should know.</font>

207
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,740
<font color="yellow">I tried to make reservation, but couldn't.</font>

208
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,210
<font color="yellow">- So what are you going to do now?
- Well...</font>

209
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,500
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo.</font>

210
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,870
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Dong Jin?</font>

211
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,710
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

212
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,040
<font color="yellow">Let's come back another time.</font>

213
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,870
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I mean...</font>

214
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,370
<font color="yellow">What is this look on your face? Did you know?</font>

215
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,400
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

216
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,100
<font color="yellow">Shi Eun. Forget about it. Let's just go.</font>

217
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,900
<font color="yellow">Why do we need to go?</font>

218
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,940
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

219
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,770
<font color="yellow">We come here often because of our group discounts.</font>

220
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,070
<font color="yellow">- It's a mere coincidence.
- A coincidence?</font>

221
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,400
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

222
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,640
<font color="yellow">How can you be so composed and cool about it?</font>

223
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,040
<font color="yellow">I would have thrown her off the plane.</font>

224
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,940
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

225
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,740
<font color="yellow">Talk? I have nothing to say to you.</font>

226
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,670
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

227
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,140
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.
What's making him so confident?</font>

228
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,800
<font color="yellow">You saw that, right?
Nine years don't just disappear.</font>

229
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,440
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about how long they dated.
It's nothing.</font>

230
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,270
<font color="yellow">Excluding the time he was in the military and abroad,</font>

231
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,970
<font color="yellow">their nine years are not that long.</font>

232
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

233
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,300
<font color="yellow">She's about to lose it.</font>

234
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,370
<font color="yellow">Not while I'm still alive!</font>

235
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,270
<font color="yellow">You don't need to hold my hand.</font>

236
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,440
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you came here often.
I'm sorry.</font>

237
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,240
<font color="yellow">Don't be sorry.
You are free to go wherever you want.</font>

238
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,340
<font color="yellow">But since you two have no clue or manners,</font>

239
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,140
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit embarrassed.</font>

240
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,210
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.</font>

241
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,400
<font color="yellow">But are you really in trouble financially?</font>

242
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,640
<font color="yellow">Did your uncle take out a private loan?</font>

243
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,070
<font color="yellow">Is that what Yeo Joo said?
Do you two talk about me?</font>

244
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,840
<font color="yellow">Who's the lender?</font>

245
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,370
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

246
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,470
<font color="yellow">Are you curious?
Or do you want to pay it off for me?</font>

247
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,140
<font color="yellow">They're both annoying.</font>

248
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,640
<font color="yellow">You can't handle loan sharks.</font>

249
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,400
<font color="yellow">Get the house from that con artist and sell it.</font>

250
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
<font color="yellow">Whom are you calling a con artist?</font>

251
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,670
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

252
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,840
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for him, I...</font>

253
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,210
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

254
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,640

<font color="yellow">Na Ri, I won't come here again.</font>

256
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,870
<font color="yellow">Do you feel like talking like that even now?</font>

257
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,370
<font color="yellow">I respect you.</font>

258
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,570
<font color="yellow">Your taste doesn't change.</font>

259
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,370
<font color="yellow">At least, you got her a different color from mine.</font>

302
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,600
<font color="yellow">Will the lake disappear?</font>

303
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,900

304

577
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,440
<font color="yellow">You knew about her father's debt.</font>

578
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,170
<font color="yellow">Na Ri said this land was collateral,</font>

<font color="yellow">but the documents don't say that.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why won't you sell?</font>

597
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,900

619
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,200
<font color="yellow">You tell him when you go out now?</font>

620
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,470
<font color="yellow">Stop by the office before you go to Seoul.</font>

621
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,200
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

622
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,570
<font color="yellow">It's very important.</font>

623
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

624
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,000
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell him about the debt?</font>

625
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,570
<font color="yellow">He's a lawyer, so I consulted him.</font>

626
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,770
<font color="yellow">Buy Korean beef tail bone and make some soup with it.</font>

627
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,340
<font color="yellow">What? A tail bone?</font>

628
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,370
<font color="yellow">My workers and I must gain energy before it gets cold.</font>

629
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,070
<font color="yellow">You'll have to boil it all day.</font>

630
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,570
<font color="yellow">Do we have a pot that big?</font>

631
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,800
<font color="yellow">You must cook it in the old pot with the old way.</font>

632
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,600
<font color="yellow">A tail bone isn't enough.</font>

633
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,800
<font color="yellow">I'll make enough beef bone soup.</font>

634
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,970
<font color="yellow">Enough for us to eat it during fall and winter.</font>

635
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,070
<font color="yellow">All through winter?</font>

636
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,570
<font color="yellow">When are you going to Seoul then?</font>

637
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,800
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

638
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,300
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

639
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,500
<font color="yellow">I'm about to exercise now.</font>

640
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,940
<font color="yellow">I need some exercise too.</font>

641
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,970
<font color="yellow">All I do is just breathing exercise.</font>

642
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,770
<font color="yellow">I need to watch my figure...</font>

643
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,540
<font color="yellow">What should we have for dinner?</font>

644
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,000
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo.</font>

645
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,940
<font color="yellow">I don't feel so great...</font>

646
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,700
<font color="yellow">after running into Na Ri last time.</font>

647
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,400
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like working either.</font>

648
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,500
<font color="yellow">Maybe I feel guilty now.</font>

649
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,970
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

650
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,700
<font color="yellow">You are a kind and warm person.</font>

651
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,070
<font color="yellow">You want to be alone, don't you?</font>

652
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,370
<font color="yellow">You don't want to see me...</font>

653
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,870
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

654
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,670
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

655
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,970
<font color="yellow">I need some time alone.</font>

656
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,170
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

657
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,570
<font color="yellow">I'll busy for a while, so that's good.</font>

658
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,070
<font color="yellow">Go into your own cave...</font>

659
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,770
<font color="yellow">and emerge victoriously.</font>

660
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

661
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,270
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

662
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,800
<font color="yellow">What's this? Hey, calm down.</font>

663
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,470
<font color="yellow">You have a date tonight.</font>

664
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,570
<font color="yellow">He can't see me because he feels guilty.</font>

665
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,870
<font color="yellow">He didn't feel guilty when he cheated.
Why now?</font>

666
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:56,140
<font color="yellow">What? You said he's a good and sweet guy.</font>

667
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,400
<font color="yellow">That kind of guy doesn't exist.</font>

668
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,070
<font color="yellow">He is a good guy if he feels guilty.</font>

669
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,440
<font color="yellow">That's your ideal type.</font>

670
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,140
<font color="yellow">No, that isn't feeling guilty.</font>

671
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,370
<font color="yellow">Now that I became his first,</font>

672
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,370
<font color="yellow">I've lost all appeal.</font>

673
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,640
<font color="yellow">Appeal always drops.</font>

674
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,940
<font color="yellow">Just win with your body.</font>

675
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,670
<font color="yellow">Run. Just run.</font>

676
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,040
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

677
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,900
<font color="yellow">Let's do it. Increase the speed!</font>

678
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

679
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,900
<font color="yellow">- Wait! It's too fast. Do something!
- Run! Run!</font>

680
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,900
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

681
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,600
<font color="yellow">Each persimmon contains a year.</font>

682
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,100
<font color="yellow">You're a real poet.</font>

683
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,740
<font color="yellow">Do you know Hong Dumplings?</font>

684
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,800
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's Jung Im's place.</font>

685
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm her daughter.</font>

686
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,770
<font color="yellow">I know. You insect.</font>

687
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,370
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

688
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,000
<font color="yellow">There's an insect...</font>

689
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,600
<font color="yellow">that stays calm...</font>

690
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,400
<font color="yellow">then suddenly stings.</font>

691
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,770
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

692
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,740
<font color="yellow">Jung Im said...</font>

693
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,100
<font color="yellow">her daughter was like that.</font>

694
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,400
<font color="yellow">She said that you sting all the time.</font>

695
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,070
<font color="yellow">I'm not like that.</font>

696
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,740
<font color="yellow">I'm very soft.</font>

697
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,970
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

698
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,540
<font color="yellow">what was my mom like?</font>

699
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,700
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil?</font>

700
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,370
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil from Hope Orphanage?</font>

701
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:23,900
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

702
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,600
<font color="yellow">He's running Hong Dumplings now.</font>

703
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,240
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil? He's a hard worker.</font>

704
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,000
<font color="yellow">He used to live in Hope Orphanage?</font>

705
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,670
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

706
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

707
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,800
<font color="yellow">Beef bone soup again?</font>

708
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,140
<font color="yellow">We're going to get so healthy.</font>

709
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,870
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

710
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,300
<font color="yellow">Where do you go every day?
Aren't you going to Seoul?</font>

711
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,740
<font color="yellow">You said I need to grow.</font>

712
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,740
<font color="yellow">Do you know flowers have meanings?</font>

713
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,070
<font color="yellow">Guess what eggplant flowers mean.</font>

714
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,070
<font color="yellow">Truth. I love its meaning.</font>

715
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,440
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest.</font>

716
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,340
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

717
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,740
<font color="yellow">I'll need to clean up the house before it gets cold.</font>

718
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,340
<font color="yellow">Why not fix up the entire house?</font>

719
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,640
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

720
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,340
<font color="yellow">Just forget all this and live comfortably in Seoul.</font>

721
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,040
<font color="yellow">So annoying.</font>

722
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,400
<font color="yellow">What is she up to now?</font>

723
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,170
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

724
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
<font color="yellow">I came...</font>

725
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,670
<font color="yellow">to see you.</font>

726
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,300
<font color="yellow">Me? What is it about?</font>

727
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,440
<font color="yellow">Do you have time after work?</font>

728
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,600
<font color="yellow">I'm busy and I have nothing to say.</font>

729
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,500
<font color="yellow">Many people said to ask you if I want...</font>

730
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,940
<font color="yellow">to find out about Hope Orphanage.</font>

731
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,370
<font color="yellow">I don't have time and have nothing to say.</font>

732
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,140
<font color="yellow">Why did you hate my mom so much?</font>

733
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,200
<font color="yellow">Why? Can't I?</font>

734
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,400
<font color="yellow">Must everyone like her?</font>

735
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,940
<font color="yellow">No, you can hate her.</font>

736
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,070
<font color="yellow">But it looked like you had a reason.</font>

737
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,240
<font color="yellow">I just didn't like her.</font>

738
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,400
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, you just dislike people.</font>

739
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:16,340
<font color="yellow">This is a work place. Please leave.</font>

740
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,270
<font color="yellow">You hate me too.</font>

741
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,370
<font color="yellow">I understand that she hates you,</font>

742
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,170
<font color="yellow">but my mom is really nice.</font>

743
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,270
<font color="yellow">What do you understand that she hates me?</font>

744
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,270
<font color="yellow">It's sort of difficult to say to your face.</font>

745
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,040
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Tell me.</font>

746
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:46,840
<font color="yellow">Let's just say you are kind of...</font>

747
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,470
<font color="yellow">unlikable.</font>

748
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,240
<font color="yellow">I guess you're getting old too.</font>

749
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,900
<font color="yellow">I'm unlikable?</font>

750
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,800
<font color="yellow">People call it being chic nowadays.</font>

751
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,470
<font color="yellow">I'm attractive in that way.</font>

752
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,240
<font color="yellow">I'll just ignore that.</font>

753
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,640
<font color="yellow">What's keeping you busy
that you can't answer my calls?</font>

754
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,300
<font color="yellow">I was meeting people. Why?</font>

755
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,870
<font color="yellow">I withdrew the marriage cancellation complaint.</font>

756
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

757
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,100
<font color="yellow">Marriage? Cancellation?</font>

758
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,740
<font color="yellow">Complaint? Withdraw?</font>

759
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,000
<font color="yellow">I think I know why he became your stepdad.</font>

760
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,940
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

761
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,900
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I should tell you.</font>

762
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,640
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

763
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,140
<font color="yellow">You and Nan Gil grew up here.</font>

764
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,670
<font color="yellow">You were friends from grade school.</font>

765
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,140
<font color="yellow">- I know.
- You do?</font>

766
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

767
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,070
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel anything?</font>

768
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,340
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

769
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,140
<font color="yellow">Okay. They say grade school reunions...</font>

770
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,470
<font color="yellow">are popular worldwide.</font>

771
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,340
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that is?</font>

772
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,140
<font color="yellow">It's because what you saw and felt as a child...</font>

773
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,540
<font color="yellow">is unforgettable.</font>

774
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,170
<font color="yellow">Let's say someone does something so shocking...</font>

775
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,400
<font color="yellow">that no one in the world can understand him.</font>

776
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,740
<font color="yellow">What do you think the reason is?</font>

777
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,340
<font color="yellow">Is his becoming my stepdad that shocking?</font>

778
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,240
<font color="yellow">He's so young,
but he registered his marriage.</font>

779

- Of course not.</font>

<font color="yellow">And he insists on bearing all the responsibilities...</font>

782

<font color="yellow">and lives like a monk, making dumplings.</font>

783
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,000
<font color="yellow">And he has to fight against Da Da Finance.</font>

784
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,470
<font color="yellow">They practically kill people for not paying back.</font>

785
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,300
<font color="yellow">Why do you think he's putting up with all that?</font>

786

<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

787
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
<font color="yellow">Come to the lake.</font>

790

they fool themselves.</font>

793

<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

794
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,270
<font color="yellow">you need a place where you can face the truth.</font>

795

<font color="yellow">You cannot tell a lie here.</font>

796
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,270
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,740
<font color="yellow">it'll be the most peaceful and the freest place.</font>

<font color="yellow">You know this spot too.</font>

800
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,670
<font color="yellow">Then you must also know you can't lie here.</font>

801
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,570
<font color="yellow">That's why I want to give you Mom's phone.</font>

802

<font color="yellow">I didn't get rid of it yet.</font>

803

not knowing she passed away.</font>

804
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,440

805
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,470
<font color="yellow">It's your mother's belonging after all.</font>

<font color="yellow">I heard Da Da Finance is dangerous.</font>

809

<font color="yellow">I don't know what promise you made with Mom,</font>

810
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,200
<font color="yellow">but she isn't here, so you don't have to do this.</font>

811
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,500
<font color="yellow">I promised Mom during the funeral...</font>

812
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,570
<font color="yellow">What promise?</font>

813
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,340
<font color="yellow">To protect this place.</font>

814
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
<font color="yellow">And what does here mean to her?</font>

815
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,200
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what you've been searching for?</font>

816
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,640
<font color="yellow">And yet, you nagged me for not going to Seoul.</font>

817
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,340
<font color="yellow">I didn't nag... Actually, I did.</font>

818
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,870
<font color="yellow">Since we can't lie here.</font>

819
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,400
<font color="yellow">Figure out yourself what this place means to Mom.</font>

820
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,340
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything?</font>

821
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,100
<font color="yellow">- My nickname.
- Nickname?</font>

822
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,100
<font color="yellow">My mom called me "Puppy" in front of me,</font>

823
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,270
<font color="yellow">but she told others I stung like an insect.</font>

824
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,540
<font color="yellow">I can't believe she talked behind my back.</font>

825
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,770
<font color="yellow">She called you as pig toenail to me.</font>

826
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,100
<font color="yellow">She thought you were sharp and scary.</font>

827
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,940
<font color="yellow">She badmouthed me everywhere.</font>

828
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,300
<font color="yellow">I should try to find out more about Mom.</font>

829
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,470
<font color="yellow">Then make me a promise too.</font>

830
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,270

836
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,070

837
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:29,640
<font color="yellow">Do you have a girlfriend?</font>
