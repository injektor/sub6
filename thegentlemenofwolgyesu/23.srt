130
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,540
<font color="yellow">I brought them to give to your mother.</font>

131
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,300
<font color="yellow">You could eat them yourself. Gifts make me feel uncomfortable.</font>

132
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,140
<font color="yellow">Don't say things like that. That hurts me a lot, you know.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes, Dong Sook.</font>

<font color="yellow">I don't want to, but thanks.</font>

136
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,600
<font color="yellow">It's heavy. I'll take it inside and greet your mother, as well.</font>

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,910
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

155
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,770
<font color="yellow">If you want to buy it, I'll give you a 20-percent discount.</font>

156
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,270

<font color="yellow">1,600 dollars?</font>

158
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,570
<font color="yellow">1,600?</font>

159
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,740
<font color="yellow">Let's do this.</font>

160
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,040
<font color="yellow">There's a building in Yeongdeungpo that I've been eyeing.</font>

161
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,100
<font color="yellow">Once I buy that building, I'll buy this for you.</font>

162
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,000
<font color="yellow">- Wait until then, Dong Sook. - You're so cheap.</font>

163
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,370
<font color="yellow">Bags don't cost a fortune. Why wait until you buy a building?</font>

164
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,140
<font color="yellow">I save up dimes and quarters to make a dollar.</font>

165
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,140
<font color="yellow">That's how hard I saved up to become a landlord.</font>

166
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
<font color="yellow">Not that story again.</font>

167
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,970
<font color="yellow">I'm going upstairs.</font>

168
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,340

169
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,600
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

170
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
<font color="yellow">Can you spare me some time this evening?</font>

171
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,970
<font color="yellow">- What for? - To show you my buildings.</font>

172
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,170
<font color="yellow">Once you see the buildings I own,</font>

173
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,070
<font color="yellow">you won't even want a truckload of those handbags.</font>

174
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,700
<font color="yellow">What's... What's that you're hugging?</font>

175
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,040
<font color="yellow">It's a handbag that Dong Sook wants.</font>

176
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,170
<font color="yellow">If you want to buy it,</font>

177
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,440
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a special 20-percent...</font>

178

179
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,870
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 40 percent off the retail price.</font>

180
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,600
<font color="yellow">Is this the handbag that Dong Sook wants?</font>

181
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,840
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

182
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,470
<font color="yellow">If you give this to her, you'll earn a load of brownie points.</font>

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,440
<font color="yellow">The day you give this to Dong Sook,</font>

184
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,970
<font color="yellow">Mr Park will be thrown out of the picture.</font>

185
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,940
<font color="yellow">- Keep it for me. - What?</font>

186
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,100
<font color="yellow">I'll buy it off you when I make a hit album.</font>

187
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,740
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have asked.</font>

188
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,840
<font color="yellow">Don't sell it to anyone else. I'll buy it off you.</font>

189
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,970
<font color="yellow">When will that be?</font>

190
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,170
<font color="yellow">What should I do with you?</font>

191
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,040
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

192
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

193
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,900

195
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,940
<font color="yellow">Someone I know manages one, and he's looking for a singer.</font>

196
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,640
<font color="yellow">You value your pride too much. You'd never sing at a cabaret.</font>

197
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,700
<font color="yellow">- Forget I asked. - I'll do it.</font>

198
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,170
<font color="yellow">I'll go anywhere that'll let me sing.</font>

199
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,400
<font color="yellow">How about I start tonight?</font>

200
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

201
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,770
<font color="yellow">He used to say he wanted to make suits until the day he died.</font>

202
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,240
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why he wants to retire.</font>

203
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
<font color="yellow">He worked hard his whole life.</font>

204
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,940
<font color="yellow">I think we should let him take a break.</font>

205
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,740
<font color="yellow">What? Do you have something to say?</font>

206
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,700
<font color="yellow">Not. It's nothing.</font>

207
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,700
<font color="yellow">He looks really angry. What should I do?</font>

208
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,440
<font color="yellow">Why did I ask such a stupid question?</font>

209
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,270
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, Yun Shil?</font>

210

<font color="yellow">I'm really, really sorry about earlier.</font>

211
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,740
<font color="yellow">I know how incredulous it sounded, but please forget about it.</font>

212
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,700
<font color="yellow">What if the text makes him angrier?</font>

213
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,140
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

214
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,440

231
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,440

402
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,700
<font color="yellow">He travelled the country...</font>

403
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,270
<font color="yellow">and made free suits for people who couldn't afford one.</font>

404
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,540

<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

408
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,170
<font color="yellow">I bought it at a department store yesterday.</font>

409

<font color="yellow">Could you buy this off me?</font>

412
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,540
<font color="yellow">I swear that I only used it for one day.</font>

413
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,340
<font color="yellow">I practically hugged it when I walked,</font>

414
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,140

416
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,140
<font color="yellow">Then I'll give you a 20-percent discount.</font>

417
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,440
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to bargain with me?</font>

418
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,740

419

421
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,270
<font color="yellow">It's not even my style.</font>

422
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,340
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy a bag you won't even use?</font>

423
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,870
<font color="yellow">I bought it out of spite after getting into a fight with Sam Do.</font>

424
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,800
<font color="yellow">I can't afford this, and it doesn't even suit me.</font>

425
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,540
<font color="yellow">I tried to live beyond my means, and I'm paying for it.</font>

426
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,870

427
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,170
<font color="yellow">That is unbelievable.</font>

428
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,170
<font color="yellow">How could he get such an operation without your consent?</font>

429
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,440
<font color="yellow">My point exactly.</font>

430
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,740
<font color="yellow">I got so angry that I saw red.</font>

431
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,070
<font color="yellow">But why doesn't he want to have children?</font>

432
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,640
<font color="yellow">He said it's because...</font>

433
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,770
<font color="yellow">I can't give up despite my age, and I get stressed over it.</font>

434
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,900
<font color="yellow">He said it's for my sake.</font>

435
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,300
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

436
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,470
<font color="yellow">Does he still miss Young Eun?</font>

437
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,970
<font color="yellow">Who's Young Eun?</font>

438
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,240
<font color="yellow">His first love.</font>

439
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,570
<font color="yellow">His what? He had a first love?</font>

440
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,870
<font color="yellow">Of course. Why wouldn't he, with his looks and build?</font>

441
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,940
<font color="yellow">He told me that I was his first love.</font>

442
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,340
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

443
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,640
<font color="yellow">He brought her to the tailor shop a few times a long time ago...</font>

444
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
<font color="yellow">and introduced her to Mr Lee and me.</font>

445
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,100
<font color="yellow">Who is that witch?</font>

446
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,770
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

447
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,470
<font color="yellow">So who is that witch?</font>

448
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,700
<font color="yellow">They grew up together in the same orphanage.</font>

449
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,070
<font color="yellow">She was pretty and nice.</font>

450
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,770
<font color="yellow">She used to smile a lot, too.</font>

451
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,770
<font color="yellow">Where is that witch now?</font>

452
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,900
<font color="yellow">Do you have to call her like that?</font>

453
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,870
<font color="yellow">Where is that woman now?</font>

454
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,170
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

455
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,500
<font color="yellow">I think I heard that she moved to Seattle after she got married.</font>

456
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,470
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

457
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,800
<font color="yellow">Should I not have brought it up?</font>

458
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,540
<font color="yellow">Well... It wasn't anything serious.</font>

459
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was just puppy love.</font>

460
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,340
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Sam Do...</font>

461
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,840
<font color="yellow">that I told you this, okay?</font>

462
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right. I'll buy this purse from you,</font>

463
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,000
<font color="yellow">so don't tell Sam Do.</font>

464
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,400
<font color="yellow">Just pretend that you didn't hear anything.</font>

465
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,940
<font color="yellow">How much do you want for the purse?</font>

466
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,470
<font color="yellow">- 2,000... - 2,000?</font>

467
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,600
<font color="yellow">2,300 dollars.</font>

468
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,170
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

469
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,040
<font color="yellow">People at the shop told me that you left a while ago.</font>

470
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,700
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

471
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,540
<font color="yellow">I had to take care of something. Have a seat.</font>

472
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,940
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

473
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,600
<font color="yellow">What are these rings for?</font>

474
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,540
<font color="yellow">I thought about it...</font>

475
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,640
<font color="yellow">and realised that I have never given you a ring.</font>

476
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
<font color="yellow">When we got married, I couldn't afford it.</font>

477
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,100
<font color="yellow">And since then, we've been preoccupied with running the shop...</font>

478
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,640
<font color="yellow">and raising our kids while trying to make ends meet.</font>

479
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,070
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

480
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,640
<font color="yellow">I appreciate everything you've done, and I'm sorry that it's so late.</font>

481
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,970
<font color="yellow">I got two rings for you...</font>

482
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,170
<font color="yellow">to make up for keeping you waiting for so long.</font>

483
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,240
<font color="yellow">Try them on.</font>

484
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! They fit perfectly.</font>

485
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,670
<font color="yellow">I've lived with you for long enough to know.</font>

486
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,300
<font color="yellow">It looks like your little deviation away from home...</font>

487
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,740
<font color="yellow">has matured you a lot.</font>

488
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,470
<font color="yellow">I can't even recognise my hand with these rings on.</font>

489
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,500
<font color="yellow">It looks like it belongs to a woman from a very wealthy family.</font>

490
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,900
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

491
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,570
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm happy.</font>

492
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,170
<font color="yellow">You've never given me a ring before.</font>

493
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I should've been more affectionate.</font>

494
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,700
<font color="yellow">How about you leave again?</font>

495
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

496
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,640
<font color="yellow">You gave me two rings this time. If you leave again,</font>

497
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,670
<font color="yellow">you might come back with a gold necklace.</font>

498
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,470
<font color="yellow">You silly.</font>

499
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,870
<font color="yellow">- Would you like a cup of tea? - No, thanks.</font>

500
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,570
<font color="yellow">I just came to get a glass of water.</font>

501
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,400
<font color="yellow">I was just kidding earlier.</font>

502
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,240
<font color="yellow">I just said it as a joke, but you took it so seriously.</font>

503
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,300
<font color="yellow">Your reaction got me all flustered.</font>

504
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,070
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry about it at all.</font>

505
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,840
<font color="yellow">Why is he being like that? Doesn't he know that I'm embarrassed?</font>

506
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,300
<font color="yellow">Can't he just pretend to believe that it was a joke?</font>

507
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,100
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is stressing me out.</font>

508
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,470
<font color="yellow">I mean, it's Italy's top suit brand.</font>

509
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,700
<font color="yellow">I'm making a suit for the head designer there.</font>

510
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,600
<font color="yellow">It's like teaching a fish how to swim.</font>

511
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,100
<font color="yellow">Don't think like that.</font>

512
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,170
<font color="yellow">You could have something Italian craftsmen don't have.</font>

513
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,670
<font color="yellow">No. I think I should ask Mr Lee to make this suit.</font>

514
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,800
<font color="yellow">What if I make a mistake and ruin our shop's name globally?</font>

515
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,000
<font color="yellow">Gianni fell in love with your suit at the competition.</font>

516
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,840
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much and just put your skills to use.</font>

517
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,170
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Yun Shil. - Yes, Master.</font>

518
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,940
<font color="yellow">I wrote down the fabrics and materials I need on this order form.</font>

519
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,010
<font color="yellow">Can you go to the fabric market and get them for me?</font>

520
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,940
<font color="yellow">It'll be a very expensive suit.</font>

521
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,800
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to feel the fabrics and check everything in person.</font>

522
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,840
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Dong Jin, you should go with her.</font>

523
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,470
<font color="yellow">Just take a taxi, Yun Shil.</font>

524
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,170
<font color="yellow">I have to take care of something urgently.</font>

525
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,670
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the market.</font>

526
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,940
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later.</font>

527
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,170
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

528
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,040
<font color="yellow">I know I said that I was joking earlier,</font>

529
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,670
<font color="yellow">but I actually wasn't.</font>

530
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,570
<font color="yellow">You've been so nice to me,</font>

531
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,570
<font color="yellow">so I got the wrong idea.</font>

532
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,640
<font color="yellow">People can get wrong ideas at times, you know.</font>

533
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,040
<font color="yellow">I apologised to you in person as well as via text.</font>

534
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,470
<font color="yellow">Do you have to make me feel embarrassed like this?</font>

535
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,700
<font color="yellow">I should've been...</font>

536
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,670
<font color="yellow">more thoughtful.</font>

537
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,570
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me? - I was just worried as a co-worker.</font>

538
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,640
<font color="yellow">That's why I treated you like that.</font>

539
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,600
<font color="yellow">I guess my acts of kindness made you get the wrong idea.</font>

540
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for giving you the wrong impression.</font>

541
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful from now on.</font>

542
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,300
<font color="yellow">You don't need to apologise.</font>

543
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,670
<font color="yellow">I talked nonsense to you like a fool.</font>

544
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

545
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did the right thing.</font>

546
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,170
<font color="yellow">I can't have her think that I'm leading her on.</font>

547
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

548
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,470
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

549
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,040
<font color="yellow">Why were you waiting for me?</font>

550
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,770
<font color="yellow">You keep crying at work...</font>

551
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,800
<font color="yellow">and skipping meals. I feel like it's my fault, so I got worried.</font>

552
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
<font color="yellow">I thought I made it clear.</font>

553
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,140
<font color="yellow">I may cling onto you again if you're nice to me.</font>

554
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,570
<font color="yellow">I'm going to erase all memories of that day.</font>

555
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,570
<font color="yellow">You should forget about it, too.</font>

556
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,510
<font color="yellow">How can I forget?</font>

557
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,800
<font color="yellow">It was my first kiss.</font>

558
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
<font color="yellow">First kiss?</font>

559
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,510
<font color="yellow">It wasn't your first kiss, was it?</font>

560
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,300
<font color="yellow">Of course...</font>

561
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
<font color="yellow">it wasn't.</font>

562
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,900
<font color="yellow">See? I knew it.</font>

563
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,800
<font color="yellow">Then how many girls have you kissed? Where am I on your list?</font>

564
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,640
<font color="yellow">That's such an inappropriate question.</font>

565
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,870
<font color="yellow">Second?</font>

566
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,300
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

567
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,010
<font color="yellow">Third?</font>

568
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,510
<font color="yellow">No? You can't count with the fingers of both hands?</font>

569
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,040
<font color="yellow">Enough.</font>

570
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,170
<font color="yellow">It's my loss. My poor lips.</font>

571
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,170
<font color="yellow">I better get going now.</font>

572
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,600
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?</font>

573
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,940
<font color="yellow">Take responsibility for what you've done, you jerk!</font>

574
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,470
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

575
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,970
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - I think I hurt my back.</font>

576
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,010
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I do?</font>

577
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,540
<font color="yellow">- I can't get up. - Really?</font>

578
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,140
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

579
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,440
<font color="yellow">Please be gentle.</font>

580
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,140
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

581
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,570
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Just a second. I'm in pain.</font>

582
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,040
<font color="yellow">We're here. Get off.</font>

583
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,470
<font color="yellow">I can't get up by myself. Help me get up.</font>

584
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

585
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,800
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

586
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,600
<font color="yellow">I can't get up.</font>

587
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,270
<font color="yellow">Why not? You were fine when you were walking out of the hospital.</font>

588
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,270
<font color="yellow">I was okay earlier because it was right after I got a shot,</font>

589
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,170
<font color="yellow">but it's hurting again now.</font>

590
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,170
<font color="yellow">What's that look? I fell because of you. How can you be so mean?</font>

591
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,770
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to be mean.</font>

592
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,840
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do, then?</font>

593
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,770
<font color="yellow">- Carry me. - I beg your pardon?</font>

594
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,770
<font color="yellow">Carry me to my room.</font>

595
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,070
<font color="yellow">Ms Min.</font>

596
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,240
<font color="yellow">I can't even get up. What am I supposed to do?</font>

597
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,740
<font color="yellow">Shall I stay in the car all night?</font>

598
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,970
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

599
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,940
<font color="yellow">Ms Min, what happened?</font>

600
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,240
<font color="yellow">Please open the door.</font>

601
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,340
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

602
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
<font color="yellow">Is it Hyo Won or Hyo Sang?</font>

603
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,870
<font color="yellow">It's Ms Min.</font>

604
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,040
<font color="yellow">But some guy is carrying her.</font>

605
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,740
<font color="yellow">A guy is carrying her? What do you mean?</font>

606
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

607
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,470
<font color="yellow">What happened to her?</font>

608
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,640
<font color="yellow">What did you do to Hyo Won?</font>

609
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,300
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang didn't do anything wrong.</font>

610
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,340
<font color="yellow">I accidentally fell in the parking lot.</font>

611
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,670
<font color="yellow">I fell on my behind and hurt my back a little.</font>

612
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,070
<font color="yellow">- What? - I took her to a hospital.</font>

613
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,170
<font color="yellow">The doctor said that it's not a serious injury.</font>

614
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,870
<font color="yellow">She just needs a few physiotherapy sessions, so please don't worry.</font>

615
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,540
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang. You haven't been to our place before, right?</font>

616
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,440
<font color="yellow">My room is upstairs.</font>

617
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,370
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

618
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

619
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,740
<font color="yellow">What is that girl thinking?</font>

620
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

621
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,400
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Are you all right, Madam?</font>

622
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,440
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone.</font>

623
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,940
<font color="yellow">Thanks. Am I too heavy?</font>

624
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,540
<font color="yellow">No, it was fine.</font>

625
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,970
<font color="yellow">You don't look fine at all.</font>

626
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,470
<font color="yellow">You're sweating so much. Gosh.</font>

627
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,240
<font color="yellow">Halt!</font>

628
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,100
<font color="yellow">You two.</font>

629
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,100
<font color="yellow">What were you just doing?</font>

630
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,100
<font color="yellow">We weren't doing anything. He just put me in bed.</font>

631
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,170
<font color="yellow">Thanks for today.</font>

632
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,570
<font color="yellow">I would've had to call the ambulance if you weren't there.</font>

633
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,740
<font color="yellow">Are you actually injured?</font>

634
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, I told you. Here, look.</font>

635
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,740
<font color="yellow">The doctor even gave me medication.</font>

636
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,970
<font color="yellow">Ouch, my back...</font>

637
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,170
<font color="yellow">I'm in pain.</font>

638
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,140
<font color="yellow">I should get going now.</font>

639
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,040
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Follow him.</font>

640
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,300
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

641
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,140
<font color="yellow">He took me to the hospital and carried me. You'll just let him go?</font>

642
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,700
<font color="yellow">It's dinnertime. You should offer him food.</font>

643
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,040
<font color="yellow">You want me to ask him to stay for food?</font>

644
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,770
<font color="yellow">You made galbitang this morning.</font>

645
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,400
<font color="yellow">Fix a meal with that along with some grilled fish.</font>

646
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,870
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

647
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,840
<font color="yellow">Go catch him before he leaves.</font>

648
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,300
<font color="yellow">Go on. Hurry up!</font>

649
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,670
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm going.</font>

650
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,170
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

651
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,140
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

652
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,570
<font color="yellow">- Help yourself. - It's okay. I'll just eat at home.</font>

653
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,300
<font color="yellow">If I let you go without feeding you, Hyo Won, that brat...</font>

654
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,940
<font color="yellow">I mean, my daughter will lose it.</font>

655
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,640
<font color="yellow">No, I mean,</font>

656
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,100
<font color="yellow">she will be very angry at me.</font>

657
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,300
<font color="yellow">Why are you chuckling?</font>

658
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,400
<font color="yellow">I think Ms Min takes after you.</font>

659
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,970
<font color="yellow">That's what people say.</font>

660
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,470
<font color="yellow">I used to be pretty like her when I was young.</font>

661
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,570
<font color="yellow">You're still beautiful.</font>

662
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,540
<font color="yellow">You know how to butter up the elders.</font>

663
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,940
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

664
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,170
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

665
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,170
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to eat? - Not now.</font>

666
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,800
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat with my son when he gets home later.</font>

667
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,400
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

668
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,300
<font color="yellow">Thank you. It looks delicious.</font>

669
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,540
<font color="yellow">To be honest, Hyo Won...</font>

670
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,170
<font color="yellow">is way too much for you to handle.</font>

671
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,540
<font color="yellow">Just being smart isn't enough to get married into a rich family.</font>

672
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,970
<font color="yellow">It's nothing to be proud of, so I don't like to talk about it openly,</font>

673
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,570
<font color="yellow">but people know about it anyway.</font>

674
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,170
<font color="yellow">My older daughter married a guy from a normal family...</font>

675
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,240
<font color="yellow">but ended up getting divorced.</font>

676
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,440
<font color="yellow">Love couldn't conquer the difference in status and class.</font>

677
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,340
<font color="yellow">So I suggest that you come to your senses...</font>

678
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,600
<font color="yellow">and give up on dating Hyo Won.</font>

679
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,740
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in Ms Min.</font>

680
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,300
<font color="yellow">You're not interested in my daughter? Why not?</font>

681
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,570
<font color="yellow">This may sound rude, but she's not my type.</font>

682
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,770
<font color="yellow">So you have nothing to worry about.</font>

683
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,070
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

684
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,340
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm relieved to hear that.</font>

685
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,240
<font color="yellow">But what's wrong with my daughter? Why is she not your type?</font>

686
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,840
<font color="yellow">From her looks to her academic background,</font>

687
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,540
<font color="yellow">she's certainly an amazing catch.</font>

688
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,340
<font color="yellow">She is,</font>

689
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,170
<font color="yellow">but what you're concerned about will not happen. Please don't worry.</font>

690
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,440
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

691
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,040
<font color="yellow">He can be quite manly.</font>

692
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,840
<font color="yellow">Shall I fix dinner for you?</font>

693
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,900
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

694
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,900
<font color="yellow">Try this, too.</font>

695
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,270
<font color="yellow">- Do we have a guest? - Yes.</font>

696
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,000
<font color="yellow">Some guy carried Hyo Won home.</font>

697
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,270
<font color="yellow">Someone carried her home? Who is the guy?</font>

698
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,670
<font color="yellow">He's having dinner with Madam Ko in the kitchen now.</font>

699
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,270
<font color="yellow">I see. You must like tteokgalbi.</font>

700
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,470
<font color="yellow">Did Hyo Won get a boyfriend?</font>

701
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,140
<font color="yellow">I think he was one of the models at the fashion show.</font>

702
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,640
<font color="yellow">Who's Young Eun?</font>

703
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,740
<font color="yellow">His first love.</font>

704
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,040
<font color="yellow">His what? He had a first love?</font>

705
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,440
<font color="yellow">He brought her to the tailor shop a few times a long time ago...</font>

706
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,270
<font color="yellow">and introduced her to Mr Lee and me.</font>

707
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,840
<font color="yellow">What a liar.</font>

708
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,340
<font color="yellow">He has been lying to me that I'm his first love.</font>

709
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,040
<font color="yellow">What is this smell? Are you going to burn all the chicken?</font>

710
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sorry. I was distracted.</font>

711
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting home so late? I'm starving.</font>

712
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,670
<font color="yellow">It's not like I was out playing.</font>

713
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,570
<font color="yellow">- What about dinner? - Just eat this.</font>

714
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,670
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

715
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,900
<font color="yellow">You can't even cook dinner for your husband who worked hard all day?</font>

716
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,170
<font color="yellow">How can you tell me to just eat fried chicken?</font>

717
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,240
<font color="yellow">I also worked hard all day.</font>

718
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,140
<font color="yellow">Fix dinner for yourself if you want something else.</font>

719
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,900
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be like this?</font>

720
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,540
<font color="yellow">It's up to me to decide whether I'm going to be like this or not.</font>

721
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so sick of this.</font>

722
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,370
<font color="yellow">Sure, you're sick of me.</font>

723
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,640
<font color="yellow">It's autumn now, so you must also miss your first love.</font>

724
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,970
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

725
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,600
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

726
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,170

<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

742
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,800
<font color="yellow">It looks like you agreed to guarantee someone's debt.</font>

743
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,300
<font color="yellow">This is... I think I agreed to be a guarantor when my friend, Yong Suk,</font>

744
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,100
<font color="yellow">from the orphanage was starting a business about 10 years ago.</font>

745
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,800
<font color="yellow">Just a second. Where's Yong Suk's number?</font>

746
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,770
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialled does not exist. Please check...</font>

747
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,840
<font color="yellow">The number does not exist. What is going on?</font>

748
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,300
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you?</font>

749
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,340
<font color="yellow">I told you that you should never guarantee anyone's debt.</font>

750
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,140
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second. This guy, Yong Suk,</font>

751
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,670
<font color="yellow">would never eat up my money and disappear. I'll try to find him.</font>

752
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,840
<font color="yellow">Come to your senses already.</font>

753
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,670

755

<font color="yellow">We lost our store,</font>

756
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,770
<font color="yellow">and we're going to lose all of our money now.</font>

<font color="yellow">Will we ever get to live like other people?</font>

759
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,070
<font color="yellow">I'll just pay it off.</font>

760

00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,700
<font color="yellow">We even got a notice of acceleration. If we can't pay it,</font>

762
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,500
<font color="yellow">there will be seizure tickets all over the place.</font>

763
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,670
<font color="yellow">You'll become a credit delinquent. What are you going to do?</font>

764
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,740
<font color="yellow">That's for me to worry about. Mind your own business.</font>

765
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,170
<font color="yellow">How can you say it like that?</font>

766
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,340
<font color="yellow">- Am I a stranger to you? - I wish you were.</font>

767
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,470
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - You're always like this.</font>

768
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,040
<font color="yellow">Nothing matters to you besides money and babies, right?</font>

769
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,370
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

770
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

771
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

772
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,940
<font color="yellow">Don't craw back in here before you get that money back.</font>

773
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,300
<font color="yellow">- Are you kicking me out right now? - Yes, I am.</font>

774
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,170
<font color="yellow">You should learn a lesson on the value of money.</font>

775
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,370
<font color="yellow">Don't come back until you have that 50,000 dollars.</font>

776
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,370
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

777
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,700
<font color="yellow">I won't come back even if you beg, so don't worry.</font>

778
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,500
<font color="yellow">You should run back to your first love, Young Eun.</font>

779
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,570
<font color="yellow">Young Eun?</font>

780
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,940
<font color="yellow">How do you know Young Eun?</font>

781
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,470
<font color="yellow">You horrible man.</font>

782
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,640
<font color="yellow">Get out of my face!</font>

783
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,670
<font color="yellow">What's going on out there?</font>

784
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,370
<font color="yellow">What's that suitcase for?</font>

785
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,270
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for making a fuss, Mr Lee and Ms Choi.</font>

786
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,670
<font color="yellow">Where is Sam Do going?</font>

787
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,370
<font color="yellow">I kicked him out.</font>

788
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,640
<font color="yellow">- You did what? - What?</font>

789
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,170
<font color="yellow">He guaranteed someone's debt without telling me again.</font>

790
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,270
<font color="yellow">We received a letter of demand from the bank.</font>

791
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,170
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'm sick of it.</font>

792
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,400
<font color="yellow">I'm done cleaning up after his mess.</font>

793
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,400
<font color="yellow">I can't do it any more.</font>

794
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,140
<font color="yellow">I've had enough.</font>

795
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,970
<font color="yellow">But still, how can you kick him out at this time of the night?</font>

796
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,170
<font color="yellow">He'll figure it out on his own. I'll go back upstairs.</font>

797
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,970
<font color="yellow">First it's you, and now it's Sam Do.</font>

798
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,070
<font color="yellow">What should we do about him?</font>

799
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,740
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

800
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:26,170
<font color="yellow">You said that I should leave you first</font>

801
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:33,370
<font color="yellow">You said you only wanted me to see your pretty moments</font>

802
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,740
<font color="yellow">You told me to leave you there</font>

803
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,300
<font color="yellow">- Susanna - Stop right there.</font>

804
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,540
<font color="yellow">- But this is the good part. - It's an opening ceremony.</font>

805
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,000
<font color="yellow">You'll scare off every customer if you sing such a sad song.</font>

806
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,470
<font color="yellow">We don't want you to sing a sad song.</font>

807
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,900
<font color="yellow">Can't you sing anything cheerful? A trot song, perhaps?</font>

808
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,940
<font color="yellow">Trot?</font>

809
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,870
<font color="yellow">But I'm a rock ballad singer.</font>

810
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:04,870
<font color="yellow">What? Who sings rock at a cabaret?</font>

811
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,170
<font color="yellow">- The song needs to be exciting. - Come on.</font>

812
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,570
<font color="yellow">- Sing us some trot songs. - What?</font>

813
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,670
<font color="yellow">I think you've got the wrong person.</font>

814
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,800
<font color="yellow">I don't sing trot songs. I'm a rocker.</font>

815
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,440
<font color="yellow">- A rocker. - Hey, come on.</font>

816
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,270
<font color="yellow">They really want to hear you sing.</font>

817
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,170
<font color="yellow">Come on and sing us a trot song.</font>

818
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,340
<font color="yellow">I'll pass. No matter how desperate I may be,</font>

819
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,740
<font color="yellow">I can't just throw away my rock spirit.</font>

820
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

821
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,370
<font color="yellow">Jun.</font>

822
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,300
<font color="yellow">- Jun. - Don't come out.</font>

823
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,870
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

824
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,440

826
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,640
<font color="yellow">going to eat at that diner again?</font>

827
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,540
<font color="yellow">I can't take you to the same place again.</font>

828
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,070
<font color="yellow">Today, I'll be giving you a tour around the two buildings...</font>

829
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,570
<font color="yellow">I own in Jongno.</font>

830
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:08,170
<font color="yellow">After that, we'll go to Gwangjang Market, and I'll buy you...</font>

831
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,470
<font color="yellow">bindaetteok and gimbap.</font>

832

<font color="yellow">Bindaetteok and gimbap?</font>

833
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,940
<font color="yellow">Are they not to your liking?</font>

834
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,400
<font color="yellow">They're quite popular at the market.</font>

835
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,470
<font color="yellow">Fine. I know a nice snack bar next to that place.</font>

836
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,470
<font color="yellow">Let's go there. They have more than 30 menus.</font>

837
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,400
<font color="yellow">I tried all of them, and jjolmyeon is the best.</font>

838
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,400
<font color="yellow">- If you order a large size, they... - Fine. Let's go.</font>

839
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,940
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Going somewhere, Dong Sook?</font>

840
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,240
<font color="yellow">You do know that I own two buildings in Jongno, right?</font>

841
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,400
<font color="yellow">I'll be showing her my buildings.</font>

842
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,700
<font color="yellow">After that, we'll have dinner together.</font>

843
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,500
<font color="yellow">- Shall we? - Let's go.</font>

844
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,940
<font color="yellow">What a nice car.</font>

845
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,570
<font color="yellow">A tour around buildings and a dinner date.</font>

846
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,370
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook is getting what she deserves.</font>

847
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:10,900
<font color="yellow">When will I ever get a car like that and give Dong Sook a ride?</font>

848
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,440
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - Yes?</font>

849
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,270
<font color="yellow">Can we turn on the heater?</font>

850
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,170
<font color="yellow">- Are you cold? - Yes.</font>

851
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,640
<font color="yellow">I've been coming down with a cold since the afternoon.</font>

852
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What are you doing?</font>

853
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,070
<font color="yellow">You're being gross.</font>

854
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,570
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

855
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,500
<font color="yellow">I was just making you warm since you said you're cold.</font>

856
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,000
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that? Just turn the heater on.</font>

857
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,470
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

858
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,400
<font color="yellow">We don't produce any oil in this country.</font>

859
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,300
<font color="yellow">You want me to turn the heater on and waste my gas away?</font>

860

<font color="yellow">I'm a building owner.</font>

861
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,340

862

<font color="yellow">You're ridiculous.</font>

864
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,440
<font color="yellow">Why bother driving a car, then? You could just walk.</font>

865
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,000
<font color="yellow">I love a woman who thinks like that.</font>

<font color="yellow">Do you know what kind of position you put me in?</font>

881
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,370
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

882
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,140
<font color="yellow">You told me that Mr Lee has a crush on me.</font>

883
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,600
<font color="yellow">- I did. - So I asked him in the morning...</font>

00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,800
<font color="yellow">and made a fool of myself.</font>

885
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,500
<font color="yellow">You asked him that directly?</font>

886

<font color="yellow">- Yes. - How could you do that?</font>

887
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,070

888
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,340
<font color="yellow">It wasn't like that. He got really upset.</font>

889
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,140
<font color="yellow">He looked at me like I was some crazy woman.</font>

890
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,600
<font color="yellow">That's not possible.</font>

891
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,270
<font color="yellow">Of course it is.</font>

892
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,370

893
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,240
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask him that, anyway?</font>

894
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,000

<font color="yellow">Well, I know it's not possible,</font>

898
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,400
<font color="yellow">but if he does actually like me,</font>

899
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,770
<font color="yellow">that would be terrible.</font>

900
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,400
<font color="yellow">How is that terrible?</font>

<font color="yellow">Stop saying things like that.</font>

907
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,140
<font color="yellow">You made things get awkward between me and him.</font>

908
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,400
<font color="yellow">He thinks I'm silly a woman.</font>

909
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,540
<font color="yellow">I guess she decided to go home right away.</font>

00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,300
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

911
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,470
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

912
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,070
<font color="yellow">I stopped by when I saw the lights on.</font>

913
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,640
<font color="yellow">You did? Take a seat.</font>

914
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,870
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some tea? - I just had some with Yun Shil.</font>

915
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,940
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil scolded me during the entire time.</font>

916
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,170
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

917
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,870
<font color="yellow">I told her something I shouldn't have.</font>

918
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:32,370
<font color="yellow">It's my fault, not hers. Please go easy on her.</font>

919
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,900
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

920
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,470
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I'm the one who told her that...</font>

921
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,140
<font color="yellow">you might have a crush on her.</font>

922
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,900
<font color="yellow">Why would you think that?</font>

923
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,500
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have a clear reason,</font>

924
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,240
<font color="yellow">but that's just what I thought based on my observations.</font>

925
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,700
<font color="yellow">Was I mistaken?</font>

926
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,740
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is a good person.</font>

927
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,170
<font color="yellow">It's true that I have good feelings for her.</font>

928
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,240
<font color="yellow">But I'm not sure if those feelings are what you said they could be.</font>

929
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,570
<font color="yellow">She's a good person.</font>

930
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:12,800
<font color="yellow">But I think it's more like a feeling of sympathy...</font>

931
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,670
<font color="yellow">for everything she's going through.</font>

932
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,800
<font color="yellow">That's not what it looked like to me.</font>

933
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,270
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I don't know what I'm feeling right now.</font>

934
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,640
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to ask myself that.</font>

935
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,470
<font color="yellow">So until I do find an answer, don't tell Yun Shil about it.</font>

936
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,940
<font color="yellow">Can you keep the promise?</font>

937
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:34,740
<font color="yellow">She already has enough worries. I don't want to bother her.</font>

938
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,000
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

939
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,840
<font color="yellow">Sam Do. What's all that?</font>

940
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,540
<font color="yellow">This? I got kicked out.</font>

941
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,870
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

942
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:50,140
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This needs ironing.</font>

943
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,170
<font color="yellow">I know how you must be feeling,</font>

944
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,840
<font color="yellow">but you can't kick out the man of the family.</font>

945
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,870
<font color="yellow">The two of you should join forces at times of hardship.</font>

946
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,870
<font color="yellow">This is the third time...</font>

947
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,770
<font color="yellow">he threw away money for guaranteeing someone's debt.</font>

948
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,040
<font color="yellow">It'd be easier to make a cow understand...</font>

949
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,140
<font color="yellow">than to get through to him.</font>

950
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,570
<font color="yellow">I understand why you're upset,</font>

951
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:16,500
<font color="yellow">but he might get really angry and never come back.</font>

952
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,540
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

953
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,240
<font color="yellow">I have to get some sleep. Please take Ms Choi and leave.</font>

954
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,040
<font color="yellow">He always gets used by other people.</font>

955
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,870
<font color="yellow">I have to teach him a lesson once and for all.</font>

956
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head.</font>

957
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:01,100
<font color="yellow">I was just worried as a co-worker. That's why I treated you like that.</font>

958
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,140
<font color="yellow">I guess my acts of kindness made you get the wrong idea.</font>

959
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for giving you the wrong impression.</font>

960
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful from now on.</font>

961
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,700
<font color="yellow">Why am I crying? Silly me.</font>

962
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,770
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Yun Shil?</font>

963
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,570
<font color="yellow">You didn't have breakfast yet, right?</font>

964
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,140
<font color="yellow">Mum made seaweed soup for your birthday today.</font>

965
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:00,270
<font color="yellow">You should come over before you go to work.</font>

966
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,240
<font color="yellow">Don't refuse.</font>

967
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:06,600
<font color="yellow">Mum made it just for you, so stop by for some, okay?</font>

968
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,500
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll see you later.</font>

969
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,170
<font color="yellow">Is it Yun Shil's birthday today?</font>

970
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:16,000
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mum made seaweed soup and breakfast for her.</font>

971
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,170
<font color="yellow">Mum didn't want to leave her all alone on her birthday.</font>

972
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,370
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

973
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,900
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

975
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,970
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi asked me to come and have some seaweed soup.</font>

976
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,100
<font color="yellow">I heard that it's your birthday today.</font>

977
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
<font color="yellow">Happy Birthday.</font>

978
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,440
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

979
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:09,640
<font color="yellow">People make mistakes and misunderstand from time to time.</font>

980
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,870
<font color="yellow">Have you never made mistakes...</font>

981
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,600
<font color="yellow">in your life?</font>

982
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,370
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

983
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,600
<font color="yellow">I know you're baffled and upset...</font>

984
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,170
<font color="yellow">because of what I said to you,</font>

985
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,600
<font color="yellow">but how can you change your attitude completely overnight?</font>

986
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,370
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt your pride that much...</font>

987

989
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,700

990
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,600
<font color="yellow">Why did you follow me to the temple?</font>

991
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,840
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring me medicine and porridge when I was sick?</font>

992
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,340
<font color="yellow">Why did you fix my sink?</font>

993
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,900
<font color="yellow">Why did you walk me home,</font>

994

<font color="yellow">worry about me and say nice things to me?</font>

995

<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

996
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:08,100
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to figure out why I did all those things.</font>

997
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:12,240
<font color="yellow">You can hurt people's feelings with unintended kindness.</font>

998
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,600
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

999
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,540
<font color="yellow">You're a well-educated and well-off man,</font>

1000
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,840
<font color="yellow">so I guess you took pity in me because I looked pathetic to you.</font>

1001
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,900
<font color="yellow">But you can't blame me for getting the wrong impression.</font>

1002

<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

1006
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:39,770
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved that someone like you doesn't have interest in me.</font>

1007
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,600
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried I was in case you actually did like me?</font>

1011

<font color="yellow">Why do you have to be worried?</font>

1012
