<font color="yellow"><i> [Episode 7]</i> <br> Then, instead of the past, I want to ask the Go Nan Gil standing in front of me now.</font>

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,940
<font color="yellow">How do you feel now?</font>

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,560
<font color="yellow">You've remembered me for a long time.</font>

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,920
<font color="yellow">Do you still... like me?</font>

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:36,370
<font color="yellow"><i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unexpected Lovers @ Viki</i></font>

6
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,110
<font color="yellow">I think this is too fast... No.</font>

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,340
<font color="yellow">These ideas about timing are a result of human's biases.</font>

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,880
<font color="yellow">Think about all the things we've been through together. He would be embarrassed to say he likes me.</font>

9
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,320
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,230
<font color="yellow">I just got something stuck on me.</font>

11
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,540
<font color="yellow">You did a face massage. I don't see anything else.</font>

12
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,870
<font color="yellow">Don't try to change the subject.</font>

13
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:19,170
<font color="yellow">You're right. I've remembered you a long time and I still like you.</font>

14
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,750
<font color="yellow">But, that's like a beautiful memory. Meeting in your hometown and liking someone?</font>

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,960
<font color="yellow">I don't know the Hong Na Ri that lives in Seoul.</font>

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,070
<font color="yellow">And I don't want to know her. I don't like her, miss her, or long for her. I think of her as a stranger.</font>

17
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,300
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? The me that is here and the me in Seoul... are different?</font>

18
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,870
<font color="yellow">You're different of course. The you that is here is my mom's daughters and the Hong Na Ri I've liked for a long time.</font>

19
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,360
<font color="yellow">But the Hong Na Ri in Seoul is someone I don't know at all.</font>

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,110
<font color="yellow">But, do you understand what you are talking about right now? I don't understand any of it.</font>

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,190
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in anyone who is not my mother's daughter.</font>

22
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,380
<font color="yellow">And, from now on, I hope you don't come here.</font>

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,330
<font color="yellow">I, and my employees, are all men, so it's uncomfortable.</font>

24
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,490
<font color="yellow">So, you're not interested at all? Think about all that you've done!</font>

25
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,710
<font color="yellow">You carried me and ran, came to look for me in Seoul, consoled me when I was hurt,</font>

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,280
<font color="yellow">took care of me when I was hurt, and even acted like my dad when you thought I would be in trouble.</font>

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,200
<font color="yellow">Playing with people emotions... and I'm the only one who was fooled?</font>

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,230
<font color="yellow">If it was just me... it's so embarrassing!</font>

29
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,750
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing to say, can you let go?</font>

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:32,500
<font color="yellow">I still have something to say. Because you are still confessing that you like the me that is here.</font>

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,450
<font color="yellow">- Confess? <br> - Yeah, you just confessed.</font>

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,330
<font color="yellow">So, now you just have to get to know the Hong Na Ri from Seoul. I'll call you often.</font>

33
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,600
<font color="yellow">And the others feel uncomfortable around me? I understand the beautiful meaning behind "uncomfortable".</font>

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,940
<font color="yellow">Being uncomfortable means you like me and care for me.</font>

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,080
<font color="yellow">- I don't think that's right.<br> - I'm right.</font>

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,650
<font color="yellow"><i> Go Nan Gil!</i></font>

37
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,430
<font color="yellow">Mr. Go Nan Gil. Are you home?</font>

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,460
<font color="yellow">Mr. Go Nan Gil. Are you home?</font>

39
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,170
<font color="yellow">What is going on here? Do you have a warrant?</font>

40
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,260
<font color="yellow"><i> Mr. Go Nan Gil. Please open the door.</i></font>

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,830
<font color="yellow">I'm his lawyer. They have a lot of issues, so I'm representing them.</font>

42
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,840
<font color="yellow">What is the problem here? You shouldn't just come barging in like that.</font>

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
<font color="yellow">- You're his lawyer? <br> - Yes.</font>

44
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,340
<font color="yellow">Where is Mr. Go Nan Gil?</font>

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,950
<font color="yellow">So, tell me what this is about.</font>

46
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,160
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Go Nan Gil? <br> - Don't answer him.</font>

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,540
<font color="yellow">Is this your lawyer</font>

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,300
<font color="yellow">Yes. He is our lawyer.</font>

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,780
<font color="yellow">Mr. Shin Jung Nam has reported that Mr. Go Nan Gil has threatened, used physical force, and kidnapped him.</font>

50
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,160
<font color="yellow">We have some things to investigate, so why don't you come down to the station with us.</font>

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,820
<font color="yellow">Shin Jung Nam is... my uncle.</font>

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,540
<font color="yellow">We've been looking for him. But who did you say threatened him?</font>

53
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,850
<font color="yellow">Go Nan Gil, it looks like you have a record.</font>

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,610
<font color="yellow">The allegations in the suit are pretty shabby. It doesn't event have the location of the incident or the details of any injury.</font>

55
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,760
<font color="yellow">On top of that, my client did not leave Seulgi-ri during this period of time.</font>

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,260
<font color="yellow">Can I meet with the suer, Shin Jung Nam?</font>

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,700
<font color="yellow">Bingo. That's right! Looks like you know a thing or two about the law.</font>

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,310
<font color="yellow">How about it? Can we have a meeting?</font>

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,790
<font color="yellow">If his side refuses the meeting, can we report the suer as missing?</font>

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

61
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,050
<font color="yellow">I've been in close contact with Shin Jung Nam, but recently, his phone has been turned off.</font>

62
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,520
<font color="yellow">So, I've been worried about him.</font>

63
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,120
<font color="yellow">Go Nan Gil's investigation has ended, and they reported Shin Jung Nam as missing.</font>

64
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,540
<font color="yellow">I predicted that already. There's no need for me to know all the small things.</font>

65
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,930
<font color="yellow">Go on to the next plan.</font>

66
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,950
<font color="yellow">They say that Go Nan Gil has a lawyer and he went to the police station with him.</font>

67
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,940
<font color="yellow">A lawyer?</font>

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,950
<font color="yellow">Find out about that lawyer.</font>

69
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,140
<font color="yellow">Find out how long he's been with Go Nan Gil and what their relationship is.</font>

70
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,120
<font color="yellow">Make sure you find out.</font>

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
<font color="yellow">Why would Uncle make such an unfounded claim like this?</font>

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Dada Finance put him up to it... in order to create a police record.</font>

73
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,270
<font color="yellow">Bingo. If you have a previous conviction and police record, you'll look like a criminal, and it'll be disadvantageous for you in court.</font>

74
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,980
<font color="yellow">In effect, they are preparing a trial for you.</font>

75
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,080
<font color="yellow">According to Dada Finance records, you were listed under a different name.</font>

76
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,060
<font color="yellow">A client should not have any secrets from his lawyer.</font>

77
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,390
<font color="yellow">What is your connection to Dada Finance?</font>

78
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,430
<font color="yellow">Dada Finance CEO was my adopted father.</font>

79
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,290
<font color="yellow">Adopted father?</font>

80
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,090
<font color="yellow">Adopted father in which those people say, "hyung nim, hyung nim?"</font>

81
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,800
<font color="yellow">No, when I was 16, I was adopted.</font>

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,520
<font color="yellow">- But not now? <br> - No, it was dissolved.</font>

83
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,930
<font color="yellow">What did they say? Did Uncle really report you? Is he still not answering the phone?</font>

84
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,800
<font color="yellow">Uncle sued me, and I reported him missing.</font>

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,480
<font color="yellow">You did well. But, that threat...</font>

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,540
<font color="yellow"><i> I told you not to come here any more! This is my last warning. </i></font>

87
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,900
<font color="yellow">If you do something like this again, I can't guarantee what will happen to you, even if you are Uncle.</font>

88
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,740
<font color="yellow">I'm somone who does what he says.</font>

89
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,430
<font color="yellow">That time, that phone call... you said, "I can't guarantee what will happen to you, even if you are Uncle."</font>

90
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,110
<font color="yellow">Even I think it sounds like a threat. Did he record it?</font>

91
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,980
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to tell those things to your lawyer?</font>

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,200
<font color="yellow">Everything. You have to tell everything to your lawyer.</font>

93
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,760
<font color="yellow">It was a call I made from my room. How did you hear it?</font>

94
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,830
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you! How did you hear it?</font>

95
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,860
<font color="yellow">Now, wait. Let's not get overly emotional. According to Hong Na Ri...</font>

96
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,980
<font color="yellow">I just listened. It was dark, so I just listed to the phone convversation.</font>

97
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,430
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, let's have a planning meeting. Just you and me.</font>

98
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,050
<font color="yellow">There are things that you need to know as well.</font>

99
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,480
<font color="yellow">Didn't you leave yet?</font>

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,880
<font color="yellow">- President, eat. <br> - Don't mess around with the ingredients.</font>

101
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,540
<font color="yellow">Director, those guys are dumpling lovers. No doubt about it.</font>

102
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:14,230
<font color="yellow">When you were being taken by the police, those two were just making dumplings.</font>

103
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,950
<font color="yellow">But, not me. I love humans.</font>

104
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,890
<font color="yellow">If there are things we need to know about each other, tell me.</font>

105
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,960
<font color="yellow">If I don't tell you, what are you going to do? Leave?</font>

106
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,230
<font color="yellow">This... You're abusing your power as Boss, right?</font>

107
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,420
<font color="yellow">C'mon. Let us in on what is going on.</font>

108
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, you dropped something.</font>

109
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,290
<font color="yellow"><i>Director Bae Byung Sik</i></font>

110
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:49,710
<font color="yellow">The fact that he grew up in an orphanage and was adopted to somone like this - they are all things he couldn't control.</font>

111
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:56,150
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm not trying to judge the president of Hong Dumplings, I'm just letting you know.</font>

112
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Nan Gil knows that we are talking about this right now.</font>

113
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,430
<font color="yellow">I'm assuming.</font>

114
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sure his ears are itching and his back feels prickly.</font>

115
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,600
<font color="yellow">No, he's not like that.</font>

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,800
<font color="yellow">Do I have to think about not backstabbing the President of Hong Dumplings?</font>

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,700
<font color="yellow">- When are you going Seoul? <br> - Soon.</font>

118
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,630
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to give you a ride?</font>

119
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,360
<font color="yellow">Did I say something too sweet all of a sudden?</font>

120
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,130
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying, do you want to go with me since I'll be going as well.</font>

121
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,020
<font color="yellow">You should include Go Nan Gil in the planning meetings. Don't do it with just the two of us.</font>

122
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,760
<font color="yellow">Look, no matter how you look at it, no one would believe you are daughter and stepfather.</font>

123
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,240
<font color="yellow">They'll rule the marriage registration papers void by saying that the marriage itself is a fake, then charge you with fraud and</font>

124
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,580
<font color="yellow">conclude that it's Hong Na Ri's inheritance as the daughter instead of you and take it all.</font>

125
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:57,790
<font color="yellow">Dada Finance can't ever beat us. Both the marriage registration and adoption dissolution documents are perfect. We're not forcing it either.</font>

126
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:04,880
<font color="yellow">Is that so? In order not to lose the case, you both have to do a really good job at pretending to be family.</font>

127
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,560
<font color="yellow">You'll have to have a perfect father-daughter relationship on paper that's not forced and leaves no room for suspicion.</font>

128
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,290
<font color="yellow">From what I know, attorney fees are really expensive. Will you be okay doing this for free every time?</font>

129
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,570
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

130
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,090
<font color="yellow">You're holding out saying that you're not going to sell the land, so I thought about why I'm doing this for free.</font>

131
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,020
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, would you date me?</font>

132
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

133
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,920
<font color="yellow">Not as neighborhood friends, but as a closer... boyfriend?</font>

134
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,040
<font color="yellow">Wait... Why are you saying that all of a sudden?</font>

135
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,190
<font color="yellow">It seems like this stepfather of yours finds it really burdensome for me to act as your attorney free of charge.</font>

136
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,970
<font color="yellow">I'm revealing that I actually have an ulterior motive.</font>

137
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:58,000
<font color="yellow">You're not suddenly saying that out of nowhere, I see.</font>

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,330
<font color="yellow">Na Ri had a really hard time after she sent her mother off.</font>

139
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,060
<font color="yellow">I don't think she's back to normal yet either.</font>

140
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,120
<font color="yellow">So I'm saying... start slowly, seriously,</font>

141
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,920
<font color="yellow">and carefully.</font>

142
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,560
<font color="yellow">The atmosphere's really weird since you suddenly started acting all serious, Hong Dumpling Boss.</font>

143
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,210
<font color="yellow">Well, are your family circumstances good? If they are, then I agree to it.</font>

144
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,350
<font color="yellow">Hey, Go Nan Gil!</font>

145
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,640
<font color="yellow">Did you not hear what Mr. Attorney said? We have to maintain our familial relationship.</font>

146
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,090
<font color="yellow">We're not in the type of relationship where you can just call my name like that.</font>

147
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,900
<font color="yellow">Duk Shim called me Octopus Legs. It's understandable that she'd misunderstand.</font>

148
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,830
<font color="yellow">Why did you suddenly say something like that?</font>

149
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,790
<font color="yellow">I forgot that you're having a hard time because you act so brave all the time.</font>

150
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,220
<font color="yellow">But I'm not saying this out of the blue. When I talk with you, it's interesting and funny.</font>

151
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,250
<font color="yellow">Also, when you scolded my younger sister, you were wise, smart, and pretty.</font>

152
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,680
<font color="yellow">You shone brightly.</font>

153
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,250
<font color="yellow">That's why I want to date you.</font>

154
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,140
<font color="yellow">Did I speak too sweetly?</font>

155
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,810
<font color="yellow">Either way, let's get closer than we are now.</font>

156
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:25,730
<font color="yellow">I'll have to write this down in my diary. I'm wise, smart, pretty, and shone brightly.</font>

157
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,380
<font color="yellow">That's the best compliment I've heard recently. Thank you.</font>

158
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,620
<font color="yellow">But I still don't have any intentions to date anyone yet.</font>

159
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,690
<font color="yellow">Then think about how it would be if you dated a man named Kwon Duk Bong.</font>

160
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,610
<font color="yellow">I still can't do that yet.</font>

161
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,220
<font color="yellow">You could just say, "I'll think about it." Why do you have to say you won't even think about it once?</font>

162
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,450
<font color="yellow">To the person who gave you the best compliment you've heard recently.</font>

163
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,000
<font color="yellow">My head is full of other stuff. If I tell you "I'll think about it" you will wait for the answer, right?</font>

164
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:03,140
<font color="yellow">I won't tell you to give me an answer, so if you have some time left over, then think about it then.</font>

165
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,080
<font color="yellow"><i>Personal Information</i></font>

166
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,520
<font color="yellow">I've met a lot of people in three years. I've done my part as a member very well, right?</font>

167
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,430
<font color="yellow">Before you leave, I'll set up a matchmaking date with one of my hoobaes.</font>

168
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,600
<font color="yellow">Then I'd be so thankful!</font>

169
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,770
<font color="yellow">I put down his membership title and profile.</font>

170
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,500
<font color="yellow">But there's something that you should know.</font>

171
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,910
<font color="yellow">Take a deep inhale...</font>

172
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,630
<font color="yellow">The person that you said you're dating before</font>

173
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,590
<font color="yellow">is this man, isn't it? The captain of HTC Investments, Jo Dong Jin.</font>

174
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,810
<font color="yellow">He registered for a VIP account a few days ago.</font>

175
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,240
<font color="yellow">His first condition was the woman's household: money.</font>

176
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,900
<font color="yellow">His mother could have registered him because she doesn't know about me yet.</font>

177
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,960
<font color="yellow">Ah, that's right. That's right! There are a lot of cases like that, aren't there?</font>

178
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,880
<font color="yellow">I'll have to ask Oppa.</font>

179
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,780
<font color="yellow">Send me a picture of your hoobae.</font>

180
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,850
<font color="yellow">You were my best member. It's such a shame.</font>

181
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,140
<font color="yellow">- I'll get in touch with you.<br>- Okay.</font>

182
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,470
<font color="yellow">Hello, Grandmother. I got into a bicycle accident on my way there before,</font>

183
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,170
<font color="yellow">so I'm planning on going now.</font>

184
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,670
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

185
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,070
<font color="yellow">He agrees as long as that family circumstances are good?</font>

186
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,470
<font color="yellow"><i>Come to the lake!</i></font>

187
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,080
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

188
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,910
<font color="yellow">If you heard me talking on the phone that day, then you saw me getting undressed too, right?</font>

189
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,740
<font color="yellow">Wait. If someone heard this, they'd misunderstand.</font>

190
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,640
<font color="yellow">After seeing that and hearing why I threatened Uncle,</font>

191
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,260
<font color="yellow">why do you still trust me?</font>

192
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,500
<font color="yellow">Are you arguing about why I trust you right now?</font>

193
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,120
<font color="yellow">You're actually scared of what I did to become a legend.</font>

194
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,360
<font color="yellow">But why did you ask me if you're my first love and if I still like you?</font>

195
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,580
<font color="yellow">What do you want to say?</font>

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,300
<font color="yellow">Living together under the same roof and pretending to be family doesn't suit us. We've lived such different lives.</font>

197
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,410
<font color="yellow">I like it the way it was. All I have to do is solve this problem.</font>

198
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,180
<font color="yellow">So, until then, forget this place and me and just live your life.</font>

199
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,230
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do once you take care of everything, Go Nan Gil?</font>

200
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,760
<font color="yellow">Since it's Mother's land, I'll give it to you and leave if you ask me to.</font>

201
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,180
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if I sell the land around the lake and the forest as soon as it becomes mine?</font>

202
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,700
<font color="yellow">I believe that you won't.</font>

203
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:21,160
<font color="yellow">Don't believe in me. If protecting the land is your goal, then don't ever leave and keep protecting it.</font>

204
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,430
<font color="yellow">It's possible that our we lived really different lives and don't suit each other.</font>

205
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,380
<font color="yellow">But I'll choose whether I trust you or not.</font>

206
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,170
<font color="yellow">Do what you want then. But leave this place.</font>

207
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,380
<font color="yellow">Is that the reason that you've been pushing me away with all your might?</font>

208
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,720
<font color="yellow">Because we've lived too differently and don't suit each other?</font>

209
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I liked it here?</font>

210
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,410
<font color="yellow">I like it so much that I didn't want to go back to Seoul.</font>

211
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,510
<font color="yellow">I felt like you were a gift to mom and I am thankful for what you are doing for my father that I don't even remember.</font>

212
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,380
<font color="yellow">But why do you want me to forget about it and not come every time something happens? What are you so scared of when we haven't even started yet?</font>

213
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,180
<font color="yellow">Start what? Why are you so unafraid?</font>

214
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,040
<font color="yellow">You don't even know how I've lived up to this point or who I am!</font>

215
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,410
<font color="yellow">I made a promise with your mother.</font>

216
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,520
<font color="yellow">My feelings for you ended then.</font>

217
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,290
<font color="yellow">That's a promise that you made on your own. Don't fulfill that promise you made with Mom.</font>

218
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:21,050
<font color="yellow">The Mom that I knew wouldn't have decided that we're too different and don't suit each other.</font>

219
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,560
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

220
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,370
<font color="yellow">You know?</font>

221
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:30,690
<font color="yellow">But... if Mom were alive, I would have never shown up in front of you.</font>

222
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,760
<font color="yellow">Like I had done my whole life ever since I was younger.</font>

223
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,580
<font color="yellow">And it's not because Mom would have opposed it.</font>

224
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,360
<font color="yellow">It's me that won't do it.</font>

225
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,920
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> My foolish love </i> ♬</font>

226
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:54,320
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> But love still lives on </i> ♬</font>

227
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,840
<font color="yellow">Ah, I told you not to open my door suddenly! It's so annoying!</font>

228
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,820
<font color="yellow">Come out. Father is arriving soon.</font>

229
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,810
<font color="yellow">Tell him that I'm not here.</font>

230
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,640
<font color="yellow">He came to pick you up. Pack your stuff.</font>

231
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,760
<font color="yellow">There won't be any reason for you and I to see each other from now on, but I'm going to turn this room into a storage room as soon as you leave.</font>

232
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,120
<font color="yellow">Let's negotiate!</font>

233
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,820
<font color="yellow">What is there for me to gain from you at this time that I would negotiate with you?</font>

234
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,630
<font color="yellow">I will write an apology to that woman.</font>

235
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,020
<font color="yellow">That's you and Na Ri's problem.</font>

236
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,560
<font color="yellow">I'll get close to her and spill everything about her to you.</font>

237
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,110
<font color="yellow">Spill? Your use of vocabulary is seriously pitiful.</font>

238
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,220
<font color="yellow">Okay on the negotiation. What is that you want?</font>

239
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,710
<font color="yellow">Make it where I don't have to go to Seoul.</font>

240
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,850
<font color="yellow">That's impossible. End of negotiation.</font>

241
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,640
<font color="yellow">I'll make it where it's not impossible.</font>

242
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,930
<font color="yellow">So don't touch this room.</font>

243
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,110
<font color="yellow">Change your clothes and come out.</font>

244
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,930
<font color="yellow">Why does he always come without notice, like a secret Royal Inspector.</font>

245
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,230
<font color="yellow">You didn't purposely not tell me, right?</font>

246
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,810
<font color="yellow">What would there be for me to gain from doing that?</font>

247
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,090
<font color="yellow">You're so disconcerting.</font>

248
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,650
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

249
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,810
<font color="yellow">You don't even have that many employees. No need for you to all come and stand here.</font>

250
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,040
<font color="yellow">That's why we are all here.</font>

251
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,270
<font color="yellow">You've been doing well, right? You don't come to Seoul at all these days.</font>

252
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="yellow">Because I'm busy.</font>

253
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,740
<font color="yellow">Have you been doing okay?</font>

254
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,820
<font color="yellow">Omo, omo. Omo, our Chairman. Chairman!</font>

255
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,750
<font color="yellow">You must have forgot how my youngest daughter looks.</font>

256
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,600
<font color="yellow">Am I about to die or something? She's not greeting her own father first.</font>

257
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,620
<font color="yellow">Chairman! Have you been healthy all this time?</font>

258
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,200
<font color="yellow">Your dumplings are still pretty.</font>

259
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sick and tired of them now. I'm doing it so that guy can learn.</font>

260
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,190
<font color="yellow">But he doesn't learn a thing. He's always playing.</font>

261
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,220
<font color="yellow">You said that you've been at our shop since I was born, right?</font>

262
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,050
<font color="yellow">Back then, the shop was around this big.</font>

263
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,320
<font color="yellow">All the kids that were around when you were born have gotten married,</font>

264
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,300
<font color="yellow">but he still plays around even now.</font>

265
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,590
<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

266
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,600
<font color="yellow">Children are beings that exist to worry their parents.</font>

267
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,840
<font color="yellow">You and your dad also worried your mom quite a bit.</font>

268
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,620
<font color="yellow">Back then, Jung Im seemed like she would just curl up and die.</font>

269
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,020
<font color="yellow">Mom did? Because of me and Dad?</font>

270
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,790
<font color="yellow">Your father left and took you with him and didn't come back until a few months later.</font>

271
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,920
<font color="yellow">Your father just played around his whole life just like that guy.</font>

272
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,660
<font color="yellow">Where did Father and I go?</font>

273
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,590
<font color="yellow">No idea. You were probably traveling all corners of the country in luxury.</font>

274
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,890
<font color="yellow">He probably came back because he ran out of money.</font>

275
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:12,040
<font color="yellow">After that, Jung Im and your father's relationship fell apart.</font>

276
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,490
<font color="yellow">- Here. Try some of our dumplings.<br>- Oh, okay.</font>

277
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,360
<font color="yellow">She can't even speak informally now.</font>

278
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,100
<font color="yellow">I went to hang out at Hong Dumplings a lot.</font>

279
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,440
<font color="yellow">You played around then too.</font>

280
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,810
<font color="yellow">Make sure you tell that guy Nan Gil thanks for me.</font>

281
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,020
<font color="yellow">After he changed out the steamer for us, it's gotten so much more convenient.</font>

282
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:42,150
<font color="yellow">- You know Go Nan Gil, too?<br>- Nan Gil? Of course, we do.</font>

283
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,890
<font color="yellow">- Thank you! Goodbye!<br>- Goodbye.</font>

284
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,230
<font color="yellow">You're here?</font>

285
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,300
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Seoul tomorrow. I'm sorry if I've made you uncomfortable all this time.</font>

286
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,670
<font color="yellow">Why? What would be uncomfortable? Come anytime.</font>

287
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,810
<font color="yellow">Go and change into your best clothes.</font>

288
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,130
<font color="yellow">Don't you see that I'm working?</font>

289
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,220
<font color="yellow">I met up the grandma who used to work here.</font>

290
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,310
<font color="yellow">If you knew about that place, you should have told me about it beforehand. Why did you make me work so hard to find it?</font>

291
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,520
<font color="yellow">You said that you'd work on your own.</font>

292
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,670
<font color="yellow">That's right. I work well even when I'm alone.</font>

293
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,460
<font color="yellow">That's why there's somewhere we need to go together.</font>

294
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,890
<font color="yellow">It's a place that requires one to show respect. I'll be back after changing my clothes.</font>

295
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,060
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you.</font>

296
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,900
<font color="yellow">You go ahead first.</font>

297
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,430
<font color="yellow">What have you been doing</font>

298
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,910
<font color="yellow">that you still haven't taken care of the land issue?</font>

299
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,410
<font color="yellow">That's why your older brothers laugh at you.</font>

300
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,800
<font color="yellow">People always act like they'll do this and that for you.</font>

301
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:06,350
<font color="yellow">You should arrange for a dozen of different house plans and show them around.</font>

302
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,770
<font color="yellow">Stop wasting time, and build it quickly.</font>

303
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,240
<font color="yellow">This is exactly why we're called the worst resort company.</font>

304
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,060
<font color="yellow">Resort Company?</font>

305
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,750
<font color="yellow">How hilarious.</font>

306
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,340
<font color="yellow">In the olden days we would have called this a hostel operation.</font>

307
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,280
<font color="yellow">Don't drag it out and take care of it within the month.</font>

308
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,360
<font color="yellow">I don't expect you to take this year's college entrance exam, so graduate in Seoul.</font>

309
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,890
<font color="yellow">I've arranged a private school for entrance exam for you.</font>

310
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to college.</font>

311
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,170
<font color="yellow">There's no need for you to even pack your things.</font>

312
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,590
<font color="yellow">All I have to is drag you out by the ends of your hair.</font>

313
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,990
<font color="yellow">Are you going to make me go this far?</font>

314
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:05,470
<font color="yellow">Reconsider it carefully. It would be better for me to keep living here quietly for you.</font>

315
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,770
<font color="yellow">If I go Seoul, I'm going to cause a huge fuss. I'll cause accidents every day.</font>

316
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,740
<font color="yellow">I could even become a juvenile delinquent and get put in detention.</font>

317
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,820
<font color="yellow">Just raise the kid well.</font>

318
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,390
<font color="yellow">Time is money. We should leave now.</font>

319
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,250
<font color="yellow">Duk Shim said that she'll go next time. It seems that she studies well here because it's quiet.</font>

320
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,530
<font color="yellow">Take care of her well. She's your younger sister.</font>

321
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,290
<font color="yellow">- What are you looking at?<br>- Be quiet.</font>

322
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Unexpected Lovers @ Viki</i></font>

323
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,650
<font color="yellow">You look a little uncomfortable. Go back and change.</font>

324
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,310
<font color="yellow">- Where are we going?<br>- It's not somewhere you have to dress up for so much.</font>

325
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,110
<font color="yellow">- Alright.<br>- No.<br>- This isn't it?<br>- Nope.</font>

326
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,550
<font color="yellow">Alright. Ah!</font>

327
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,310
<font color="yellow">You're not going to work?</font>

328
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,910
<font color="yellow">- You look good. Pass!<br>- Alright.</font>

329
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,490
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

330
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,860
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

331
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,570
<font color="yellow">The Hong Dumpling man told me to tell you that he was thankful because the steamer is very convenient.</font>

332
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:47,900
<font color="yellow">- So where are we going?<br>- Oh, it's coming. It's coming!</font>

333
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,490
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you for the last time. I'll get off if you don't answer. Where are we going?</font>

334
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,120
<font color="yellow">Let's go on a date from now until midnight.</font>

335
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,520
<font color="yellow">A planned-out Cinderalla date that ends when the clock strikes twelves and everything goes back to it's original place.</font>

336
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,750
<font color="yellow">What are you saying all of a sudden?</font>

337
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,940
<font color="yellow">The main characters in today's movies and novels all go on a trip for several hours.</font>

338
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,760
<font color="yellow">Let's follow the trend too!</font>

339
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,750
<font color="yellow">You said that you ended your feelings. I'm turning that time back a little bit.</font>

340
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,920
<font color="yellow">Until the clock strikes twelve, we are lovers who just started dating.</font>

341
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,880
<font color="yellow">We grew up in the same neighborhood, so you know my mom and the neighborhood streets well.</font>

342
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,610
<font color="yellow">We know each other's nicknames, played perfect pranks on each other, and you stuck gum on my shoe-</font>

343
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,910
<font color="yellow">- I told you that wasn't me!<br>- You gave your umbrella to me on a rainy day,</font>

344
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:47,180
<font color="yellow">while you yourself get soaking wet. We have a relationship full of pretty memories.</font>

345
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,880
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> You and I, just the two of us</i> ♬</font>

346
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,650
<font color="yellow">And we became adults apart from each other. Then we met again at our hometown.</font>

347
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:59,780
<font color="yellow">We still really like each other even after we met again. So today, we decided to have our first date.</font>

348
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,570
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> You still don't know </i> ♬</font>

349
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,450
<font color="yellow">You got it? You understand, right? We're starting!</font>

350
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,970
<font color="yellow">- What did your grandma say? <br>- I told you I would tell you at home after the 12 o'clock bell tolls.</font>

351
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,150
<font color="yellow">Start!</font>

352
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:18,640
<font color="yellow">Go Nan Gil, I heard that you're the boss of a dumpling shop. Your shop is really nice.</font>

353
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,030
<font color="yellow">You know all of that. What the heck are you doing?</font>

354
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,960
<font color="yellow">You ask things like this when you first start dating!</font>

355
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,010
<font color="yellow">Your dumpling shop is bigger than I thought it would be. Do you have any plans on making it a franchise?</font>

356
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,390
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your voice?</font>

357
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,750
<font color="yellow">- Just cooperate with me!<br>- I can't do that because of my personality!</font>

358
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,120
<font color="yellow">What was your dream when you were younger?</font>

359
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,290
<font color="yellow">- I don't remember!<br>- I remember, I remember it.</font>

360
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:45,430
<font color="yellow">Your dream was to marry Hong Na Ri when you became an adult.</font>

361
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,990
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

362
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,640
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> Slowly, bit by bit </i> ♬</font>

363
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,800
<font color="yellow"><i>My kid and Nan Gil were the same age, so I played with him a lot when he was a baby.</i></font>

364
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:01,430
<font color="yellow"><i>You played with children so well. You play with anyone regardless of age.</i></font>

365
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:06,510
<font color="yellow"><i>Aigoo, that rascal Nan Gil said that he would fight the kids that bullied you.</i></font>

366
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,240
<font color="yellow"><i>So I taught him how to do that exactly right.</i></font>

367
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,400
<font color="yellow"><i>He gave his umbrella to you and got drenched in the rain.</i></font>

368
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I told to draw what his dream was,</i></font>

369
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,770
<font color="yellow"><i>and he drew that it was to get married to Hong Na Ri.</i></font>

370
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,500
<font color="yellow"><i>So I told him to redraw it as the boss of the dumpling restaurant.</i></font>

371
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,830
<font color="yellow"><i>But then his dream really came true. Aigoo,</i></font>

372
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,130
<font color="yellow"><i>If I had known it would turn out like this, I would have told him to draw that he wanted to be president.</i></font>

373
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,940
<font color="yellow">So let's go back to that time.</font>

374
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,650
<font color="yellow">Let's go back to that time that you dreamed of.</font>

375
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,890
<font color="yellow">I was young then, and I thought that was the only way that I could become Mom's family.</font>

376
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,390
<font color="yellow">- There was no other meaning?<br>- You don't have to explain yourself. They said you didn't draw it just once or twice.</font>

377
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,490
<font color="yellow">Give me your bag.</font>

378
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,650
<font color="yellow">Why my bag?</font>

379
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,400
<font color="yellow">When you are one a date, isn't the man supposed to hold the bag or something?</font>

380
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,900
<font color="yellow">Mr. Go Nan Gil, this is perfect according to the dating code.</font>

381
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,150
<font color="yellow">Next time, when I'm holding something heavy, you can hold it for me.</font>

382
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,000
<font color="yellow">Even though you are already carrying a big burden for me.</font>

383
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,820
<font color="yellow">It's not a burden.</font>

384
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,290
<font color="yellow">Did you wait long?</font>

385
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,450
<font color="yellow">Of all the men I've met until now,</font>

386
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,440
<font color="yellow">you rank #1 in arriving late to every date.</font>

387
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,150
<font color="yellow">You said you never had a boyfriend.</font>

388
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,730
<font color="yellow">How many have to had?</font>

389
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,650
<font color="yellow">Man #1 was rich, but too obsessive.</font>

390
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,330
<font color="yellow">Man #2 was rich, but violent.</font>

391
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,850
<font color="yellow">Man #3 was rich, but</font>

392
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,210
<font color="yellow">he lied every time he opened his mouth.</font>

393
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,010
<font color="yellow">And beyond that, I can't even recall.</font>

394
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:20,200
<font color="yellow">I will remember you as the man who was always late.</font>

395
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,730
<font color="yellow">What, did something happen?</font>

396
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,060
<font color="yellow">You can't be grumpy today.</font>

397
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,200
<font color="yellow">Why? I can't even express my own feelings?</font>

398
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,210
<font color="yellow">I wanted to formally introduce you to all my friends today.</font>

399
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,830
<font color="yellow">Should we do it another time?</font>

400
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,320
<font color="yellow">Uh... no. Let's meet them.</font>

401
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,650
<font color="yellow">It turned out nicely.</font>

402
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,280
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a really awesome place?</font>

403
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,690
<font color="yellow">When we were young, in our neighborhood,</font>

404
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,670
<font color="yellow">there wasn't a place like this.</font>

405
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,850
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever you want,</font>

406
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,100
<font color="yellow">so can you just go back to your normal voice?</font>

407
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,390
<font color="yellow">You said you would do anything.</font>

408
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,450
<font color="yellow">You're going to eat, drink, and go to karaoke, right?</font>

409
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,200
<font color="yellow">What kind of a date is like a 3-course meal?</font>

410
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,410
<font color="yellow">There aren't many thing we can do before midnight. There's a reason for everything.</font>

411
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,640
<font color="yellow">We get closer while eating, hold hands while drinking,</font>

412
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,080
<font color="yellow">and at karaoke, during the last song, we will kis...</font>

413
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,290
<font color="yellow">My friends have really varied characters.</font>

414
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,700
<font color="yellow">One is a bit slow, the other one is a bit off centre.</font>

415
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,330
<font color="yellow">They're a little mischievous, but they don't hold grudges.</font>

416
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,990
<font color="yellow">- I'm good at that kind of stuff.<br>- Drink up.</font>

417
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,130
<font color="yellow">- Hey, alright!<br>- Drink up.</font>

418
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, punk. You're late as usual.</font>

419
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,580
<font color="yellow">Miss Na Ri!</font>

420
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,500
<font color="yellow"><i>So you're Oh Bong.</i></font>

421
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,210
<font color="yellow">Welcome! Just as Dong Pal (nickname) described, you are beautiful.</font>

422
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,040
<font color="yellow"><i>I can tell you're nosy just by looking at you.</i></font>

423
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,120
<font color="yellow">We started eating first.</font>

424
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,550
<font color="yellow">Dong Pal said that as long as we came out, he was buying.</font>

425
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,600
<font color="yellow"><i>Even your eyes are crooked when you look at me.</i></font>

426
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,870
<font color="yellow">These guys are the ones I call my best friends.</font>

427
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,090
<font color="yellow">Hello. My name is Do Yeo Joo.</font>

428
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,370
<font color="yellow">I've heard a lot about you from Oppa.</font>

429
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,640
<font color="yellow">I was trying to figure out what to do on our first date,</font>

430
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,220
<font color="yellow">so I looked up "first date" on the interent.</font>

431
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,680
<font color="yellow">First date outfit, first date meal,</font>

432
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,310
<font color="yellow">first date conversation, first date location,</font>

433
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,960
<font color="yellow">first date present, and the list kept going.</font>

434
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,340
<font color="yellow">The clock strikes midnight.</font>

435
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,590
<font color="yellow">The first and last date - I'm sure there's no information on that.</font>

436
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,300
<font color="yellow">Stop ruining the mood.</font>

437
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,820
<font color="yellow">They say to find common interests during the first date.</font>

438
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,520
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

439
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,020
<font color="yellow">What is the easiest thing to grow in the Vinyl House?</font>

440
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,810
<font color="yellow">Am I making this sound this too much like an official meeting on farming?</font>

441
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,350
<font color="yellow">Ah! You said the flower of an eggplant means truth.</font>

442
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,220
<font color="yellow">What do you think the flower of a strawberry or squash mean?</font>

443
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,730
<font color="yellow">The flower of the strawberries signifies a happy family.</font>

444
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,630
<font color="yellow">The flower of the squash signifies a beautiful heart.</font>

445
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,540
<font color="yellow">Since I told you the meaning of the eggplant flower, you looked it up, didn't you?</font>

446
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,460
<font color="yellow">Stop just drinking wine. Eat some of the meat too.</font>

447
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,100
<font color="yellow">You know you get scary when you're drunk.</font>

448
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,530
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

449
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,740
<font color="yellow">I get scary when I'm drunk? No way! That's impossible.</font>

450
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,780
<font color="yellow">Ah... there's nothing I can do.</font>

451
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,120
<font color="yellow">Hey! Is that all you can do?</font>

452
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,360
<font color="yellow">Oh! Our Miss Na Ri.</font>

453
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,460
<font color="yellow"><i>You are pretending to be unaware but intentionally calling me 'Nari,' 'Nari' huh?</i></font>

454
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,520

455
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,490
<font color="yellow">One shot! One Shot! It's going, going, goin...</font>

456
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,060
<font color="yellow">You're giving her too much, you jerk.</font>

457
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,130
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

458
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,120
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

459
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,210
<font color="yellow">You do it.</font>

460
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,780
<font color="yellow">Miss Na Ri?</font>

461
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,590
<font color="yellow">It's starting to get cold, and I'm lonely.</font>

462
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,260
<font color="yellow">I would like to go on a group date with one of your stewardess hoobaes.</font>

463
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,430
<font color="yellow">Hoobae? You want to meet someone in her 20's?</font>

464
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,720
<font color="yellow">A group date sounds good.</font>

465
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,460
<font color="yellow">Set up one for Nosy too. He doesn't have a girlfriend. Let him do it. Do it.</font>

466
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,920
<font color="yellow">These days, as long as you have a good job,</font>

467
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,690
<font color="yellow">they said that registering with a marriage matchmaking service is the trend.</font>

468
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,190
<font color="yellow">A marriage matchmaking service?</font>

469
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,300
<font color="yellow">No, you have to date before you get married.</font>

470
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that not a good idea?</font>

471
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,060
<font color="yellow">Of course it isn't.</font>

472
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,620
<font color="yellow">Hey,</font>

473
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,480
<font color="yellow">Do fruit vendors sell memories now?</font>

474
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, why would you want to sell your memories?</font>

475
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,890
<font color="yellow">I've heard it after 10 years.</font>

476
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,220
<font color="yellow">You still do that?</font>

477
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,390
<font color="yellow">- Do you remember acorns? Acorns?<br>- Acorns (were used on Cyworld, an old Korean social network platform to buy things)!</font>

478
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:18,550
<font color="yellow">Let's go into the chatroom. What is this?</font>

479
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,570
<font color="yellow">Wow, this noona eats really well.</font>

480
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,290
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Miss Na Ri?</font>

481
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,260
<font color="yellow">What's your favorite animal?</font>

482
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,730
<font color="yellow">How many psychology tests are you going to do? None of the ones you've done have been right so far.</font>

483
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,300
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to do this when you start dating.</font>

484
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,620
<font color="yellow">Don't beat around the bush by doing psychology tests.</font>

485
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,570
<font color="yellow">If there is something you are curious about, just ask me.</font>

486
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,690
<font color="yellow">Directly?</font>

487
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,590
<font color="yellow">Ok. Then I'm going to really ask.</font>

488
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,830
<font color="yellow">What is #18 at karaoke?</font>

489
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,630
<font color="yellow">At the funeral,</font>

490
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,380
<font color="yellow">why did you promise Mom you would end your feelings?</font>

491
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,830
<font color="yellow">What? That question is cheating.</font>

492
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,710
<font color="yellow">We are going back to the time before I decided to end my feelings.</font>

493
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,290
<font color="yellow">You're right. We are on a date.</font>

494
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,890
<font color="yellow">Then, is there something you are curious about me?</font>

495
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,370
<font color="yellow">You probably don't have any.</font>

496
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,560
<font color="yellow">Why do you read those book so diligently?</font>

497
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,830
<font color="yellow">"Dietary Habits of Successful People" "Why It's Okay to be Hated"</font>

498
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,650
<font color="yellow">"Ways to Comfort Yourself" - those kinds of book.</font>

499
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,240
<font color="yellow">Are you planning on following them?</font>

500
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,930
<font color="yellow">There are just some passages that are strengthening sometimes.</font>

501
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,760
<font color="yellow">It can comfort you or help you start new.</font>

502
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,730
<font color="yellow">Give your heart time to heal.</font>

503
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,760
<font color="yellow">Don't force it to heal.</font>

504
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,160
<font color="yellow">"How to Give Your Heart Time To Heal."</font>

505
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,580
<font color="yellow">I wish there was a book like that.</font>

506
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,960
<font color="yellow">I'll give my heart time to heal, so</font>

507
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,030
<font color="yellow">Go Nan Gil, give your body some time to heal.</font>

508
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,530
<font color="yellow">Are you really not sick?</font>

509
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,980
<font color="yellow">I told you before, but I'm really strong.</font>

510
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,210
<font color="yellow">I don't remember the last time I had a cold.</font>

511
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,920
<font color="yellow">Let's stay like this for a little bit.</font>

512
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,880
<font color="yellow">Sitting in front of the fire is the perfect date.</font>

513
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,160
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> You are mine</i> ♬</font>

519
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,770
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> You are my man</i> ♬</font>

520
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,440
<font color="yellow">It looks like it's been a while since you wore heels. How did you sprain your ankle?</font>

521
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,210
<font color="yellow">I told you it's an old injury from riding a bicycle.</font>

522
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,860
<font color="yellow">It's a problem.</font>

523
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,460
<font color="yellow">Stress, constipation, disc pain in your back, and now your ankle.</font>

524
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,130
<font color="yellow">Stop it, I told you it's not constipation.</font>

525
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,830

<font color="yellow">Did you really have fun?</font>

528
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,370
<font color="yellow">Tell me what granny said to you.</font>

529
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,510
<font color="yellow"><i>That guy Nan Gil followed Jung Im around and called her Mom ever since he was little.</i></font>

530
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Even during that hectic time when he was getting her funeral service together,</i></font>

531
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,150
<font color="yellow"><i>he purposely came here</i></font>

532
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:31,180
<font color="yellow"><i>and asked if there was anything else that needed to get done.</i></font>

533
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:37,230
<font color="yellow"><i>To Nan Gil, who purposely came to see me while Jung Im was taking her last trip,</i></font>

534
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm really thankful.</i></font>

535
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,780
<font color="yellow">Now that I think about it, I didn't do anything for the funeral service.</font>

536
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:55,380
<font color="yellow">I didn't know who was gotten in touch with to come or how it was carried out back then.</font>

537
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,740
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking care of Mom's last trip.</font>

538
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you for being by her side too.</font>

539
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,450
<font color="yellow">You already said thank you last time. It's burdensome if you say it too much.</font>

540
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,160
<font color="yellow">After meeting with Granny, I found a memory that I really want to remember.</font>

541
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,390
<font color="yellow">Why I didn't remember that time,</font>

542
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,740
<font color="yellow">and what mom hid from me and why...</font>

543
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,690
<font color="yellow">I want to know.</font>

544
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:28,690
<font color="yellow">But if I find that out, I thought that we'd really become distant and come to an end.</font>

545
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,170
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

546
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,170
<font color="yellow">Because you're one of the things that mom hid from me.</font>

547
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,330
<font color="yellow">And you're hiding something from me too, Go Nan Gil.</font>

548
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,380
<font color="yellow">Looking at how you can't answer me, it's true that you're hiding something from me.</font>

549
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:52,330
<font color="yellow">That's why I wanted to leave behind one last good memory between us.</font>

550
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,230
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

551
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,040
<font color="yellow">Joon, I'm sorry for calling so late.</font>

552
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,440

584
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:16,420

608
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,330
<font color="yellow">Those small things become lettuce?</font>

610
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,720
<font color="yellow">This is a weed!</font>

611
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,750
<font color="yellow">Do you know how smart weeds are?</font>

612
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,680
<font color="yellow">They grow similarly to whatever they are growing next to.</font>

613
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,220
<font color="yellow">When they're next to lettuce sprouts, they grow like lettuce.</font>

614
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,290
<font color="yellow">When they're next to corn sprouts, they grow like corn.</font>

615
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,490
<font color="yellow">They enjoy life so much and are so hard-working</font>

616
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,700
<font color="yellow">that it makes you sad to pull them up.</font>

617
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,940
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to be born as a weed?</font>

618
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,120
<font color="yellow">There's a use for them.</font>

619
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,550
<font color="yellow">They say that farm crops grow when they hear the sound of human footsteps.</font>

620
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:45,620
<font color="yellow">Hard-working farmers walk back and forth while they're working hard at pulling the weeds.</font>

621
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,790
<font color="yellow">Crops have to know what it's like to be protected and loved to grow up well too.</font>

622
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:55,830
<font color="yellow">So the reason for this weed's existence is to help with the push-and-pull flirting between farmers and their crops?</font>

623
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,600
<font color="yellow">I didn't wash my face.</font>

624
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,050

625
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,420

627
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,600

628
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,040
<font color="yellow">Make sure you get some sleep too. Okay?</font>

629
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,130
