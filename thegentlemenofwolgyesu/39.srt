<font color="yellow">Here you go. We are almost done.</font>

115
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:47,013
<font color="yellow">- Do you feel refreshed? - I do.</font>

<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

119
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,343
<font color="yellow">Lie down on the bed.</font>

120
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,243
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

121
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:05,183
<font color="yellow">You should lie down so that I can give you a massage.</font>

122
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,683
<font color="yellow">I really don't need a massage.</font>

123
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:10,713

126
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,713
<font color="yellow">It tickles.</font>

127
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:34,013
<font color="yellow">Wait for a while.</font>

128
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:38,613
<font color="yellow">Are you sleepy?</font>

129
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:41,143
<font color="yellow">I was tense taking the exam whole day.</font>

130
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:45,183
<font color="yellow">I feel sleepy as you're giving me a massage.</font>

131
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:49,713
<font color="yellow">I will give you a massage singing you a lullaby.</font>

132
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,313
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep.</font>

133

00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,683
<font color="yellow">He's so adorable.</font>

139
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,443
<font color="yellow">As he's sound asleep,</font>

140
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:35,213
<font color="yellow">I get sleepy, too.</font>

141
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,043
<font color="yellow">- Did you meet Dong Jin? - Mind your own business.</font>

142

<font color="yellow">And...</font>

143
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:06,913
<font color="yellow">why did you meet Mother without telling me and upset her?</font>

144
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:09,643
<font color="yellow">Do you think I had nothing to do except meeting your mother-in-law?</font>

145
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,143
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make you and Dong Jin reunited.</font>

146

<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

147
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,813

148
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,943
<font color="yellow">Can't you say in a nicer way?</font>

149
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:21,443
<font color="yellow">You seem to get old, Hyo Joo.</font>

150
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,813
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have forgiven Dong Jin before,</font>

151
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:27,443
<font color="yellow">if he had an affair with another girl.</font>

152
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:32,213
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth. He didn't have an affair.</font>

153
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,943
<font color="yellow">He just sympathized her.</font>

154

<font color="yellow">Are you adding fuel to the fire?</font>

157
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:44,583
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you scare me.</font>

158
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,743
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

159
00:10:58,343 --> 00:10:59,943
<font color="yellow">You're making cabbage pancakes.</font>

160
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:04,413
<font color="yellow">Your cabbage pancakes are the delicacy of the winter.</font>

161
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,083
<font color="yellow">As it rained and I felt disturbed...</font>

162
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,143
<font color="yellow">I thought making some fried food would make me feel better.</font>

163
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:12,383
<font color="yellow">It stopped raining, Mum.</font>

164
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:17,913
<font color="yellow">It tastes so good.</font>

165
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,583
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil loved your cabbage pancake.</font>

166
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,113
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

167
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:30,583
<font color="yellow">I wonder where she is.</font>

168
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:33,913
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

169
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,743
<font color="yellow">when I first found out Dong Jin and Yun Shil...</font>

170
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:40,513
<font color="yellow">liked each other, I felt like he was losing out,</font>

171
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:43,483
<font color="yellow">so I kind of hated her a little.</font>

172
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:47,213
<font color="yellow">But now that she left,</font>

173
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:49,543
<font color="yellow">I feel bad.</font>

174
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:52,883
<font color="yellow">Stop babbling and go up to Sung Joon.</font>

175
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:54,913
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

176
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,143
<font color="yellow">I'll bring him...</font>

177
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,613
<font color="yellow">some cabbage pancakes.</font>

178
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,983
<font color="yellow">You should eat while it's still warm.</font>

179
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:10,883
<font color="yellow">- Ms Choi, I'm here. - Hi. Come on in.</font>

180
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:13,913
<font color="yellow">Did you have dinner yet?</font>

181
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:15,813
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

182
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,813
<font color="yellow">We had tasty cabbage, so I made pancakes.</font>

183
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,713
<font color="yellow">It isn't much, but I called you over to try some.</font>

184
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:22,983
<font color="yellow">Did I bother you for nothing?</font>

185
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,743
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

186
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:26,813
<font color="yellow">I love cabbage pancakes.</font>

187
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,283
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I'm glad.</font>

188
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:31,213
<font color="yellow">Here. Have some.</font>

189
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:41,143
<font color="yellow">How is it? Does it taste good?</font>

190
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,613
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

191
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:54,443
<font color="yellow">It reminded me of my late mum.</font>

192
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,983
<font color="yellow">She used to make me cabbage pancakes, too.</font>

193
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:02,113
<font color="yellow">It tastes just like hers.</font>

194
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,713
<font color="yellow">You poor dear.</font>

195
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,143
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

196
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,383
<font color="yellow">consider me your mum.</font>

197
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:12,383
<font color="yellow">I'll consider you my daughter, too.</font>

198
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,643
<font color="yellow">Let's lean on each other.</font>

199
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,043
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

200
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:29,513
<font color="yellow">I wonder if the poor thing...</font>

201
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,143
<font color="yellow">gets three square meals a day.</font>

202
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:45,383
<font color="yellow">Are you still upset about that? Be a man.</font>

203
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:56,743
<font color="yellow">(Petition for Divorce)</font>

204
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:57,883
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - Can't you tell?</font>

205
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,943
<font color="yellow">- Divorce papers. - What? Divorce papers?</font>

206
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:02,283
<font color="yellow">We made a promise.</font>

207
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,913
<font color="yellow">I said one more fight, and we'll get a divorce.</font>

208
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:07,613
<font color="yellow">- Yes, but... - Keep your promise.</font>

209
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,713
<font color="yellow">- I don't have my seal. - You can just sign it.</font>

210
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,213
<font color="yellow">- I have no sign. - Then your fingerprint.</font>

211
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:14,513
<font color="yellow">You know I have no fingerprint.</font>

212
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:15,983
<font color="yellow">Are you toying with me? Sign it,</font>

213
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,283
<font color="yellow">put your fingerprint or seal on it. Do it.</font>

214
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,483
<font color="yellow">You've lost your mind.</font>

215
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,713
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking for a divorce over something like that?</font>

216
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:24,743
<font color="yellow">"Something like that"?</font>

217
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:27,713
<font color="yellow">Is humiliating your husband in front of Young Eun is nothing?</font>

218
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,843
<font color="yellow">This is why I had no choice but to be suspicious.</font>

219
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:35,043
<font color="yellow">What's so great about Oh Young Eun that you're talking divorce?</font>

220
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,113
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

221
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,983
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you any more, so sign it.</font>

222
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,113
<font color="yellow">Why would I? For whom?</font>

223
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:42,813
<font color="yellow">I refuse.</font>

224
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,443
<font color="yellow">Don't rip it up. Don't.</font>

225
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,343
<font color="yellow">That stubborn mule.</font>

226
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:56,983
<font color="yellow">I'm too humiliated to walk with my head up.</font>

227
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:13,143
<font color="yellow">Did that witch Young Eun tell him to divorce me and live with her?</font>

228
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:16,083
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into him?</font>

229
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,083
<font color="yellow">When I was six,</font>

230
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,883
<font color="yellow">I met Sam Do for the first time at the orphanage.</font>

231
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:29,013
<font color="yellow">I was sent there after my parents died in an accident.</font>

232
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,943
<font color="yellow">My entire world had changed overnight,</font>

233
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,843
<font color="yellow">so I just couldn't adapt.</font>

234
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,013
<font color="yellow">There was one time when I developed aphasia and couldn't speak.</font>

235
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,383
<font color="yellow">I peed in my bed every morning,</font>

236
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:45,043
<font color="yellow">so the kids teased me...</font>

237
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:47,743
<font color="yellow">and the director scolded me.</font>

238
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:52,083
<font color="yellow">- That's how it was. - You poor thing.</font>

239
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,513
<font color="yellow">Sam Do used to stand up for me and take my side each time.</font>

240
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

241
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:02,643
<font color="yellow">he can't bear to watch other suffering.</font>

242
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,043
<font color="yellow">Well, that's true.</font>

243
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:09,083
<font color="yellow">That's why I leaned on him...</font>

244
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,713
<font color="yellow">as if he were my real brother,</font>

245
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:15,713
<font color="yellow">and he protected me like his real sister.</font>

246
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:18,843
<font color="yellow">Sam Do and I...</font>

247
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,943
<font color="yellow">like comrades who fought a war together.</font>

248
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:26,613
<font color="yellow">There's nothing romantic.</font>

249
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:30,743
<font color="yellow">Still, I heard you were his first love.</font>

250
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:32,613
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

251
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:36,483
<font color="yellow">because we met when we were highly emotional.</font>

252
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:40,143
<font color="yellow">It's like a childhood memory.</font>

253
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:44,383
<font color="yellow">Nothing that you worry about will ever happen.</font>

254
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,613
<font color="yellow">But of all the neighbourhoods,</font>

255
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,283
<font color="yellow">why did you move here?</font>

256
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,483
<font color="yellow">After my husband suddenly passed away,</font>

257
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,313
<font color="yellow">I didn't know how to survive.</font>

258
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:59,713
<font color="yellow">I felt like there was no one in the entire world...</font>

259
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,383
<font color="yellow">who was on my side.</font>

260
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:03,143
<font color="yellow">Then suddenly...</font>

261
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,643
<font color="yellow">I remembered Sam Do.</font>

262
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,983
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure whether or not...</font>

263
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:12,143
<font color="yellow">he was still working at the tailor shop,</font>

264
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:17,053
<font color="yellow">but I wanted to go where the last person on my side...</font>

265
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:19,583
<font color="yellow">may possibly be.</font>

266
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:23,013
<font color="yellow">That's why I moved here,</font>

267
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:26,713
<font color="yellow">but if it bothers you that much,</font>

268
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,683
<font color="yellow">I'll go somewhere else.</font>

269
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,613
<font color="yellow">Well... Well... There's no need.</font>

270
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,983
<font color="yellow">I've always received from Sam Do.</font>

271
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,083
<font color="yellow">I can do that much for him.</font>

272
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:42,613
<font color="yellow">I want him to be happy more than anyone.</font>

273
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:45,943
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have gone against her word...</font>

274
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:47,783
<font color="yellow">after saying all that.</font>

275
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:53,643
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head.</font>

276
00:17:57,913 --> 00:17:59,413
<font color="yellow">I have a headache.</font>

277
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,213
<font color="yellow">We're home.</font>

278
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,553
<font color="yellow">- What? - Were you asleep?</font>

279
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,583
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

280
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,143
<font color="yellow">I must've dozed off.</font>

281
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,213
<font color="yellow">You look really happy.</font>

282
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,813
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to you.</font>

283
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:38,183
<font color="yellow">I booked the hotel.</font>

284
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:41,083
<font color="yellow">- Hotel? - For the wedding.</font>

285
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,783
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

286
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,613
<font color="yellow">How could my only son get married...</font>

287
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:48,743
<font color="yellow">- because of reporters? - Mum.</font>

288
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:51,343
<font color="yellow">What? Are you hurt?</font>

289
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,643
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

290
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,583
<font color="yellow">I'll work much harder...</font>

291
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:58,443
<font color="yellow">and become a daughter-in-law that you like.</font>

292
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,283
<font color="yellow">Just like an announcer.</font>

293
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:01,713
<font color="yellow">What a smooth talker.</font>

294
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:04,553
<font color="yellow">- Where's Hyo Won? - She must be in her room.</font>

295
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,113
<font color="yellow">She should be with Tae Yang.</font>

296
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,643
<font color="yellow">What are they doing alone in the room? Move away.</font>

297
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:15,283
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

298
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:17,513
<font color="yellow">Did Tae Yang come here again?</font>

299
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,683
<font color="yellow">That punk.</font>

300
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:21,083
<font color="yellow">This is so annoying.</font>

301
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:22,783
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

302
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,213
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

303
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:27,483
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

304
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,613
<font color="yellow">Why you crazy...</font>

305
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,783
<font color="yellow">Hey! Get away from each other right now!</font>

306
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,213
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

307
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,143
<font color="yellow">I was giving you a facial massage...</font>

308
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,513
<font color="yellow">- and got sleepy, so I slept. - What?</font>

309
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:43,553
<font color="yellow">You're dead.</font>

310
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:46,053
<font color="yellow">- What did you do to my sister? - What do you mean?</font>

311
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,053
<font color="yellow">Like you don't know?</font>

312
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:49,553
<font color="yellow">What did you do to that naive kid?</font>

313
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,243
<font color="yellow">- Let go of him! - Stay out of it, brat.</font>

314
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,343
<font color="yellow">Get up. Get up, you rat.</font>

315
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,883
<font color="yellow">- Hey, hey, hey. - While we're at it, let's fight.</font>

316
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,713
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this? Please calm down.</font>

317
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,783
<font color="yellow">Why should I calm down?</font>

318
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,513
<font color="yellow">You're banned from our house from this moment on.</font>

319
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,053
<font color="yellow">Who are you to ban him?</font>

320
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,213
<font color="yellow">If you bother Tae Yang, I won't forgive you!</font>

321
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:13,313
<font color="yellow">- You can't his your brother. - Stay out of it!</font>

322
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,013
<font color="yellow">- Get out! - Hey!</font>

323
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:16,813
<font color="yellow">Freeze!</font>

324
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,483
<font color="yellow">If you keep fighting like this,</font>

325
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,243
<font color="yellow">I'll break up all four of you!</font>

326
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:26,683
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang. Ji Yun.</font>

327
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,343
<font color="yellow">Hwo Won. Tae Yang!</font>

328
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:32,553
<font color="yellow">You fight whenever you meet.</font>

329
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:34,413
<font color="yellow">If you keep fighting like this,</font>

330
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:39,813
<font color="yellow">both couples will have to break up!</font>

331
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:41,513
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Mother.</font>

332
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,713
<font color="yellow">You must be in a bad mood because of my brother.</font>

333
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:00,343
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - It was understandable.</font>

334
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,983
<font color="yellow">I must have been tired from the exam.</font>

335
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,143
<font color="yellow">I didn't realize I fell asleep.</font>

336
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,583
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

337
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,883
<font color="yellow">It was my fault that made you grabbed by the collar.</font>

338
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:16,053
<font color="yellow">How could you fall asleep next to a man like it's nothing?</font>

339
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,813
<font color="yellow">I wasn't nothing.</font>

340
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,283
<font color="yellow">I was very nervous.</font>

341
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,243
<font color="yellow">But I really liked it.</font>

342
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:29,983
<font color="yellow">Let's get married soon.</font>

343
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:33,053
<font color="yellow">Then I can fall asleep with you every day...</font>

344
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,513
<font color="yellow">without worrying about Mum or Hyo Sang.</font>

345
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:47,013
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

346
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:51,313
<font color="yellow">I'm not ready yet, so give me a little time.</font>

347
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:56,283
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

348
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,513
<font color="yellow">Your mother and brother will be waiting.</font>

349
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:02,813
<font color="yellow">My energy's been depleted. I can't walk home.</font>

350
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:07,813
<font color="yellow">Let's see. To go from the gate to the door,</font>

351
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,783
<font color="yellow">a 30-percent charge should suffice.</font>

352
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,983
<font color="yellow">What about the walk from the door to the staircase?</font>

353
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:20,743
<font color="yellow">Okay, 20 percent more.</font>

354
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,113
<font color="yellow">I've been charged 50 percent.</font>

355
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,683
<font color="yellow">But I need to go to my room from the staircase...</font>

356
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,043
<font color="yellow">in order to sleep.</font>

357
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:32,483
<font color="yellow">50 percent won't suffice?</font>

358
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:35,513
<font color="yellow">It's not enough. Fill it up, please.</font>

359
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:46,683
<font color="yellow">100 percent fully charged.</font>

360
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:49,383
<font color="yellow">Okay, then you should go.</font>

361
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:51,783
<font color="yellow">Okay. Get home safely, Darling.</font>

362
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:23,883
<font color="yellow">What a sight.</font>

363
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:26,583
<font color="yellow">Were you peeking?</font>

364
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,483
<font color="yellow">I wasn't peeking.</font>

365
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,713
<font color="yellow">I was waiting to talk to you and happened to see it.</font>

366
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:33,083
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

367
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,243
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, are you really going to do this?</font>

368
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,043
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

369
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,383
<font color="yellow">I should give him this.</font>

370
00:23:57,243 --> 00:24:00,243
<font color="yellow">You still haven't told Hyo Won about us, have you?</font>

371
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,743
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking?</font>

372
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,713
<font color="yellow">The longer you drag it out, the more hurt she'll be.</font>

373
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,383
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

374
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:14,983
<font color="yellow">So please, stop.</font>

375
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,683
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

376
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,113
<font color="yellow">I don't plan to stop,</font>

377
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,443
<font color="yellow">so if you're uncomfortable, break up with Hyo Sang.</font>

378
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:27,043
<font color="yellow">Hey. That makes no sense.</font>

379
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:31,213
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang and I dated much before the two of you did.</font>

380
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,313
<font color="yellow">Most people call that cheating.</font>

381
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:35,543
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'll tell you one last time.</font>

382
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:38,513
<font color="yellow">I have no intention of leaving Hyo Won,</font>

383
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:42,313
<font color="yellow">so if our relationship makes you uneasy and awkward,</font>

384
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,313
<font color="yellow">you break up with Hyo Sang.</font>

385
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,143
<font color="yellow">Fine. Then I'll tell Hyo Won.</font>

386
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:53,413
<font color="yellow">Do you think she'll love you as much as she does now...</font>

387
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:56,743
<font color="yellow">once I tell her the truth about our relationship?</font>

388
00:24:58,283 --> 00:25:01,413
<font color="yellow">She'll kick you out that very day.</font>

389
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,743
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my own business.</font>

390
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,013
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun.</font>

391
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:09,043
<font color="yellow">Take care of your own life.</font>

392
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:11,783
<font color="yellow">Don't stick your nose into other people's lives.</font>

393
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:18,643
<font color="yellow">Hey, Tae Yang.</font>

394
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:22,813
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you'd hold me back this much.</font>

395
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,943
<font color="yellow">I never should have dated you!</font>

396
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:27,343
<font color="yellow">You and I never should have met!</font>

397
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,983
<font color="yellow">I need to tell you something.</font>

398
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,013
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

399
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:55,683
<font color="yellow">Remember I told you I was seeing someone before I met you?</font>

400
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:56,883
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

401
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,483
<font color="yellow">I want to tell you about her.</font>

402
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,313
<font color="yellow">Are you getting back together?</font>

403
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:02,183
<font color="yellow">I think you should know who she is.</font>

404
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,283
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me. I don't want to hear it.</font>

405
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:08,813
<font color="yellow">Please. I don't want to hear it.</font>

406
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,013
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

407
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:17,683
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang's ex-girlfriend is Ji Yun.</font>

408
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:22,783
<font color="yellow">How could this be?</font>

409
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:45,643
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

410
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,813
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

411
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:51,443
<font color="yellow">Get your act together.</font>

412
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,213
<font color="yellow">Why do you have such poor taste in men?</font>

413
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,313
<font color="yellow">What about you? Are you a good judge of women?</font>

414
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:59,943
<font color="yellow">Hey. Ji Yun is a good catch anywhere.</font>

415
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:04,283
<font color="yellow">A woman who leaves her man for a rich man is a good catch?</font>

416
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:06,143
<font color="yellow">What? What are you mumbling?</font>

417
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:08,913
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't feel like talking to you.</font>

418
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,543
<font color="yellow">Hey. I've made myself clear.</font>

419
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:19,483
<font color="yellow">I will never let you...</font>

420
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:22,613
<font color="yellow">marry that jerk. Got it?</font>

421
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:25,043
<font color="yellow">I'll give my life to stop your marriage.</font>

422
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,543
<font color="yellow">I know it's a small world, but still.</font>

423
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:53,383
<font color="yellow">How could Tae Yang's ex-girlfriend be my brother's fiancee?</font>

424
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:58,243
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

425
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:25,743
<font color="yellow">Are you drinking because you're upset about Yun Shil?</font>

426
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:28,083
<font color="yellow">Would you like a drink?</font>

427
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,243
<font color="yellow">Shall I?</font>

428
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:36,883
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

429
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:39,313
<font color="yellow">Did you finish late?</font>

430
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:42,183
<font color="yellow">Yes. A singer flaked, so I had to fill in.</font>

431
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:45,883
<font color="yellow">Anyway, have you heard from Yun Shil?</font>

432
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:47,043
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

433
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:52,083
<font color="yellow">It'd be less frustrating if I knew why she left.</font>

434
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,543
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to get angry.</font>

435
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,943
<font color="yellow">It feels like tattling, so I stressed days and nights...</font>

436
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,843
<font color="yellow">about whether to tell you this.</font>

437
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:12,483
<font color="yellow">I feel like I should tell you, and that it will...</font>

438
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,213
<font color="yellow">help you find her.</font>

439
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:17,043
<font color="yellow">Your mother...</font>

440
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:20,213
<font color="yellow">knows about you and Yun Shil.</font>

441
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:21,813
<font color="yellow">She does?</font>

442
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,943
<font color="yellow">Yes, according to Dong Sook,</font>

443
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:27,243
<font color="yellow">she's known all along.</font>

444
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:33,083
<font color="yellow">Therefore, based on my excellent deduction skills,</font>

445
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:36,243
<font color="yellow">your mother probably...</font>

446
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:40,483
<font color="yellow">said something to Yun Shil.</font>

447
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,913
<font color="yellow">It's Dong Jin. May I come in?</font>

448
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,143
<font color="yellow">Okay. Come in.</font>

449
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,643
<font color="yellow">Is the room warm?</font>

450
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:05,913
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

451
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:08,913
<font color="yellow">Did you drink?</font>

452
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:11,543
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep, so I had a drink.</font>

453
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,683
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

454
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:18,183
<font color="yellow">did you really...</font>

455
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:20,543
<font color="yellow">do it?</font>

456
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:22,643
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

457
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,213
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

458
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:26,443
<font color="yellow">tell Yun Shil...</font>

459
00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:29,413
<font color="yellow">to leave?</font>

460
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:34,543
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

461
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:37,443
<font color="yellow">I told her to leave.</font>

462
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:40,813
<font color="yellow">I told her that I'll never accept her as my daughter-in-law,</font>

463
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:45,043
<font color="yellow">and to leave our house as well as the tailor shop.</font>

464
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:51,343
<font color="yellow">How could you do that to someone...</font>

465
00:30:52,313 --> 00:30:54,013
<font color="yellow">so kind and sad?</font>

466
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,843
<font color="yellow">This is all she has to rely on.</font>

467
00:30:58,713 --> 00:30:59,913
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

468
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,883
<font color="yellow">be so terrible?</font>

469
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:06,113
<font color="yellow">Were you...</font>

470
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,513
<font color="yellow">Were you such a cruel person?</font>

471
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:10,383
<font color="yellow">Were you?</font>

472
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:12,213
<font color="yellow">Keep your voice down.</font>

473
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:15,243
<font color="yellow">How dare you say your mother is cruel?</font>

474
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:18,213
<font color="yellow">Your mother knows Yun Shil better than you...</font>

475
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,683
<font color="yellow">and no doubt did she care for her more than you did.</font>

476
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,713
<font color="yellow">If your mother said that, she must have had her reasons.</font>

477
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:25,783
<font color="yellow">What reasons?</font>

478
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,243
<font color="yellow">What reasons could possibly explain her actions?</font>

479
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:29,783
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

480
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:35,513
<font color="yellow">can't bear to see my son throw himself into a fire pit.</font>

481
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:39,443
<font color="yellow">You have bright future ahead of you.</font>

482
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,983
<font color="yellow">I can't watch you ruin your life because of Yun Shil.</font>

483
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:45,183
<font color="yellow">No matter how cruel you say I am...</font>

484
00:31:45,313 --> 00:31:47,813
<font color="yellow">and how much more you criticise me, I can't help myself.</font>

485
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:19,413
<font color="yellow">This text is to inform you that your album has been completed.</font>

486
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,183
<font color="yellow">We have posted your album to the given address...</font>

487
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,413
<font color="yellow">and I have attached a few of your best shots below.</font>

488
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:46,483
<font color="yellow">If Mother had said something like that, you should have told me.</font>

489
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,083
<font color="yellow">How could you just leave like that?</font>

490
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:08,043

492

493
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:19,183
<font color="yellow">A bit more, please.</font>

494
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:24,913
<font color="yellow">- Are you alright? - Yes.</font>

495
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,453
<font color="yellow">You can't just go to work like that.</font>

496
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:38,453
<font color="yellow">You should eat your breakfast.</font>

497

<font color="yellow">(I'm not eating anything you cook.)</font>

498

<font color="yellow">"I'm not eating anything you cook."</font>

499
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:58,113
<font color="yellow">How can a man be so narrow-minded?</font>

500
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,243
<font color="yellow">You're not going to eat over something like that?</font>

501
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:06,483
<font color="yellow">I formally apologised to Yeong Eun...</font>

502
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,313
<font color="yellow">and she told me she understands.</font>

503
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:11,243
<font color="yellow">So, you should forgive me, too.</font>

504
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,613
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to act this way?</font>

505
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,843
<font color="yellow">Why on earth are you not speaking with me?</font>

506
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:28,043
<font color="yellow">(I refuse to speak with you.)</font>

507
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,013
<font color="yellow">People make mistakes!</font>

508
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:33,683
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like such a girl and refusing to talk...</font>

509
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:35,283
<font color="yellow">over such a small issue?</font>

510
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:46,543
<font color="yellow">That man is becoming more stubborn...</font>

511
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,643
<font color="yellow">and narrow-minded as he gets older.</font>

512
00:35:51,843 --> 00:35:52,983
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I feel dizzy.</font>

513
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:57,983
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel so dizzy?</font>

514
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,713
<font color="yellow">Now that we're all here, let's eat.</font>

515
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:05,643
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin's not here yet.</font>

516
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:06,813
<font color="yellow">Maybe he overslept.</font>

517
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:11,043
<font color="yellow">There he comes. Come have breakfast.</font>

518
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,453
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not hungry.</font>

519
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,613
<font color="yellow">I have work to do, so I'll have to leave early.</font>

520
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:20,483
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Goodbye.</font>

521
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,843
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

522
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,743
<font color="yellow">He looks upset.</font>

523
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:29,083
<font color="yellow">Maybe he lost his appetite because he's upset over Yun Shil.</font>

524
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:32,413
<font color="yellow">Let's begin eating.</font>

525
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,113
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the wonderful meal. - Thank you.</font>

526
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,783
<font color="yellow">This looks delicious.</font>

527
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:49,743
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

528
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:52,313
<font color="yellow">Can you give me a minute?</font>

529
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:56,983
<font color="yellow">If you act like this, what does that make me?</font>

530
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,453
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

531
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,383
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel,</font>

532
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:01,913
<font color="yellow">but you should try to understand Mother, too.</font>

533
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:05,983
<font color="yellow">To all parents, their children always come first.</font>

534
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:08,313
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

535
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,483
<font color="yellow">Your sister and I also left voice messages to Yun Shil.</font>

536
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:15,243
<font color="yellow">The entire family is waiting. I'm sure she'll come back soon.</font>

537
00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:16,283
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

538
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:20,483
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

539
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:22,783
<font color="yellow">When a company launches a new product line,</font>

540
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,343
<font color="yellow">it's only natural for sales to drop until things get stable.</font>

541
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,913
<font color="yellow">Why should something like that make the news?</font>

542
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:29,643
<font color="yellow">These writers...</font>

543
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:33,613
<font color="yellow">They can't stand to see other people succeed.</font>

544
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:36,953
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

545
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:39,013
<font color="yellow">Yes, what is it?</font>

546
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:43,743
<font color="yellow">There's something suspicious about the CEO of Meesa Apparel.</font>

547
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,183
<font color="yellow">- Are you talking about Hyo Joo? - Yes.</font>

548
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:48,843
<font color="yellow">She's personally meeting with the major shareholders these days.</font>

549
00:37:48,953 --> 00:37:51,543
<font color="yellow">She's separately contacting...</font>

550
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,213
<font color="yellow">the board members that worked for Dong Jin as well.</font>

551
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:56,743
<font color="yellow">For what reason is she meeting with them?</font>

552
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:59,783
<font color="yellow">My thought is that she's creating a public opinion...</font>

553
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,543
<font color="yellow">regarding Dong Jin's comeback.</font>

554
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:05,383
<font color="yellow">- What? - According to rumors,</font>

555
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,113
<font color="yellow">Ms Min released the news about the drop in stocks and sales.</font>

556
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:12,513
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. This means trouble.</font>

557
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:14,713
<font color="yellow">Why can't Hyo Joo just stay put?</font>

558
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,883
<font color="yellow">Why does she have to go and cause trouble?</font>

559
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:21,583
<font color="yellow">Is anyone here?</font>

560
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:30,043
<font color="yellow">What brings such a busy person like you here?</font>

561
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:31,583
<font color="yellow">Of course I've come to have a suit made, why else?</font>

562
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:34,413
<font color="yellow">I'd like to see for myself what makes your suits...</font>

563
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,953
<font color="yellow">so different from Meesa Apparel's.</font>

564
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:39,313
<font color="yellow">You can't compare off-the-peg suits to custom-tailored suits.</font>

565
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:40,413
<font color="yellow">I guess that's true.</font>

566
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:42,413
<font color="yellow">Still, I'd like to see what makes you so confident to think...</font>

567
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,143
<font color="yellow">you can sell your suits in department stores.</font>

568
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:47,383
<font color="yellow">I'd like to wear one myself.</font>

569
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:48,583
<font color="yellow">I don't understand...</font>

570
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,913
<font color="yellow">why you care so much about the Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

571
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:53,343
<font color="yellow">Our shop is just...</font>

572
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:56,083
<font color="yellow">a small neighborhood shop compared to Meesa Apparel.</font>

573
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,983
<font color="yellow">How dare we try and get in your way...</font>

574
00:38:58,343 --> 00:39:00,283
<font color="yellow">by trying to launch our suits in department stores?</font>

575
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,983
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

576
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:07,413
<font color="yellow">Obviously, mass production of custom-tailored suites is difficult.</font>

577
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,613
<font color="yellow">That would make it hard to meet consumers' expectations.</font>

578
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,013
<font color="yellow">I only expressed my concerns that...</font>

579
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:14,113
<font color="yellow">that sort of situation might cause a negative effect...</font>

580
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,843
<font color="yellow">on the entire suit industry.</font>

581
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:18,143
<font color="yellow">That's our business.</font>

582
00:39:18,243 --> 00:39:19,313
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

583
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:22,983
<font color="yellow">I heard Hyo Joo was going around</font>

584
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:26,013
<font color="yellow">saying that your returning to the company.</font>

585
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:27,243
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

586
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:28,843
<font color="yellow">Then what will happen to this tailor shop?</font>

587
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:32,183
<font color="yellow">Do you want to fight with me again over taking control of the company?</font>

588
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:34,343
<font color="yellow">What's coming out of your sister's mouth has nothing to do with me.</font>

589
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:37,613
<font color="yellow">I was just about to leave, so you stay and order your suit.</font>

590
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:39,043
<font color="yellow">Master Bae here is...</font>

591
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:41,953
<font color="yellow">much more skilled than the experts at Meesa Apparel.</font>

592
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,453
<font color="yellow">Master Bae.</font>

593
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:44,953
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Lee.</font>

594
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:46,843
<font color="yellow">Please make both a coat and a suit...</font>

595
00:39:46,953 --> 00:39:48,413
<font color="yellow">- for this young man sitting here. - Okay.</font>

596
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:50,113
<font color="yellow">Then I'll let you take care of your business.</font>

597
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,113
<font color="yellow">He always has to act so conceited.</font>

598
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,683
<font color="yellow">Would you like to order a suit?</font>

599
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:00,513
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Please let me measure you.</font>

600
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:01,613
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

601
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:07,513
<font color="yellow">Hold your arms up towards the front, please.</font>

602
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:08,683
<font color="yellow">Arms to the front.</font>

603
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,543
<font color="yellow">- Relax your shoulders. - Okay.</font>

604
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,413
<font color="yellow">Next,</font>

605
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,983
<font color="yellow">lie down touching the floor with both hands.</font>

606
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:19,713
<font color="yellow">- The floor? - Yes. That's how it's done here.</font>

607
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:21,213
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

608
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:22,243
<font color="yellow">Are you being serious?</font>

609
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:25,113
<font color="yellow">Alright.</font>

610
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:27,813
<font color="yellow">Who measures like this?</font>

611
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:29,113
<font color="yellow">- Relax your shoulders, please. - Yes.</font>

612
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:32,183
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I left the measurement...</font>

613
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:33,283
<font color="yellow">recording sheets downstairs.</font>

614
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:35,213
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back with them.</font>

615
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:36,913
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Downstairs?</font>

616
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:40,313
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey. Master Bae.</font>

617
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:43,083
<font color="yellow">You left your hot coffee on my back. It's hot!</font>

618
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,543
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?</font>

619
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,543
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

620
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,213
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil,</font>

621
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,643
<font color="yellow">after your finished working here, could you gather up the products...</font>

622
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:03,453
<font color="yellow">and make a delivery to the farmer's market in Seoul?</font>

623
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,783
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

624
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:09,043
<font color="yellow">You're good at everything you do.</font>

625
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:11,983
<font color="yellow">You're such a blessing to us all.</font>

626
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,483
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from Yun Shil?</font>

627
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:19,453
<font color="yellow">No. And I sent dozens of texts and voice mails.</font>

628
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:21,343
<font color="yellow">Should we call the police?</font>

629
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,813
<font color="yellow">I've been wondering if Gi Pyo's minions...</font>

630
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:26,383
<font color="yellow">somehow got to her.</font>

631
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,083
<font color="yellow">I don't think so. Don't worry.</font>

632
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:33,183
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Tell me as soon as you hear from her.</font>

633
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:34,343
<font color="yellow">I'll do the same.</font>

634
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,983
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

635
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:46,643
<font color="yellow">Is Hyo Won still in bed?</font>

636
00:41:49,313 --> 00:41:51,243
<font color="yellow">(To Hyo Won)</font>

637
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:52,743
<font color="yellow">Are you still dreaming?</font>

638
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,713
<font color="yellow">Is she still asleep?</font>

639
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,213
<font color="yellow">I'll be late for work.</font>

640
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:15,413
<font color="yellow">(Are you still dreaming?)</font>

641
00:42:16,713 --> 00:42:18,083
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you one last time.</font>

642
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,043
<font color="yellow">I have no intention of leaving Hyo Won,</font>

643
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,953
<font color="yellow">so if our relationship makes you uneasy and awkward,</font>

644
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,683
<font color="yellow">you break up with Hyo Sang.</font>

645
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:30,383
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

646
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:32,813
<font color="yellow">Then I'll tell Hyo Won.</font>

647
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:37,113
<font color="yellow">Do you think she'll love you as much as she does now...</font>

648
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:40,483
<font color="yellow">once I tell her the truth about our relationship?</font>

649
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,183
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be Ji Yun? There are plenty of other girls.</font>

650
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:49,343
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, are you still asleep?</font>

651
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,343
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you sick?</font>

652
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,183
<font color="yellow">I'm coming down with something.</font>

653
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:08,013
<font color="yellow">You don't have a fever.</font>

654
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:11,513
<font color="yellow">- I want to sleep. - Okay.</font>

655
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:13,643
<font color="yellow">Did you take some medicine?</font>

656
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:15,143
<font color="yellow">I did just now.</font>

657
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:18,113
<font color="yellow">Try to sleep.</font>

658
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:21,683
<font color="yellow">If you still feel sick after that, I'll take you to see a doctor.</font>

659
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:23,513
<font color="yellow">Okay, thanks.</font>

660
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,113
<font color="yellow">He didn't mean to hide it.</font>

661
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:37,113
<font color="yellow">He wanted to tell me and I didn't let him.</font>

662
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,413
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang did nothing wrong.</font>

663
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:40,913
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

664
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:43,713
<font color="yellow">He should have told me even when I told him not to.</font>

665
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,213
<font color="yellow">His ex is about to become my sister-in-law.</font>

666
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:48,083
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

667
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:50,113
<font color="yellow">I'm coming for you, Tae Yang.</font>

668
00:43:57,783 --> 00:43:59,283
<font color="yellow">Here's the menu.</font>

669
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:03,513
<font color="yellow">Half-fried, half-soy, please.</font>

670
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:06,413
<font color="yellow">Sure. That's our best-seller.</font>

671
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,783
<font color="yellow">Half-fried, half-spicy.</font>

672
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:13,383
<font color="yellow">Can I go to the pharmacy?</font>

673
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:20,413
<font color="yellow">I feel so dizzy.</font>

674
00:44:21,813 --> 00:44:24,383
<font color="yellow">Why is everything spinning?</font>

675
00:44:30,813 --> 00:44:32,743
<font color="yellow">Mrs Bok. Mrs Bok!</font>

676
00:44:33,613 --> 00:44:35,443
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

677
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:38,413
<font color="yellow">Mrs Bok. Are you okay?</font>

678
00:44:39,683 --> 00:44:41,343
<font color="yellow">Do you know who I am?</font>

679
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:47,643
<font color="yellow">I'm usually very healthy and I rarely catch a cold.</font>

680
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,443
<font color="yellow">Suddenly everything around me started to spin...</font>

681
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:52,913
<font color="yellow">and then I fainted.</font>

682
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:55,813
<font color="yellow">Did you have any other symptoms?</font>

683
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:57,643
<font color="yellow">Such as migraines?</font>

684
00:44:57,643 --> 00:45:01,243
<font color="yellow">Yes, I've been having headaches.</font>

685
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:04,543
<font color="yellow">Once I get them, it feels like my head's breaking apart.</font>

686
00:45:04,543 --> 00:45:06,083
<font color="yellow">My eyes are dim...</font>

687
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:08,583
<font color="yellow">and I feel nauseous as well.</font>

688
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,083
<font color="yellow">Maybe that's why, but I forget...</font>

689
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,083
<font color="yellow">things I said just a while ago.</font>

690
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:17,043
<font color="yellow">Do you have hearing problems or do your hands or feet feel numb?</font>

691
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:19,213
<font color="yellow">Do you think your senses are dulling?</font>

692
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,383
<font color="yellow">I guess you could say that.</font>

693
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:27,413
<font color="yellow">Actually, I've been under a lot of stress lately.</font>

694
00:45:27,913 --> 00:45:30,343
<font color="yellow">That could be the cause of the headaches.</font>

695
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:32,883
<font color="yellow">I feel better after a lie down.</font>

696
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:37,913
<font color="yellow">I think you need a thorough examination.</font>

697
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,583
<font color="yellow">An examination?</font>

698
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:44,143
<font color="yellow">Headaches have so many causes, so I'll need to run some tests.</font>

699
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,183
<font color="yellow">Based on your symptoms...</font>

700
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,643
<font color="yellow">you could have a brain haemorrhage or a tumour.</font>

701
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:50,813
<font color="yellow">A brain tumour?</font>

702
00:45:52,813 --> 00:45:55,843
<font color="yellow">Isn't a tumour cancer?</font>

703
00:45:56,743 --> 00:45:58,713
<font color="yellow">Do I have cancer?</font>

704
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,483
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

705
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:03,313
<font color="yellow">will I die?</font>

706
00:46:03,313 --> 00:46:05,043
<font color="yellow">It's just a possibility.</font>

707
00:46:05,713 --> 00:46:08,383
<font color="yellow">The test results will reveal what it is.</font>

708
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,413
<font color="yellow">We'll run the tests right now.</font>

709
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,813
<font color="yellow">The results take a few days, so I'll see you then.</font>

710
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,243
<font color="yellow">No wonder.</font>

711
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:18,313
<font color="yellow">I'd been having weird headaches.</font>

712
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,683
<font color="yellow">I'd never had headaches before.</font>

713
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,583
<font color="yellow">Do I have cancer?</font>

714
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:35,143
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

715
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:39,643
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? You didn't say you'd visit.</font>

716
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,543
<font color="yellow">I came to see you.</font>

717
00:46:41,543 --> 00:46:42,613
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

718
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:43,743
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

719
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:46,913
<font color="yellow">Wait while I bring some tea.</font>

720
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:49,383
<font color="yellow">Forget the tea and sit down.</font>

721
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:50,883
<font color="yellow">Okay. Shall I?</font>

722
00:46:55,143 --> 00:46:57,513
<font color="yellow">One is for your staff...</font>

723
00:46:57,513 --> 00:47:00,013
<font color="yellow">and one is for your wife.</font>

724
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:03,283
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

725
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:05,883
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.</font>

726
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,783
<font color="yellow">You don't have to apologise.</font>

727
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,743
<font color="yellow">I should've stopped my wife.</font>

728
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,343
<font color="yellow">I'm such a terrible husband.</font>

729
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,143
<font color="yellow">I was so jealous.</font>

730
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:17,543
<font color="yellow">You always yearned to be loved...</font>

731
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:21,083
<font color="yellow">and it was good to see your wife loves you very much.</font>

732
00:47:21,843 --> 00:47:24,683
<font color="yellow">Her kind of love can be suffocating.</font>

733
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:32,813
<font color="yellow">You're home early. We're...</font>

734
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,113
<font color="yellow">Is she sick or something?</font>

735
00:47:39,113 --> 00:47:41,613
<font color="yellow">She had a huge fight with Sam Do yesterday.</font>

736
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:46,443
<font color="yellow">Both Dong Jin and Sam Do are going through a rough patch.</font>

737
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:49,583
<font color="yellow">I feel guilty to act like newly married couples.</font>

738
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,743
<font color="yellow">Even my phone's letting me down.</font>

739
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,543
<font color="yellow">Hello, you reached Tae Pyung, the Gentleman of Trot.</font>

740
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,743
<font color="yellow">The Sparling Festival?</font>

741
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,213
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course I can come and sing.</font>

742
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,913
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is Lee Dong Sook, Tae Pyung's manager.</font>

743
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:17,113
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

744
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:19,513
<font color="yellow">You can negotiate with me.</font>

745
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:22,083
<font color="yellow">What's there to negotiate? Just say I'll do it.</font>

746
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:27,513
<font color="yellow">He should be paid as much as any competitor would pay him.</font>

747
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,113
<font color="yellow">Give him 30 more dollars.</font>

748
00:48:31,483 --> 00:48:33,343
<font color="yellow">We have to pay for...</font>

749
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,313
<font color="yellow">petrol and food, you know.</font>

750
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:37,883
<font color="yellow">Yes. Of course.</font>

751
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,813
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much. Bye.</font>

752
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:45,413
<font color="yellow">Really? 30 more dollars?</font>

753
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,343
<font color="yellow">(Deposit)</font>

754
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:52,383
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Just a moment.</font>

755
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:57,243
<font color="yellow">You're not from here, are you?</font>

756
00:48:57,913 --> 00:49:00,913
<font color="yellow">I'm not. I just started working at a nearby farm.</font>

757
00:49:00,913 --> 00:49:02,913
<font color="yellow">It's a small neighbourhood...</font>

758
00:49:02,913 --> 00:49:05,713
<font color="yellow">so I know most of the regulars.</font>

759
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:07,213
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

760
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,113
<font color="yellow">You don't have a passbook.</font>

761
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,143
<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

762
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,243
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

763
00:49:16,383 --> 00:49:17,443
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

764
00:49:17,443 --> 00:49:19,343
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

765
00:49:19,343 --> 00:49:20,343
<font color="yellow">Much better.</font>

766
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:21,843
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

767
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:23,183
<font color="yellow">They were a gift.</font>

768
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:24,483
<font color="yellow">One's for my wife.</font>

769
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:26,543
<font color="yellow">What great timing.</font>

00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,713
<font color="yellow">I was wanting something sweet for dessert.</font>

771
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:32,213
<font color="yellow">Are you in?</font>

772
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:35,713
<font color="yellow">What's she doing back here?</font>

773
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,083
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

774
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,343
<font color="yellow">I had some time to think.</font>

775
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:43,083
<font color="yellow">Did you smuggle Yun Shil away because...</font>

776
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,083
<font color="yellow">you got afraid my son is getting paroled?</font>

777
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,043
<font color="yellow">That's not true. Please leave.</font>

778
00:49:47,043 --> 00:49:49,583
<font color="yellow">If you didn't smuggle her away,</font>

779
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,583
<font color="yellow">why else would she suddenly leave?</font>

780
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,543
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking us that?</font>

781
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:55,483
<font color="yellow">We're going crazy ourselves.</font>

782
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:59,043
<font color="yellow">I could have my son's boys go and look for her.</font>

783
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:02,213
<font color="yellow">You can do whatever you want.</font>

784
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:04,313
<font color="yellow">Give me this month's rent.</font>

785
00:50:04,313 --> 00:50:05,383
<font color="yellow">Why ask me for it?</font>

786
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:06,883
<font color="yellow">Who else should I get it from?</font>

787
00:50:06,883 --> 00:50:09,943
<font color="yellow">Get it from whoever rented the place, not me.</font>

788
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:12,843
<font color="yellow">You kicked out my tenant to move in yourself.</font>

789
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,583
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense. I'm not paying you anything.</font>

790
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:19,683
<font color="yellow">If you want your rent, find Yun Shil and get it from her.</font>

791

00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,983
<font color="yellow">Did she text you?</font>

799
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:43,713
<font color="yellow">The text isn't from her exactly.</font>

800
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:45,743

801
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,143

802
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:50,313

803
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,413

804
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,683
<font color="yellow">I will if you give me your ID card.</font>

805

<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

806
00:50:58,743 --> 00:51:02,213
<font color="yellow">It came through one of our branches, so I can tell you right away.</font>

807
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:06,913
<font color="yellow">It was wired from Hwaseong Central branch by Ms Na Yun Shil.</font>

808

<font color="yellow">- Hwaseong Central branch? - Yes.</font>

809

810
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:17,283
<font color="yellow">If my mum said that to you, you should have told me about it.</font>

811
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:19,543
<font color="yellow">Why did you just leave?</font>

812
00:51:20,383 --> 00:51:22,143
<font color="yellow">Wait for me. I'm coming over.</font>

813
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:28,613
<font color="yellow">How could sweet Dong Jin talk back at me like that?</font>

814
00:51:29,843 --> 00:51:31,913
<font color="yellow">My heart's still pounding.</font>

815
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:33,683
<font color="yellow">He got frustrated...</font>

816
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:36,983
<font color="yellow">and raised his voice. He didn't talk back.</font>

817
00:51:37,283 --> 00:51:38,443
<font color="yellow">Don't get too upset.</font>

818
00:51:41,443 --> 00:51:43,313
<font color="yellow">Even so,</font>

819
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,343

820
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:48,513
<font color="yellow">I cried my heart out once Yun Shil left.</font>

821

825
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:03,183
<font color="yellow">You know where she is, don't you?</font>

826
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:05,313
<font color="yellow">Do you not believe me, either?</font>

827
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:08,143
<font color="yellow">I said I don't know where she is.</font>
