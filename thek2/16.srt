00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,070
<font color="yellow">Um,  Mr. Je Ha.</font>

4
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,569
<font color="yellow">Calm down, okay?</font>

5
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:36,069
<font color="yellow">Let's settle this
with words. Okay?</font>

6
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,970
<font color="yellow">L-let's settle this with words!</font>

7
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,970
<font color="yellow">Where's Anna?</font>

8
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,769
<font color="yellow">Oh, Anna?
Um, she's at Cloud Nine.</font>

9
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,683
<font color="yellow">T-that's where she went.
You should hurry and go.</font>

10
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,769
<font color="yellow">You drive.</font>

11
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:51,870
<font color="yellow">R-r-right now?</font>

12
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,269
<font color="yellow">We can't go there now.</font>

13
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:57,970
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

14
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,769
<font color="yellow">Well, you see...</font>

15
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,870
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

16
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,870
<font color="yellow">The bomb... it'll go off soon.</font>

17
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,569
<font color="yellow">And when it does,
everyone there will die!</font>

18
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,970
<font color="yellow">Then you can just stop
it from exploding.</font>

19
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,970
<font color="yellow">That'd be nice and all, but...</font>

20
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,769
<font color="yellow">you can't defuse it
once it's been set.</font>

21
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,970
<font color="yellow">Chairman Choi doesn't know that.</font>

22
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,870
<font color="yellow">Oh, damn it.</font>

23
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,370
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

24
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,970
<font color="yellow">No. No.</font>

25
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,365
<font color="yellow">Stop being so stubborn.</font>

26
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:11,370
<font color="yellow">I even have Suk Han's
memory card now.</font>

27
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,970
<font color="yellow">Yeah, congrats.</font>

28
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,870
<font color="yellow">And... I've lost
everything now, right?</font>

29
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,770
<font color="yellow">What you said was true.</font>

30
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,169
<font color="yellow">I'll just have to die here today.</font>

31
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,770
<font color="yellow">With this bomb, right here.</font>

32
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,169
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you just one thing.</font>

33
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,569
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

34
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,169
<font color="yellow">JB Group wasn't included on the list
of members of the consortium.</font>

35
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,870
<font color="yellow">So how did you get involved
with Kumar-gate?</font>

36
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, that? That was a trap I set for the
consortium members with my father-in-law.</font>

37
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,870
<font color="yellow">Suk Han was my schoolmate.</font>

38
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,970
<font color="yellow">But he was in Iraq to do some
medical volunteering work.</font>

39
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,970
<font color="yellow">And he was treating Abdul Omar,
the leader of the Kumar people.</font>

40
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,270
<font color="yellow">So I asked him to
introduce me to him.</font>

41
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,270
<font color="yellow">And Father-in-Law handled
the consortium members in Korea.</font>

42
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,569
<font color="yellow">And then you left the consortium?</font>

43
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,770
<font color="yellow">Yep.</font>

44
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,169
<font color="yellow">Because this situation was
bound to blow up sooner or later.</font>

45
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,970
<font color="yellow">But Suk Han got sly, so my name
got on the list of members too.</font>

46
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,569
<font color="yellow">As a defense mechanism for him.</font>

47
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,270
<font color="yellow">What a shame.</font>

48
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,870
<font color="yellow">You would have washed your hands
of this whole affair too.</font>

49
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,169
<font color="yellow">At any rate, you were the one
who was really behind Kumar-gate, huh?</font>

50
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,169
<font color="yellow">More or less.</font>

51
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,570
<font color="yellow">But how'd you know without even looking
at the contents of the memory card?</font>

52
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,070
<font color="yellow">Through Mirror.</font>

53
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,669
<font color="yellow"><i>And Kim Je Ha.</i></font>

54
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:02,169
<font color="yellow">Wow! The more I see her capabilities,
the more I want her for myself!</font>

55
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,470
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

56
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,270
<font color="yellow">Let's wrap up this lovely
conversation we've had today now.</font>

57
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,770
<font color="yellow">Take the bomb and leave.</font>

58
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,570
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

59
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,075
<font color="yellow">Write me an official
document stating that</font>

60
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:58,070
<font color="yellow">you'll give up your
shares before leaving.</font>

61
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,770
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

62
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,169
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be left with nothing.</font>

63
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,669
<font color="yellow">What good would being
alive do me then?</font>

64
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,470
<font color="yellow">Let's just die here together.</font>

65
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,270
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's that simple to die?</font>

66
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,474
<font color="yellow">Let us out!
Let us out of here!</font>

67
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:21,070
<font color="yellow">It's just as I said.</font>

68
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,270
<font color="yellow">All right, then.
What should I do?</font>

69
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,270
<font color="yellow">Should I open the door for them?</font>

70
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,869
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that they're quite desperate to
get out and will do anything it takes.</font>

71
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:36,470
<font color="yellow">Want me to teach you what
is more difficult than dying?</font>

72
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,169
<font color="yellow"><i>A call from Chief Kim.</i></font>

73
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,169
<font color="yellow">Put her through.</font>

74
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:45,770
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, Madam.</i></font>

75
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,866
<font color="yellow">We've secured the lobby.</font>

76
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:51,270
<font color="yellow">Really? Great job.</font>

77
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,570
<font color="yellow">But there are still some scum left
scurrying around the building</font>

78
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,869
<font color="yellow">so I think it'll take a bit more time
to completely exterminate them.</font>

79
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,369
<font color="yellow">All right. Got it.</font>

80
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,869
<font color="yellow">Take your time with it.</font>

81
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:05,270
<font color="yellow">Just a moment, Madam.</font>

82
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,070
<font color="yellow">Big trouble, Chief Kim!
Anna is inside this building somewhere!</font>

83
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,570
<font color="yellow"><i>What... do you mean by that?</i></font>

84
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,970
<font color="yellow">Anna is currently fleeing from
the bad guys around this building!</font>

85
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,570
<font color="yellow">What? Why is Anna here?</font>

86
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:30,070
<font color="yellow">Chief Kim. We've received word that Ms.
Anna was dragged off the plane by cops.</font>

87
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,369
<font color="yellow">I think that Park Kwan Soo
mus be the one behind this.</font>

88
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:34,869
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

89
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,570
<font color="yellow"><i>And we can't get in touch
with Mr. Je Ha.</i></font>

90
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,770
<font color="yellow">We heard that Young Miss was
brought here, so we rushed over.</font>

91
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,970
<font color="yellow">They're trying to use her as a hostage.
Find her immediately.</font>

92
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,169
<font color="yellow">Everyone who's not looking for
the rest of the enemy forces!</font>

93
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,570
<font color="yellow">Go and look for Anna!</font>

94
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,770
<font color="yellow">- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

95
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:54,570
<font color="yellow">But it's quite a relief that she's
on the run instead of being held captive.</font>

96
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,424
<font color="yellow">Yes, Assemblyman.
We're at JSS's HQ right now</font>

97
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,400
<font color="yellow">but we've lost
Assemblyman Jang's daughter.</font>

98
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,669
<font color="yellow">What the hell did you say?</font>

99
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,570
<font color="yellow">Does Assemblyman Jang know that?</font>

100
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,570
<font color="yellow"><i>No.</i></font>

101
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,669
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have her phone, so she
probably couldn't have called him yet.</font>

102
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:48,270
<font color="yellow">Then why the hell are you
calling me, you punk?</font>

103
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,270
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and find her, damn it!</font>

104
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,369
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. Right away.</font>

105
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,970
<font color="yellow">If Jang Se Joon calls, please
try to buy us some time--</font>

106
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,970
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

107
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,570
<font color="yellow">Stop spouting nonsense
and find her already!</font>

108
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,369
<font color="yellow">Je Ha is on his way there now too!
So what are you going to do?</font>

109
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:04,070
<font color="yellow">You better hurry the hell
up and find her!</font>

110
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,269
<font color="yellow">Why, this--</font>

111
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,269
<font color="yellow">Ugh! This punk!</font>

112
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,570
<font color="yellow">Man.</font>

113
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,769
<font color="yellow">What if the news about this spreads?</font>

114
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,869
<font color="yellow">If that punk Jang Se Joon
finds out about this...</font>

115
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,269
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Oh my!</font>

116
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,269
<font color="yellow">Oh man!</font>

117
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,869
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-Law is only human, you know.</font>

118
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,096
<font color="yellow">So if Anna is held hostage, he'll give up
Suk Han's memory card, don't you think?</font>

119
00:13:58,096 --> 00:13:59,769
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

120
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:03,269
<font color="yellow">Do you think that things will really
all go the way you want it to?</font>

121
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,769
<font color="yellow">Man, I almost defused
the bomb for no reason!</font>

122
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,769
<font color="yellow">Tell those guys to come in.</font>

123
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,369
<font color="yellow">I'll just hold down
the fort here in the meantime</font>

124
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,070
<font color="yellow">until the rest of our
reinforcements get here.</font>

125
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,170
<font color="yellow">And if they don't come,
I can defuse the bomb later.</font>

126
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,369
<font color="yellow">Reinforcements?</font>

127
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:31,869
<font color="yellow">Sure. It'd be better to send
those guys away now.</font>

128
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,869
<font color="yellow">I'll just tell my men
to come down here.</font>

129
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,869
<font color="yellow">Hello, Park Kwan Soo's lapdogs.</font>

130
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:44,369
<font color="yellow">It must have bee quite
hard on you to wait so long.</font>

131
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:50,470
<font color="yellow">I'll reactivate the elevator,
so get out of here. All of you.</font>

132
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,769
<font color="yellow">Chief Kim.</font>

133
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,869
<font color="yellow">Kick out the people who
come out of the elevator.</font>

134
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:06,269
<font color="yellow"><i>Put your guns down.</i></font>

135
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,170
<font color="yellow">Chief Kim. What's going on?</font>

136
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,970
<font color="yellow">We were attacked by
Park Kwan Soo's forces</font>

137
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,070
<font color="yellow">but we're currently in
the process of reclaiming HQ.</font>

138
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,070
<font color="yellow">What about Anna?</font>

139
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,970
<font color="yellow">She's somewhere inside the building.
We haven't located her yet.</font>

140
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,269
<font color="yellow">But we will find her soon.</font>

141
00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:00,869
<font color="yellow">So are you saying that my Anna is
being pursued by some of those guys?</font>

142
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,170
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

143
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,170
<font color="yellow">Come to Cloud Nine
with Chief Joo, quickly.</font>

144
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,369
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

145
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:16,070
<font color="yellow">We have to find Anna first--</font>

146
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,269
<font color="yellow">Aren't you trying to trade
the memory card for her?</font>

147
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,570
<font color="yellow">You and the memory card
have to be safe</font>

148
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,769
<font color="yellow">in order for you to trade it,
or whatever else.</font>

149
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,070
<font color="yellow">Anna won't be safe if
you're captured too.</font>

150
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,769
<font color="yellow">Hurry and come here.</font>

151
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,369
<font color="yellow">I'll bring Anna here
as soon as we find her.</font>

152
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:37,769
<font color="yellow">Chief Kim.</font>

153
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,570
<font color="yellow">Escort the assemblyman
and Chief Joo here immediately.</font>

154
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,970
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, Madam.</i></font>

155
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,070
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

156
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,269
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Je Ha!
How did you end up looking like this?</font>

157
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,269
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry and bring
him to the infirmary!</font>

158
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,070
<font color="yellow">Where the hell are you going, bastard?</font>

159
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,570
<font color="yellow">Hey... where's Anna?</font>

160
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,970
<font color="yellow">I asked you where Anna is!</font>

161
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,869
<font color="yellow">We're looking for her now.</font>

162
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,170
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

163
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,769
<font color="yellow">Mr. Je Ha.</font>

164
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:48,085
<font color="yellow">There's only one exit.
She definitely hasn't escaped yet.</font>

165
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,369
<font color="yellow">Find her!</font>

166
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,570
<font color="yellow">Found her!</font>

167
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,369
<font color="yellow">No! You'll attract
our enemies' attention!</font>

168
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,369
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

169
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, Je Ha!</font>

170
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,570
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!
Let go of me!</font>

171
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,170
<font color="yellow">Je Ha! Je Ha!</font>

172
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,369
<font color="yellow">Don't make any sudden
movements or the girl dies.</font>

173
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,769
<font color="yellow">Stay still!</font>

174
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,269
<font color="yellow"><i>Ice?</i></font>

175
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,570
<font color="yellow">Got her.
Come to the boiler room.</font>

176
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,570
<font color="yellow"><i>Sit down.</i></font>

177
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,070
<font color="yellow">That was a gunshot.</font>

178
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,769
<font color="yellow">It's Je Ha! Hurry and go!</font>

179
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:54,070
<font color="yellow">- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

180
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,070
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

181
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,170
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.
Wake up, Je Ha!</font>

182
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,570
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Je Ha?</font>

183
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,769
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Je Ha! Please!</font>

184
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:12,769
<font color="yellow">Anna?</font>

185
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:15,070
<font color="yellow">You have to get out of here.</font>

186
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,369
<font color="yellow">All right.
Please wake up, Je Ha!</font>

187
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,769
<font color="yellow">You're here, Brother-in-Law?</font>

188
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,970
<font color="yellow">What about the memory card?</font>

189
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:01,979
<font color="yellow">Wait here. And Chief Joo.</font>

190
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,869
<font color="yellow">Go out and block the attacks
from Park Kwan Soo's men.</font>

191
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

192
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,170
<font color="yellow">Mirror.</font>

193
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,769
<font color="yellow">Turn off the "Outside
Communication" mode.</font>

194
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,570
<font color="yellow">So this is what Cloud Nine looks like.</font>

195
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,769
<font color="yellow">Entrust Suk Han's
memory card to me now.</font>

196
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:37,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, is this what you want
to take from me?</font>

197
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,370
<font color="yellow">Damn.</font>

198
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,569
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't
give this to you.</font>

199
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,470
<font color="yellow">Because I need to save Anna.</font>

200
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,370
<font color="yellow">You'll lose your chances of
becoming president if you do that.</font>

201
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:50,970
<font color="yellow">Well, that can't be helped.</font>

202
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,569
<font color="yellow">You'll lose everything, though.</font>

203
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,870
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

204
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,170
<font color="yellow">Hey, we don't have time, here!</font>

205
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,069
<font color="yellow">Are you really...</font>

206
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:10,569
<font color="yellow">going to throw away your chance at being
president because of your daughter?</font>

207
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,870
<font color="yellow">I don't know about that.</font>

208
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,769
<font color="yellow">But the reason why I wanted
to become president...</font>

209
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:21,269
<font color="yellow">was so that I could become
more powerful than you</font>

210
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:24,170
<font color="yellow">and destroy you.</font>

211
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:30,470
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure are
coming on strong.</font>

212
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,170
<font color="yellow">You should've acted
that way a bit sooner.</font>

213
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:40,569
<font color="yellow">Then I would've seen you
in a different light.</font>

214
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,170
<font color="yellow">But I'm sure that
nothing would've changed.</font>

215
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,069
<font color="yellow">I would have despised you regardless.</font>

216
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,769
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that's true.</font>

217
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:54,769
<font color="yellow">But to be honest, I...</font>

218
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,870
<font color="yellow">didn't kill Ume Hye Rin.</font>

219
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,970
<font color="yellow">And I didn't order anyone
to kill her either.</font>

220
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:17,370
<font color="yellow">Are you just trying to deceive me
now that this is in my hands?</font>

221
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,069
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

222
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:29,569
<font color="yellow">Stealing that from you in here is
easier than taking candy from a baby.</font>

223
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:37,269
<font color="yellow">Then... why did you pretend as if
you killed her this entire time?</font>

224
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,870
<font color="yellow">Because I...</font>

225
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:45,670
<font color="yellow">was afraid that you'd leave me, maybe.</font>

226
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,569
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

227
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:56,769
<font color="yellow">It was probably because
I was scared to confirm...</font>

228
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,569
<font color="yellow">that I'd made the wrong choice.</font>

229
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,970
<font color="yellow">Because I wanted to prove to
everyone--no, to my deceased father...</font>

230
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:15,470
<font color="yellow">that I'd made the right decision,
until the very end.</font>

231
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,569
<font color="yellow">And if I had made
the wrong choice after all...</font>

232
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:23,970
<font color="yellow">I wanted to prove that I could make
it so that my choice was the right one.</font>

233
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,970
<font color="yellow">You were acting all clever by yourself.</font>

234
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:34,170
<font color="yellow">But you sure are stupid.</font>

235
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:40,069
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

236
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,170
<font color="yellow">I was quite stupid.</font>

237
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:53,569
<font color="yellow">I never had to prove to
others that I was happy.</font>

238
00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:03,370
<font color="yellow">And neither you nor I
would've had to live like this.</font>

239
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:11,370
<font color="yellow">But we've already lived
for so long like this.</font>

240
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:17,970
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

241
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,069
<font color="yellow">That I made you have
to live like this too.</font>

242
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,769
<font color="yellow">You're... sorry?</font>

243
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:56,370
<font color="yellow">Did you... just say
that you were sorry?</font>

244
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,970
<font color="yellow">Hang in there, Je Ha!</font>

245
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,970
<font color="yellow">They'll take good care of Je Ha.</font>

246
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,269
<font color="yellow">But you have to hurry
to Cloud Nine now.</font>

247
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,769
<font color="yellow">As if. Says who?</font>

248
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:20,870
<font color="yellow">Says me!</font>

249
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,170
<font color="yellow">- Grab her.
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

250
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,970
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of me!</font>

251
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,970
<font color="yellow">Let go! Je Ha!</font>

252
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,370
<font color="yellow">Je Ha! Let go!</font>

253
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,870
<font color="yellow">Let go! Je Ha!</font>

254
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,670
<font color="yellow">We've found Anna, Madam.</font>

255
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,069
<font color="yellow"><i>Let go of me!</i></font>

256
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,170
<font color="yellow">- How is she?
- She's fine.</font>

257
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,170
<font color="yellow">- We'll head down now.
- Je Ha!</font>

258
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,569
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

259
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,470
<font color="yellow">I said let go!</font>

260
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,170
<font color="yellow">Happy now?</font>

261
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:51,670
<font color="yellow">Mirror. Call ex-Chairman Park.</font>

262
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,970
<font color="yellow">Lend me that for a second.</font>

263
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,370
<font color="yellow">Hello, In-law.</font>

264
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:18,765
<font color="yellow"><i>Because many of you still don't
believe that I have the memory card</i></font>

265
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:23,269
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm going to text each of you
the numbers of the bank accounts</i></font>

266
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,170
<font color="yellow"><i>you've established at a tax haven
that contain your slush funds.</i></font>

267
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Please check your phones.</i></font>

268
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,769
<font color="yellow">You needn't do this, Madam.
We don't doubt you.</font>

269
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,911
<font color="yellow">Then you should be well
aware of the fact that</font>

270
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,482
<font color="yellow">Assemblyman Park Kwan Soo would never
be able to release these documents</font>

271
00:27:45,482 --> 00:27:48,370
<font color="yellow">even if he had them, but I can.</font>

272
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:56,069
<font color="yellow"><i>If there are still any of Park Kwan Soo's
cops left in my building after 10 minutes</i></font>

273
00:27:56,069 --> 00:28:00,069
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll release the bank information
regarding the SPC I showed you just now</i></font>

274
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:02,170
<font color="yellow"><i>first to the media.</i></font>

275
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:03,970
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, yes.</i></font>

276
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:10,470
<font color="yellow"><i>Ask the president if he
got my text too, please.</i></font>

277
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:15,170
<font color="yellow"><i>Then goodbye.</i></font>

278
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,970
<font color="yellow">Long time no see, Anna.</font>

279
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:57,870
<font color="yellow">Big Sis. Open this door.</font>

280
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,569
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Hurry up and open the door!</font>

281
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,370
<font color="yellow">Mirror. Open the door.</font>

282
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:22,370
<font color="yellow">You didn't expect that
I'd have a gun, Big Sis?</font>

283
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,470
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

284
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:30,870
<font color="yellow">I thought that only those below us
used tools such as those.</font>

285
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,870
<font color="yellow">You're right. But as you know,
my family background isn't stellar.</font>

286
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,569
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

287
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:57,769
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there. Sit down.</font>

288
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,066
<font color="yellow">And you, Brother-in-Law.
Give me the memory card.</font>

289
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,170
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

290
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,269
<font color="yellow">Mirror, the elevator--</font>

291
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,370
<font color="yellow">turn it off.</font>

292
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,769
<font color="yellow"><i>The elevator has been deactivated.</i></font>

293
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,569
<font color="yellow">No. No!</font>

294
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,370
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

295
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,970
<font color="yellow">Give me the memory
card, Brother-in-Law.</font>

296
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,069
<font color="yellow">If you don't want me
to kill Anna too.</font>

297
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,669
<font color="yellow">What? So you're going
to remove my men now?</font>

298
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:35,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, Assemblyman. To be frank,
they're not "your men."</font>

299
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,070
<font color="yellow">They're the special unit
of the police force!</font>

300
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:42,070
<font color="yellow">Also, I've had many of my men
massacred due to this already!</font>

301
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,169
<font color="yellow">So how could I possibly
afford to send any more men in?</font>

302
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:49,270
<font color="yellow">My life is hanging by
a thread too.</font>

303
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,470
<font color="yellow">So you've received orders from
higher-ups, haven't you?</font>

304
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,939
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

305
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:56,470
<font color="yellow">U-u-u-um, sir.
No, that's not it.</font>

306
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,270
<font color="yellow">If you talk to the higher-ups
yourself just a teensy bit</font>

307
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,169
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever it takes
to get things done for you.</font>

308
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,869
<font color="yellow">Fine. Just wait.</font>

309
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:22,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, Assemblyman Park?</font>

310
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,522
<font color="yellow">Did Choi Yoo Jin
tell you to do that?</font>

311
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:25,869
<font color="yellow">To remove my men?</font>

312
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:29,169
<font color="yellow">You sure are quick on the uptake.</font>

313
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,869
<font color="yellow">Did she also tell you that
I could never go there?</font>

314
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,669
<font color="yellow">Both of you could go down.</font>

315
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:41,669
<font color="yellow">But the one who'll really suffer from
all this is you. Am I wrong?</font>

316
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,070
<font color="yellow">Alongside all of you?</font>

317
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,770
<font color="yellow">Well, who knows?
We'll have to see.</font>

318
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:54,470
<font color="yellow">There's 10 minutes left now.</font>

319
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,869
<font color="yellow"><i>The bomb inside of Cloud Nine
now can't be defused.</i></font>

320
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:06,922
<font color="yellow"><i>And in 10 minutes, Jang Se Joon,
Choi Yoo Jin, and Choi Sung Won</i></font>

321
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:10,669
<font color="yellow">who are all in there now,
as well as Kim Suk Han's evidence</font>

322
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,770
<font color="yellow">will all disappear off
the face of this planet.</font>

323
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:20,869
<font color="yellow">So I'll be the only one with evidence
regarding the Kumar people left then.</font>

324
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:25,070
<font color="yellow"><i>And I'll be the only presidential
candidate left in the running.</i></font>

325
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,669
<font color="yellow"><i>You understand
what I'm saying, don't you?</i></font>

326
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:34,070
<font color="yellow">I'm curious to see what you'll
be saying in 10 minutes.</font>

327
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:38,169
<font color="yellow">How can we be of help?</font>

328
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:45,270
<font color="yellow">Cut off all power and outside
communication channels to JSS.</font>

329
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,869
<font color="yellow">That's the only way
you people and I can survive.</font>

330
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,970
<font color="yellow">Just 10 minutes will do.</font>

331
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,270
<font color="yellow">Cut them off now!</font>

332
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Je Ha!
You can't move!</font>

333
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:12,970
<font color="yellow">All of you have to
leave this place now!</font>

334
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:14,663
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

335
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:17,070
<font color="yellow">A bomb is about to
go off at Cloud Nine!</font>

336
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:19,669
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

337
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:35,970
<font color="yellow">Yes. Chief Joo?</font>

338
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,470
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

339
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,669
<font color="yellow">The bomb can't be defused?</font>

340
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:48,869
<font color="yellow">Yes. I believe that Park Kwan Soo
deceived Chairman Choi.</font>

341
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,869
<font color="yellow">You must escape quickly!</font>

342
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,470
<font color="yellow">Hey, you!</font>

343
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,869
<font color="yellow">Park Kwan Soo,
you son of a bitch!</font>

344
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,669
<font color="yellow">Big Sis! You have to
reactivate the elevator.</font>

345
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,169
<font color="yellow">We have no time!</font>

346
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,169
<font color="yellow">Please!</font>

347
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:35,770
<font color="yellow">Mirror! Mirror!
Reactivate the elevator!</font>

348
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,970
<font color="yellow">Mirror obeys only me.</font>

349
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,669
<font color="yellow">Big Sis. We have to get
you to a hospital, right?</font>

350
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,970
<font color="yellow">Hurry and talk to Mirror!
We have no time!</font>

351
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,070
<font color="yellow">Please, Big Sis!</font>

352
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,470
<font color="yellow">You brazen bastard.</font>

353
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,669
<font color="yellow">Mirror.</font>

354
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,669
<font color="yellow">The elev--</font>

355
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,869
<font color="yellow"><i>The internal electricity
has been shut off.</i></font>

356
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:02,970
<font color="yellow"><i>Emergency power has been activated.</i></font>

357
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,169
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

358
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,669
<font color="yellow">- The elevator--
<i>- It has been stopped.</i></font>

359
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:18,669
<font color="yellow">Then... cell reception too?</font>

360
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:19,869
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes.</i></font>

361
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:27,169
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

362
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:33,169
<font color="yellow">Looks like your assemblyman
is the one behind all this.</font>

363
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,470
<font color="yellow">You won't need to worry.</font>

364
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,970
<font color="yellow">Your subordinates will
definitely come to save you.</font>

365
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:59,270
<font color="yellow">Anna, can you put some
pressure on this for me?</font>

366
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,970
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go out
and assess the situation.</font>

367
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,970
<font color="yellow">You're asking Anna to do it?</font>

368
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,770
<font color="yellow">People shouldn't be so
shameless, you know.</font>

369
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,770
<font color="yellow">It's okay.
You don't have to do it.</font>

370
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,468
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

371
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,770
<font color="yellow">Looks like your wish came true.</font>

372
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:17,570
<font color="yellow">Don't talk.
You'll make yourself bleed more.</font>

373
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:32,368
<font color="yellow">Looks like...
I'll finally die.</font>

374
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:43,570
<font color="yellow">Yeah... your mom was
dying then, too.</font>

375
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,769
<font color="yellow">When I got there.</font>

376
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,169
<font color="yellow">It's a bit too late now, but...</font>

377
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:04,368
<font color="yellow">I... had a father too,
just like you.</font>

378
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:12,169
<font color="yellow">But... the funny thing
about dads is that...</font>

379
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:16,468
<font color="yellow">they're never there
when you need them.</font>

380
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:22,468
<font color="yellow">But they always show up
when you don't need them.</font>

381
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:28,769
<font color="yellow">My dad found out about
your mother's existence</font>

382
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:31,368
<font color="yellow">and took action when
nobody asked him to.</font>

383
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,269
<font color="yellow">Even though I begged
him not to do it.</font>

384
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,468
<font color="yellow">And... in the end...</font>

385
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:45,669
<font color="yellow">he ordered one of his
men to kill your mother.</font>

386
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:49,468
<font color="yellow">For my sake.</font>

387
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,169
<font color="yellow">And was Master Song
that employee of his?</font>

388
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:56,769
<font color="yellow"><i>So you knew already, huh?</i></font>

389
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:01,368
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, you're right.</i></font>

390
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:27,368
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

391
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,368
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom?</i></font>

392
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:36,968
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

393
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,570
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

394
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:46,368
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

395
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:11,570
<font color="yellow">I found out that my dad had ordered
that to be done, and followed him, but...</font>

396
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:15,669
<font color="yellow">I got there too late.</font>

397
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,070
<font color="yellow">Then I realized that Master Song...</font>

398
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:31,669
<font color="yellow">was holding you
behind that door.</font>

399
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:38,570
<font color="yellow">But... I couldn't bear to
turn around and look.</font>

400
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:47,570
<font color="yellow">Because I was afraid
that I'd see your face.</font>

401
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,769
<font color="yellow">And I...</font>

402
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:56,269
<font color="yellow">Turned around to
leave, but then...</font>

403
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,968
<font color="yellow">your mother...</font>

404
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,169
<font color="yellow">begged me to save her.</font>

405
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:13,269
<font color="yellow">Please, let me live.</font>

406
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,769
<font color="yellow">And for the briefest moment, I...</font>

407
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:24,968
<font color="yellow">was considering calling 911.</font>

408
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:28,868
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

409
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:34,368
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do it.</font>

410
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:36,769
<font color="yellow">Save me.</font>

411
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,968
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

412
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,169
<font color="yellow">Love isn't meant to be shared.</font>

413
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:54,769
<font color="yellow">And... I coldly
turned away from her.</font>

414
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:02,070
<font color="yellow">Even though I could've
possibly saved her.</font>

415
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,368
<font color="yellow">I did kill your mother.</font>

416
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:19,769
<font color="yellow">And after that...</font>

417
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:24,570
<font color="yellow">I lived my life
just like my father had.</font>

418
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,769
<font color="yellow">No, I was even worse
than my father.</font>

419
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:37,769
<font color="yellow">On the day your mother died...</font>

420
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:50,169
<font color="yellow">I obeyed the commands that
the devil inside of me gave me.</font>

421
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:56,968
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

422
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,570
<font color="yellow">So you can stop
pressing down now.</font>

423
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:07,968
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

424
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,570
<font color="yellow">I'm your enemy,
who killed your mother.</font>

425
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,070
<font color="yellow">What are you planning to do?</font>

426
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,769
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time left.
We have to hurry and get downstairs.</font>

427
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:41,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, give those to me.</font>

428
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,368
<font color="yellow">Oh hey, come with me.
Let's go to the basement.</font>

429
00:44:44,368 --> 00:44:46,868
<font color="yellow">That's the closest spot to Cloud Nine.</font>

430
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, Chief.</font>

431
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,769
<font color="yellow">Can you call more people here?</font>

432
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:54,968
<font color="yellow">We'll need more manpower
to pull people up.</font>

433
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,269
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Seo.
Gather more of our agents.</font>

434
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,769
<font color="yellow">This is as far as we can go.</font>

435
00:45:26,868 --> 00:45:28,769
<font color="yellow">Man, that sure is deep.</font>

436
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:36,769
<font color="yellow">You stay here, Master Song.
We'll need more hands to pull people up.</font>

437
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:48,368
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

438
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:51,769
<font color="yellow">When I give you the signal,
pull the rope up right away.</font>

439
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:54,968
<font color="yellow">Got it. Be careful.</font>

440
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:10,669
<font color="yellow">Man, he sure is fearless.</font>

441
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:35,968
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Choi Yoo Jin.</font>

442
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:08,269
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

443
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:12,368
<font color="yellow">All of you have to--</font>

444
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:21,570
<font color="yellow">Je Ha. Je Ha.</font>

445
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:30,260
<font color="yellow">So you're finally
showing your true colors.</font>

446
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,560
<font color="yellow">We're going up first.</font>

447
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,361
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Anna.</font>

448
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:35,060
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to.
Let me go!</font>

449
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,560
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

450
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:47,861
<font color="yellow">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

451
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,861
<font color="yellow">Anna's going to get hurt, okay?</font>

452
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, Kim Je Ha.</font>

453
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,461
<font color="yellow">Send those two out first.</font>

454
00:47:55,461 --> 00:48:00,330
<font color="yellow">And she needs something
to lift her up.</font>

455
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:04,260
<font color="yellow">You heard him.
Lead the way.</font>

456
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,861
<font color="yellow">It'll be a bit heavy
if we both go up, right?</font>

457
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,861
<font color="yellow">You two can come up
after I get up.</font>

458
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:31,260
<font color="yellow">- Hey, lift me up!
- No, Anna goes first.</font>

459
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,160
<font color="yellow">Damn it.
We have no time!</font>

460
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,760
<font color="yellow">Je Ha!</font>

461
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,861
<font color="yellow">Hey, hurry and lift me up!</font>

462
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,260
<font color="yellow">Je Ha! Don't move.</font>

463
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,361
<font color="yellow">I told you not to move!</font>

464
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,660
<font color="yellow">No. No.</font>

465
00:49:11,961 --> 00:49:13,660
<font color="yellow">What about Miss Anna?</font>

466
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,160
<font color="yellow">Don't do stupid things
if you all want to live!</font>

467
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,461
<font color="yellow">- There's only three minutes left.
- What?</font>

468
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,160
<font color="yellow">- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, what are you doing!</font>

469
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,760
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way!</font>

470
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
<font color="yellow">- What do we do?
- Damn it!</font>

471
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,861
<font color="yellow">- No!
- What do we do now?</font>

472
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:36,260
<font color="yellow">You guys have guns, right?</font>

473
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,560
<font color="yellow">- K2!
- Yes, we do!</font>

474
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,861
<font color="yellow">Wait just one minute.</font>

475
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:44,560
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the signal,
so cut the elevator cable then.</font>

476
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,160
<font color="yellow">The cable?</font>

477
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,060
<font color="yellow">- He can't.
- He shouldn't.</font>

478
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,560
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

479
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,060
<font color="yellow">Anna, help me up.</font>

480
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
<font color="yellow">Je Ha!</font>

481
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,760
<font color="yellow">You have to get out of here now.</font>

482
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,360
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

483
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,561
<font color="yellow">We have no time.
We have to get you out of here.</font>

484
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:17,360
<font color="yellow">Just give up.</font>

485
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,833
<font color="yellow">It's too late.</font>

486
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:23,061
<font color="yellow">You have to hurry and get out of here!
We have no time!</font>

487
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,959
<font color="yellow">All right, let's go.</font>

488
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:32,561
<font color="yellow">There isn't a place
for me to go anymore.</font>

489
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,860
<font color="yellow">I want to get some rest now.</font>

490
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:49,061
<font color="yellow">Take Chief Kim and go.</font>

491
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:56,660
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

492
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,959
<font color="yellow">Hurry and go.</font>

493
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,561
<font color="yellow">Save Anna.</font>

494
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:19,760
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

495
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:34,160
<font color="yellow">Assemblyman, get into
the elevator now with Chief Kim!</font>

496
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:38,459
<font color="yellow">- The elevator is...
- Hurry! There's no time!</font>

497
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,660
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

498
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,959
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

499
00:51:57,474 --> 00:52:00,660
<font color="yellow">We may not have time to go
up, but we can go down.</font>

500
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,959
<font color="yellow">Every elevator has safety
features in case of free fall.</font>

501
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:05,959
<font color="yellow">Je Ha!</font>

502
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,961
<font color="yellow">So if we get down, we may be
able to survive the explosion.</font>

503
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:14,159
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

504
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:16,860
<font color="yellow">This is just my assumption.</font>

505
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:20,061
<font color="yellow">That's... a bit disappointing to hear.</font>

506
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:23,260
<font color="yellow">All right, hurry.</font>

507
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,061
<font color="yellow">All right!
Get ready, everyone!</font>

508
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,561
<font color="yellow">Cut the cable now!</font>

509
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:31,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Now!
Hurry and shoot at the cable!</i></font>

510
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,561
<font color="yellow"><i>Hurry!</i></font>

511
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,561
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

512
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,847
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Dad?</font>

513
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:57,396
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, sir?</font>

514
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:02,760
<font color="yellow">I can't save you like this.</font>

515
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,360
<font color="yellow">I have to lessen the impact for
you as much as possible.</font>

516
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,061
<font color="yellow">What are you planning to do?</font>

517
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:11,159
<font color="yellow">Anna. You've lived on just
fine without me for all this time.</font>

518
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,061
<font color="yellow">So you'll be just fine.</font>

519
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:26,860
<font color="yellow">And honestly, you don't
need a person like me.</font>

520
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:33,260
<font color="yellow">Take good care of my daughter Anna.</font>

521
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,061
<font color="yellow">No, Dad! Dad!</font>

522
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:33,159
<font color="yellow">Why did you come back?</font>

523
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:38,961
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bring this in there.</font>

524
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,461
<font color="yellow">That way, we'll be able to
lessen the impact, if only a little!</font>

525
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:03,461
<font color="yellow">This glass room...</font>

526
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:08,961
<font color="yellow">will contain the explosion a little!</font>

527
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:35,159
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go.</font>

528
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,561
<font color="yellow">So I can close the door.</font>

529
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,659
<font color="yellow">Close the door now.</font>

530
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,260
<font color="yellow">Mirror.</font>

531
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,670
<font color="yellow">Close...</font>

532
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:13,394
<font color="yellow">the door.</font>

533
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:34,979
<font color="yellow">Won't you be my companion
on the road to the underworld?</font>

534
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:08,360
<font color="yellow">We almost seem like...</font>

535
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:14,961
<font color="yellow">a happy couple, acting like this.</font>

536
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:19,461
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

537
00:58:24,961 --> 00:58:27,360
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Je Ha!</font>

538
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:38,360
<font color="yellow">K2. K2!</font>

539
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,961
<font color="yellow"><i>Answer me, K2!</i></font>

540
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:42,760
<font color="yellow"><i>- This is the Team Leader.</i>
- Please.</font>

541
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,860
<font color="yellow">- Please!
- K2! K2!</font>

542
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,860
<font color="yellow">This is the Team Leader!
Answer me!</font>

543
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,961
<font color="yellow">This is the Team Leader!
Answer me, K2!</font>

544
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,159
<font color="yellow">K2! K2!</font>

545
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:06,360
<font color="yellow">This is the Team Leader.</font>

546
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,320
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

547
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:14,159
<font color="yellow">Answer me, please!</font>

548
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:17,260
<font color="yellow">Please!</font>

549
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,760
<font color="yellow"><i>This is K2.
This is K2.</i></font>

550
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,360
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm answering. Over.</i></font>

551
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,860
<font color="yellow">Young Miss.
Young Miss, are you okay?</font>

552
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,561
<font color="yellow">What about K2?</font>

553
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,561
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey... get us out of here.</i></font>

554
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:51,360
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm in so much pain. Over.</i></font>

555
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,061
<font color="yellow">It's K2! He's alive!</font>

556
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:50,461
<font color="yellow">Do you swear to tell the truth regarding
the Blackstone civilian massacre?</font>

557
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,260
<font color="yellow">Yes. I swear.</font>

558
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,561
<font color="yellow">Ah, this is nice.</font>

559
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,260
<font color="yellow">This will be a bit cold.</font>

560
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,360
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- Ugh, I can't deal with you kids.</font>

561
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:21,961
<font color="yellow">I wonder what'll happen to us now?</font>

562
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:26,037
<font color="yellow">She did inherit the entire fortune
and lives at the main house now</font>

563
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:28,260
<font color="yellow">so I wonder if she'll ever
call for us ever again.</font>

564
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,360
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen her since
the assemblyman and Madam's funeral.</font>

565
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,159
<font color="yellow">She's not ignoring us, is she?</font>

566
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,260
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

567
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,041
<font color="yellow">- I...
- Hmm?</font>

568
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,760
<font color="yellow">only need you, honey.</font>

569
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,461
<font color="yellow">Quit it already, you two!</font>

570
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:16,760
<font color="yellow">So that means that Anna is Choi Yoo Jin
and Jang Se Joon's only heir.</font>

571
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,961
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

572
01:02:18,461 --> 01:02:21,561
<font color="yellow">Then... the Pyeonchang
Scholarship Foundation too?</font>

573
01:02:21,561 --> 01:02:22,561
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

574
01:02:23,302 --> 01:02:27,561
<font color="yellow">But it won't be of any use
since she doesn't have Cloud Nine.</font>

575
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:33,061
<font color="yellow">But she has
that dangerous memory card.</font>

576
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:38,760
<font color="yellow">I hope she doesn't act rashly with it.</font>

577
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
<font color="yellow">There's no way.</font>

578
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,061
<font color="yellow">The thing about power is that it's not
easy to give up once you've had a taste.</font>

579
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:50,860
<font color="yellow">Choi Yoo Jin was once an innocent
young girl too, wasn't she?</font>

580
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:56,461
<font color="yellow">And it's only after girls grow up
that they become witches.</font>

581
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:41,760
<font color="yellow">Well, even so, what could a young,
orphaned girl like her do by herself?</font>

582
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,860
<font color="yellow">Just you watch. She'll soon
contact us, wanting to make a deal.</font>

583
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,561
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes. Just wait patiently.</font>

584
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:53,561
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

585
01:03:56,061 --> 01:03:57,961
<font color="yellow">Let's get going.</font>

586
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:04,561
<font color="yellow">You must have suffered
quite a bit, sir.</font>

587
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,260
<font color="yellow">Oh man, I'm alive!
Thank goodness!</font>

588
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,860
<font color="yellow">I thought I was dead, man!</font>

589
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,260
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey, what is this?</font>

590
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,561
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

591
01:06:03,561 --> 01:06:05,416
<font color="yellow">You can stop now, sir.</font>

592
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:26,561
<font color="yellow">I never would have dreamed that
I'd be forced to commit suicide.</font>

593
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,360
<font color="yellow">What can we do, though,
since the world changed overnight?</font>

594
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,760
<font color="yellow">Did your phone call go well?</font>

595
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,561
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

596
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,360
<font color="yellow">What about your identification papers?</font>

597
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,860
<font color="yellow">Is everything resolved now?</font>

598
01:07:16,175 --> 01:07:20,360
<font color="yellow">Yeah. We can go anywhere
we want anytime now.</font>

599
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,860
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

600
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,561
<font color="yellow">So, how was it?
Did you have fun today?</font>

601
01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:27,733
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

602
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:31,631
<font color="yellow">I tried a day in Choi Yoo Jin's
life to see how she lived</font>

603
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,159
<font color="yellow">but there wasn't a single
fun thing that she did.</font>

604
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:35,961
<font color="yellow">I have no idea how she managed
to live when her life was so boring.</font>

605
01:07:37,117 --> 01:07:40,360
<font color="yellow">Well... shall we eat?</font>

606
01:07:42,961 --> 01:07:45,260
<font color="yellow">I love this place.
I'm always here.</font>

607
01:07:46,081 --> 01:07:47,577
<font color="yellow">- Is it good?
- Yeah.</font>

608
01:07:48,383 --> 01:07:50,860
<font color="yellow">- Anna.
- Yeah?</font>

609
01:07:51,313 --> 01:07:52,961
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're not
going to regret this?</font>

610
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:57,961
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

611
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,360
<font color="yellow">You really have to think about
this carefully, though.</font>

612
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:07,561
<font color="yellow">If you do this, you have to give up all
the power that Choi Yoo Jin left you.</font>

613
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:08,561
<font color="yellow">Do you realize that?</font>

614
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:10,159
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this too?</font>

615
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:11,260
<font color="yellow">It's been hard enough
for me as it is</font>

616
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,461
<font color="yellow">since Chief Kim has been
sweet-talking me too.</font>

617
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:14,561
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

618
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:18,459
<font color="yellow">Okay, so all you have to
do now is press enter.</font>

619
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,959
<font color="yellow">- This?
- Yeah.</font>

620
01:08:22,959 --> 01:08:24,959
<font color="yellow">Do you know what'll
happen if you press this?</font>

621
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,561
<font color="yellow">It'll reveal that the politicians
and rich people in this country</font>

622
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,459
<font color="yellow">are one and the same--</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Your email is being sent.]</i></font>

624
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,959
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on!</font>

625
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:42,860
<font color="yellow">We should've experienced
a historical moment like this together</font>

626
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,860
<font color="yellow">and we should have
pressed it together--</font>

627
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:47,160
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever! I don't want
to do something like that!</font>

628
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,959
<font color="yellow">Wow, I can't believe you.
Just doing whatever you please, huh?</font>

629
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,561
<font color="yellow">What? Huh?</font>

630
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

631
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,160
<font color="yellow">See? You're always doing
whatever you please.</font>

632
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,760
<font color="yellow">You're not being considerate
of my feelings and--</font>

633
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:58,561
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't you regret it a little, Anna?</i></font>

634
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,061
<font color="yellow"><i>What do you mean?</i></font>

635
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:02,561
<font color="yellow"><i>You couldn't restore
your mother's reputation.</i></font>

636
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,760
<font color="yellow"><i>No.</i></font>

637
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:09,561
<font color="yellow"><i>Because I got my dad in exchange.</i></font>

638
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,561
<font color="yellow"><i>- Je Ha.
- Yeah?</i></font>

639
01:10:16,061 --> 01:10:17,660

<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, Kim Je Ha.</i></font>

642
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,588
<font color="yellow"><i>What?</i></font>

643
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,260
<font color="yellow"><i>What's your real name anyway?</i></font>

644
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,160
