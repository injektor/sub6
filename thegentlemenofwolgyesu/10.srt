00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:25,438
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

5
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:40,922
<font color="yellow">It's been a long while.</font>

6
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:01,952
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

7
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:04,122
<font color="yellow">Forgive me.</font>

8
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:08,492
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

9
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:12,052
<font color="yellow">I was a terrible son.</font>

10
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:16,722
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were sick. I was selfish.</font>

11
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,482
<font color="yellow">I'm the worst.</font>

12
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:30,652
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

13
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:34,852
<font color="yellow">I can still see,</font>

14
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,882
<font color="yellow">and I can still move freely.</font>

15
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:42,552
<font color="yellow">And I kept it a secret because I wanted to sort things out myself.</font>

16
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:46,482
<font color="yellow">You must have looked into it,</font>

17
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:50,382
<font color="yellow">but what I have can't be treated or cured.</font>

18
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:52,582
<font color="yellow">If it can't be done here,</font>

19
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,722
<font color="yellow">we can go abroad and get help there.</font>

20
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:59,252
<font color="yellow">Our eyes grow dim with age and our hearing weakens.</font>

21
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,282
<font color="yellow">It happens to us all.</font>

22
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,622
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

23
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:06,522
<font color="yellow">It's not worth making a fuss about.</font>

24
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:08,582
<font color="yellow">I'm a man.</font>

25
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:11,452
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

26
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,352
<font color="yellow">How is your mum?</font>

27
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,452
<font color="yellow">She was worried at first,</font>

28
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:33,222
<font color="yellow">but now,</font>

29
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,352
<font color="yellow">she wants you to return after fulfilling your wish.</font>

30
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:39,522
<font color="yellow">She still worries, though.</font>

31
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:42,392
<font color="yellow">She wonders if you eat regularly,</font>

32
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,682
<font color="yellow">if you sleep in comfort,</font>

33
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:48,222
<font color="yellow">and if you have enough money with you.</font>

34
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,282
<font color="yellow">I'll return home soon.</font>

35
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,522
<font color="yellow">So tell her not to worry too much.</font>

36
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:56,782
<font color="yellow">Tell her she can relax.</font>

37
00:02:57,182 --> 00:03:00,382
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just come home with me tonight?</font>

38
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:02,052
<font color="yellow">I'm almost done.</font>

39
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:05,052
<font color="yellow">I'll come home when I'm finished.</font>

40
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:10,282
<font color="yellow">- Mum and Dong Sook should know... - It's no rush.</font>

41
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,252
<font color="yellow">- I'll tell them when I get back. - Dad.</font>

42
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:17,622
<font color="yellow">Them finding out about my illness won't change anything.</font>

43
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,682
<font color="yellow">Please keep it a secret...</font>

44
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:25,452
<font color="yellow">until I come home and tell them myself.</font>

45
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:27,582
<font color="yellow">Do me a favour.</font>

46
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:35,122
<font color="yellow">Did you sell the tailor shop?</font>

47
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:39,382
<font color="yellow">Sam Do decided to take over.</font>

48
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:41,182
<font color="yellow">He started working today.</font>

49
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,382
<font color="yellow">- Sam Do? - Yes.</font>

50
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:47,152
<font color="yellow">After you left home,</font>

51
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:52,182
<font color="yellow">he worried more than I did about you and about the store.</font>

52
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,222
<font color="yellow">I owe him a lot.</font>

53
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:57,352
<font color="yellow">He's a very rare man.</font>

54
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:04,682
<font color="yellow">I was quite surprised.</font>

55
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,322
<font color="yellow">I never imagined...</font>

56
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:11,152
<font color="yellow">you'd be so calm and relaxed.</font>

57
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,482
<font color="yellow">Aren't you afraid or frightened?</font>

58
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,952
<font color="yellow">For a tailor to lose his sight...</font>

59
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:22,382
<font color="yellow">is like a death sentence.</font>

60
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:25,982
<font color="yellow">Of course I felt all sorts of emotions.</font>

61
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:30,722
<font color="yellow">I was afraid and frightened.</font>

62
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:36,652
<font color="yellow">But then again, I thought about it for a while.</font>

63
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:38,692
<font color="yellow">My whole life,</font>

64
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:42,692
<font color="yellow">I got to see all the greatest suits in the world.</font>

65
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:47,622
<font color="yellow">My eyes saw many beautiful things.</font>

66
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:53,352
<font color="yellow">I guess the world is just telling me that I've seen enough.</font>

67
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,482
<font color="yellow">I saw more than enough,</font>

68
00:04:56,882 --> 00:05:01,282
<font color="yellow">so now I've been given time to prepare for the end.</font>

69
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:04,552
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

70
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,152
<font color="yellow">I'm doing what I considered doing for a long time.</font>

71
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:15,422
<font color="yellow">You have no idea how nice it is to be able to put my life in order.</font>

72
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:19,122
<font color="yellow">I know you're making suits for the less fortunate.</font>

73
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:23,352
<font color="yellow">But you can do that from home. I will help you.</font>

74
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:27,252
<font color="yellow">This is something I have to do alone.</font>

75
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:35,282
<font color="yellow">If I were to say I wanted to continue the family business,</font>

76
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,182
<font color="yellow">would that make you happy?</font>

77
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,052
<font color="yellow">I've given up on that.</font>

78
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:43,552
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to continue the family business.</font>

79
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,782
<font color="yellow">I want you to do what you want.</font>

80
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:52,382
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I don't know what I want...</font>

81
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,282
<font color="yellow">or what I should do that will...</font>

82
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,482
<font color="yellow">make me happy.</font>

83
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,852
<font color="yellow">I know this much about you, my son.</font>

84
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:08,352
<font color="yellow">You aren't a fool who would give up...</font>

85
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:12,022
<font color="yellow">something valuable so you could succeed or gain fame.</font>

86
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,422
<font color="yellow">Will you promise me something?</font>

87
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,982
<font color="yellow">Promise me that...</font>

88
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:21,722
<font color="yellow">by the time I return home, you will have found...</font>

89
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,552
<font color="yellow">what makes you happy.</font>

90
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:29,552
<font color="yellow">When I grow up,</font>

91
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:32,222
<font color="yellow">I'll make you a suit, too. I promise.</font>

92
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:35,622
<font color="yellow">You make promises with a lot of other people with your pinky,</font>

93
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:38,722
<font color="yellow">so make your promise to me with your thumb.</font>

94
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:50,222
<font color="yellow">This is how we make promises.</font>

95
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:13,922
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Where are you?</font>

96
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,622
<font color="yellow">I said I'd drive you.</font>

97
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,582
<font color="yellow">It's just a short taxi ride.</font>

98
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:19,952
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin. - Yes?</font>

99
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,182
<font color="yellow">Keep your promise.</font>

100
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:26,482
<font color="yellow">I believe that by the time I come home, you'll have found...</font>

101
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,982
<font color="yellow">what you want to do...</font>

102
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:33,052
<font color="yellow">and what you should do to make yourself happy.</font>

103
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:39,652
<font color="yellow">Your uncle got a divorce?</font>

104
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:43,122
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure? - Be quiet. Grandma might hear you.</font>

105
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,152
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won told me this evening.</font>

106
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,682
<font color="yellow">Who will you call?</font>

107
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:52,222
<font color="yellow">Who do you think? I need to check.</font>

108
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,482
<font color="yellow">Uncle Dong Jin must feel bad as it is. Leave him alone.</font>

109
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,922
<font color="yellow">Why would they get a divorce?</font>

110
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,882
<font color="yellow">Is your aunt seeing someone?</font>

111
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,582
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Mum.</font>

112
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,482
<font color="yellow">No? What else could it be?</font>

113
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,652
<font color="yellow">- Is Da Jeong home? - You scared me.</font>

114
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:16,122
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised? Were you two gossiping?</font>

115
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,952
<font color="yellow">Why would we be gossiping?</font>

116
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:22,252
<font color="yellow">We weren't expecting you to come out of the room so suddenly.</font>

117
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,952
<font color="yellow">I didn't say hi because Mum said you were asleep.</font>

118
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:26,482
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

119
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:30,182
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why I feel asleep so early today.</font>

120
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:34,752
<font color="yellow">Where's the spinach soup?</font>

121
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:38,322
<font color="yellow">- I forgot. - What a useless mum you are.</font>

122
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,752
<font color="yellow">I'll warm the soup up for you.</font>

123
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:45,022
<font color="yellow">- Wait a little bit. - Okay, Grandma.</font>

124
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:55,292
<font color="yellow">- We should be careful. - You should be careful.</font>

125
00:08:56,722 --> 00:09:00,422
<font color="yellow">A little rat keeps stealing our food whenever he comes and goes.</font>

126
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,752
<font color="yellow">I just can't dare leave the house.</font>

127
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,122
<font color="yellow">Don't be so mean. It's just food.</font>

128
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,882
<font color="yellow">I'm not one to complain about such issues,</font>

129
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,382
<font color="yellow">but look at this. He ate over half the chicken.</font>

130
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:13,292
<font color="yellow">He'd have eaten it all if I hadn't come up in time.</font>

131
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,622
<font color="yellow">No wonder there's so little meat. I thought this was a chick.</font>

132
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,882
<font color="yellow">The rat has a huge appetite.</font>

133
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:21,752
<font color="yellow">I should get a few traps from the store tomorrow.</font>

134
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:24,652
<font color="yellow">There's nothing but sauce left.</font>

135
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:34,622
<font color="yellow">The chicken wasn't worth this kind of insult. Stupid me.</font>

136
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:36,882
<font color="yellow">Just get married.</font>

137
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:39,322
<font color="yellow">Eat your wife's cooking.</font>

138
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,722
<font color="yellow">Leave our food alone.</font>

139
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,292
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook's a great girl with just one flaw.</font>

140
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,982
<font color="yellow">She can't cook to save her life.</font>

141
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:49,052
<font color="yellow">They keep mentioning her.</font>

142
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,922
<font color="yellow">- Are you glue? - What do you mean?</font>

143
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:01,482
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep trying to stick me and Dong Sook together?</font>

144
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,292
<font color="yellow">She isn't my type.</font>

145
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,652
<font color="yellow">- What's so bad about her? - Exactly.</font>

146
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,052
<font color="yellow">She's the one who should be rejecting you, you know.</font>

147
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:12,652
<font color="yellow">- Dock it from the repair fee. - Dock what?</font>

148
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,292
<font color="yellow">The price of the chicken stew.</font>

149
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,052
<font color="yellow">Dock it from the 100 dollars you owe me this month.</font>

150
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:21,422
<font color="yellow">Okay, then I'll wire you 70 dollars this month.</font>

151
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,582
<font color="yellow">70 dollars?</font>

152
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,322
<font color="yellow">Does that mean I ate 30 dollars' worth of chicken?</font>

153
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,922
<font color="yellow">That's daylight robbery.</font>

154
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:36,122
<font color="yellow">You're unarmed, but you're still a thief.</font>

155
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:38,982
<font color="yellow">The chicken stew you had...</font>

156
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:41,882
<font color="yellow">follows a recipe that came down from my great-grandmother,</font>

157
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:45,122
<font color="yellow">and it also includes my own special and secret sauce.</font>

158
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,352
<font color="yellow">You even said it was the best.</font>

159
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:50,482
<font color="yellow">Even so, I didn't eat the whole chicken.</font>

160
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:53,682
<font color="yellow">I only ate a drumstick and breast meat which was very dry.</font>

161
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,282
<font color="yellow">You can't charge 30 dollars for that.</font>

162
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,982
<font color="yellow">You made us pay 1,000 dollars to fix your guitar.</font>

163
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:00,782
<font color="yellow">- That's robbery, too. - It is.</font>

164
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:02,752
<font color="yellow">- I want a drumstick. - Okay.</font>

165
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:07,322
<font color="yellow">You two are quite the team. Are you in this together now?</font>

166
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:11,052
<font color="yellow">Hey. How could you do that?</font>

167
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,852
<font color="yellow">You can't just steal the drumstick.</font>

168
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:15,382
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat it.</font>

169
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,852
<font color="yellow">But I'm force-feeding myself to eat 30 dollars' worth of food.</font>

170
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,322
<font color="yellow">It's not because it's tasty.</font>

171
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:23,552
<font color="yellow">I don't believe this. How can someone be so shameless?</font>

172
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:27,182
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I've had enough, and I lost my appetite anyway.</font>

173
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,482
<font color="yellow">Leave it. Don't get angry over nothing.</font>

174
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,282
<font color="yellow">- What a jerk. - Let's go inside.</font>

175
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:32,422
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

176
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,282
<font color="yellow">Finish up and do the dishes.</font>

177
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:38,482
<font color="yellow">Let's go to bed, Honey.</font>

178
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,052
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

179
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:04,352
<font color="yellow">Now, it's worth 30 dollars.</font>

180
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,522
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get your face out of the way.</font>

181
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:34,152
<font color="yellow">I saved your life. Shouldn't you at least thank me for it?</font>

182
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,322
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to show off?</font>

183
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,052
<font color="yellow">I'm not showing off.</font>

184
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:42,022
<font color="yellow">You should thank your lifesaver. It's basic manners.</font>

185
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:44,822
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Thank you so much.</font>

186
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,822
<font color="yellow">I still don't believe what he said.</font>

187
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:53,182
<font color="yellow">I should've let him struggle in the water.</font>

188
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:58,182
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you asleep?</font>

189
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,882
<font color="yellow">You said you have to leave at dawn.</font>

190
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,282
<font color="yellow">Sleep well, Mother.</font>

191
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,122
<font color="yellow">Leave the scissors alone, Dong Jin.</font>

192
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,222
<font color="yellow">You'll hurt yourself.</font>

193
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,152
<font color="yellow">Shall we do it together, then?</font>

194
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:37,622
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

195
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,052
<font color="yellow">Hold it tight.</font>

196
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:42,722
<font color="yellow">Let's begin.</font>

197
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,922
<font color="yellow">Cut straight down.</font>

198
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:50,452
<font color="yellow">In a straight line. That's it.</font>

199
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,722
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

200
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:18,782
<font color="yellow">I saw a happy little boy cutting through...</font>

201
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:21,822
<font color="yellow">and playing around with leftover pieces of fabric.</font>

202
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:25,222
<font color="yellow">I hadn't had such a nice dream in a while.</font>

203
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,652
<font color="yellow">I left you to search for happiness, Dad.</font>

204
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,982
<font color="yellow">But why do I think that I feel truly happy...</font>

205
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:40,382
<font color="yellow">when I'm close to you?</font>

206
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:46,022
<font color="yellow">Will I become happy, Dad, if I return to the store...</font>

207
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:48,522
<font color="yellow">like I did in the dream?</font>

208
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,782
<font color="yellow">How could you, Hyo Joo?</font>

209
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:09,182
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me or my mum to tell us that you got a divorce?</font>

210
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:11,152
<font color="yellow">Did you call this early to complain about that?</font>

211
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,622
<font color="yellow">What do you mean complain?</font>

212
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:14,482
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

213
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,282
<font color="yellow">My father passed away,</font>

214
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:18,182
<font color="yellow">and now I'm a divorcee.</font>

215
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:21,222
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'd be in the right mind...</font>

216
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:25,022
<font color="yellow">to call and report that I divorced your brother?</font>

217
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,482
<font color="yellow">I really don't like how you word things.</font>

218
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,552
<font color="yellow">Where is Dong Jin?</font>

219
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:33,122
<font color="yellow">How would I know that?</font>

220
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:35,752
<font color="yellow">Call and ask him yourself.</font>

221
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,622
<font color="yellow">I called you because he isn't picking up.</font>

222
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:39,852
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

223
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,422
<font color="yellow">no longer his wife.</font>

224
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:46,182
<font color="yellow">Don't call me to ask about him any more.</font>

225
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,582
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry about him?</font>

226
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,152
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

227
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,482
<font color="yellow">He has you and Mother.</font>

228
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,282
<font color="yellow">I have no one.</font>

229
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:57,452
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'm alone now.</font>

230
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,622
<font color="yellow">No one's on my side.</font>

231
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:04,782
<font color="yellow">Why did you get divorced, then?</font>

232
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:08,422
<font color="yellow">You'll never find another man like Dong Jin.</font>

233
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:12,052
<font color="yellow">It's your fault for kicking away a blessing.</font>

234
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,682
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

235
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,622
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin got divorced?</font>

236
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:26,152
<font color="yellow">Mum, let me explain.</font>

237
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,682
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

238
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:30,922
<font color="yellow">What's this about a divorce? What's going on?</font>

239
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:32,652
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

240
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:36,052
<font color="yellow">Divorce isn't child's play.</font>

241
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:40,382
<font color="yellow">It's not something you can just go and do on your own.</font>

242
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,782
<font color="yellow">Put Dong Jin on the phone.</font>

243
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,682
<font color="yellow">He signed the papers last night...</font>

244
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:45,522
<font color="yellow">and packed up and left.</font>

245
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:47,622
<font color="yellow">You two came over and had dinner.</font>

246
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,582
<font color="yellow">That wasn't so long ago.</font>

247
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,582
<font color="yellow">Why did you suddenly get divorced?</font>

248
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:56,252
<font color="yellow">What on earth happened?</font>

249
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,822
<font color="yellow">He resigned from Meesa.</font>

250
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,122
<font color="yellow">Why would Dong Jin...</font>

251
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,152
<font color="yellow">quit work? Why would he do that?</font>

252
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,822
<font color="yellow">That's what I don't understand.</font>

253
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:09,682
<font color="yellow">I told him to get back what my stepmother and Hyo Sang had taken,</font>

254
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,452
<font color="yellow">but he just quit.</font>

255
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,722
<font color="yellow">How could I entrust him with our future?</font>

256
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,882
<font color="yellow">Slow down. Let me get this straight.</font>

257
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:22,152
<font color="yellow">Your stepmother and brother plotted against him...</font>

258
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:25,552
<font color="yellow">and kicked him out of the company, is that it?</font>

259
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,522
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

260
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,182
<font color="yellow">How dare they.</font>

261
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:33,522
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk over the phone. We should talk in person.</font>

262
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,022
<font color="yellow">Come over right now.</font>

263
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,352
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you. I have no hard feelings, either.</font>

264
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:42,122
<font color="yellow">You were nice to me, and I thank you for that.</font>

265
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,752
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

266
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,652
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo. Hyo Joo.</font>

267
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,522
<font color="yellow">Mum, try to relax.</font>

268
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:55,352
<font color="yellow">You can't faint. Not again.</font>

269
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:58,492
<font color="yellow">Sam Do. Sam Do.</font>

270
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,252
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

271
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,922
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's wrong?</font>

272
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,282
<font color="yellow">- Well... - Take her to her room first.</font>

273
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,352
<font color="yellow">Get on my back. I'll take you inside.</font>

274
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,922
<font color="yellow">Take my hand, then.</font>

275
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:15,352
<font color="yellow">Careful.</font>

276
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,052
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

277
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:26,782
<font color="yellow">This should help you relax. Chew it nice and slowly.</font>

278
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:32,682
<font color="yellow">What was that for?</font>

279
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:37,122
<font color="yellow">When your sister-in-law came over, you should've treated her kindly.</font>

280
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:40,122
<font color="yellow">You were always so mean to her.</font>

281
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:44,282
<font color="yellow">Are you saying they got divorced because I was mean to Hyo Joo?</font>

282
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:47,552
<font color="yellow">Do you think I let her be because I don't know how to be mean?</font>

283
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,052
<font color="yellow">I let her do as she pleased...</font>

284
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:53,652
<font color="yellow">for Dong Jin's sake so she wouldn't nag at him.</font>

285
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:55,522
<font color="yellow">This is insane.</font>

286
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:58,782
<font color="yellow">You must be so happy I got divorced and moved back in.</font>

287
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:01,252
<font color="yellow">- Who else would you blame? - What?</font>

288
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,022
<font color="yellow">Don't take it out on Dong Sook.</font>

289
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,822
<font color="yellow">It can't be her fault they split up.</font>

290
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,182
<font color="yellow">My poor boy...</font>

291
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,492
<font color="yellow">Don't just sit there.</font>

292
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,622
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and call Dong Jin.</font>

293
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:16,552
<font color="yellow">Your poor boy turned his phone off.</font>

294
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:17,652
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

295
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:21,122
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they signed the papers out of anger.</font>

296
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:24,822
<font color="yellow">I don't think they mean to get divorced. Don't worry.</font>

297
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:27,992
<font color="yellow">You know what Dong Jin is like.</font>

298
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:30,122
<font color="yellow">Once he makes up his mind,</font>

299
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,882
<font color="yellow">he sticks to his guns whatever happens.</font>

300
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,052
<font color="yellow">All this...</font>

301
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,992
<font color="yellow">happened because of the ghastly Ms Ko.</font>

302
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,922
<font color="yellow">What did she do?</font>

303
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:49,122
<font color="yellow">She plotted with her son and made Dong Jin leave the company.</font>

304
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,022
<font color="yellow">What? Dong Jin lost his job?</font>

305
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:53,722
<font color="yellow">She's a freak.</font>

306
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,382
<font color="yellow">She lured a married man and took over the house,</font>

307
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:00,222
<font color="yellow">and now she's even taking control of the company.</font>

308
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:04,052
<font color="yellow">She lured a married man and took over what?</font>

309
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:07,492
<font color="yellow">Was Dong Jin's mother-in-law the other woman?</font>

310
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:09,822
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know?</font>

311
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:13,022
<font color="yellow">She had an affair with the now dead chairman...</font>

312
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:16,992
<font color="yellow">long before his first wife, Dong Jin's wife's mum, died.</font>

313
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:19,922
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

314
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,752
<font color="yellow">Why should I tell you that?</font>

315
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:27,882
<font color="yellow">Any woman who makes the wife cry...</font>

316
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:29,552
<font color="yellow">needs to learn a lesson.</font>

317
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:34,022
<font color="yellow">I can't waste time like this.</font>

318
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:35,182
<font color="yellow">Where will you go?</font>

319
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:38,452
<font color="yellow">All this is Ms Ko's fault.</font>

320
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,682
<font color="yellow">I can't sit and do nothing.</font>

321
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,152
<font color="yellow">I shall pull all her hair out.</font>

322
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,022
<font color="yellow">She's really angry.</font>

323
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:50,182
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

324
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,382
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

325
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,522
<font color="yellow">I'm good at pulling hair out.</font>

326
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,752
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

327
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,722
<font color="yellow">Any witch who stole another woman's husband...</font>

328
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,182
<font color="yellow">has to be plucked like a chicken.</font>

329
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:05,822
<font color="yellow">She deserves to be bald or worse. Let go.</font>

330
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,722

336
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:24,452
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

337
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:26,852
<font color="yellow">Stop, stop. Stop.</font>

338

<font color="yellow">- What is it? - I'm coming.</font>

339
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:35,152
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming along?</font>

340
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,652
<font color="yellow">You can't leave me out.</font>

341

<font color="yellow">There's a special way of dealing with husband-stealers.</font>

342

<font color="yellow">I know what I'm doing. Don't you worry, Ms Choi.</font>

343

<font color="yellow">There's no time. Let's go.</font>

344
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,722
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

345
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,382
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

346
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:56,022
<font color="yellow">This doesn't look good.</font>

347
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:58,182
<font color="yellow">What if something bad happens?</font>

348
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,722
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

349
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:11,752
<font color="yellow">I had a really strange dream.</font>

350
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,922
<font color="yellow">I didn't sleep a wink.</font>

351
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:16,722
<font color="yellow">- Where are the kids? - They left for work.</font>

352
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:20,282
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo went to see a lawyer.</font>

353
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,122
<font color="yellow">I don't have an appetite.</font>

354
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:26,182
<font color="yellow">It must be because I didn't get much sleep.</font>

355
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:30,822
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

356
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:34,282
<font color="yellow">As if you'd have no appetite.</font>

357
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:35,552
<font color="yellow">Fry me an egg.</font>

358
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,552
<font color="yellow">An egg? What for?</font>

359
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:40,652
<font color="yellow">- Because I don't have an appetite. - I see.</font>

360
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:47,352
<font color="yellow">I know you're her stepmother,</font>

361
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:50,222
<font color="yellow">but how can you eat when your daughter's getting a divorce?</font>

362
00:22:51,852 --> 00:22:54,182
<font color="yellow">Were you talking about me?</font>

363
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:57,482
<font color="yellow">No. I didn't say a thing.</font>

364
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,582
<font color="yellow">I wonder who that could be.</font>

365
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,822
<font color="yellow">My goodness, that woman. What a snake.</font>

366
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:13,382
<font color="yellow">They must be worried about what's going on.</font>

367
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:15,152
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

368
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:18,322
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

369
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:19,982
<font color="yellow">It's Dong Jin's mother.</font>

370
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:21,452
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin's mother?</font>

371
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,852
<font color="yellow">- My in-laws? - Yes.</font>

372
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:26,182
<font color="yellow">- Don't let them in. - I already did.</font>

373
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:29,882
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

374
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:45,322
<font color="yellow">What brings you here so early in the morning?</font>

375
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,452
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Dong Sook. - Where's Hyo Joo?</font>

376
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,682
<font color="yellow">She's out to see a lawyer.</font>

377
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:56,122
<font color="yellow">You look familiar. Who are you?</font>

378
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:59,252
<font color="yellow">I'm Bae Sam Do's wife.</font>

379
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:03,752
<font color="yellow">That's right. I kind of remember seeing you at the wedding.</font>

380
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:06,952
<font color="yellow">What are you three doing here?</font>

381
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:08,522
<font color="yellow">You should know.</font>

382
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:12,452
<font color="yellow">You kicked my precious son out of the company...</font>

383
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,982
<font color="yellow">and made him get a divorce, as well?</font>

384
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,552
<font color="yellow">I think there's a misunderstanding.</font>

385
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:21,952
<font color="yellow">I was against the divorce. I strongly advised them not to.</font>

386
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,682
<font color="yellow">I know you didn't give birth to her,</font>

387
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:29,352
<font color="yellow">but how could you ruin Hyo Joo's life at every turn?</font>

388
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:32,422
<font color="yellow">She lost her mother at a young age...</font>

389
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:34,122
<font color="yellow">and then her father.</font>

390
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:35,822
<font color="yellow">Did you have to...</font>

391
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:39,322
<font color="yellow">take the company and kick her husband out?</font>

392
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:42,052
<font color="yellow">I really don't like what I'm hearing.</font>

393
00:24:42,452 --> 00:24:45,782
<font color="yellow">Why are you blaming me for them not being able to get along?</font>

394
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:48,622
<font color="yellow">Is their divorce my responsibility?</font>

395
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:52,252
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you said that. I hear things, too.</font>

396
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:56,752
<font color="yellow">All this happened because you manipulated your senile husband...</font>

397
00:24:57,022 --> 00:25:00,682
<font color="yellow">and stole his company from under his nose.</font>

398
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:04,552
<font color="yellow">It's a competitive economy. If you can't win, you lose.</font>

399
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:05,782
<font color="yellow">Is it my fault?</font>

400
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:08,322
<font color="yellow">It's his fault for not being able to hold onto it.</font>

401
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:10,022
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

402
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:13,722
<font color="yellow">You know better than anyone that Dong Jin's a borderline genius.</font>

403
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,852
<font color="yellow">Getting good grades doesn't equal being a good CEO.</font>

404
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:19,782
<font color="yellow">You are so thick.</font>

405
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:21,722
<font color="yellow">Gosh, whatever.</font>

406
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:23,652
<font color="yellow">Keep talking nonsense...</font>

407
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:26,782
<font color="yellow">- and I'll sue you for libel. - Libel?</font>

408
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:30,152
<font color="yellow">What about how you ruined Dong Jin's name?</font>

409
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:33,122
<font color="yellow">Sue me.</font>

410
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:35,052
<font color="yellow">Sue us all so we can...</font>

411
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:38,582
<font color="yellow">go to a judge and figure out who's in the wrong.</font>

412
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:40,822
<font color="yellow">How dare you point at me.</font>

413
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:43,882
<font color="yellow">- You might actually hit me. - I'd love to.</font>

414
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:46,682
<font color="yellow">If I think about how you treated Dong Jin,</font>

415
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:50,052
<font color="yellow">I could hit you 100 times and still not feel any guilt.</font>

416
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,752
<font color="yellow">- You evil... - Mum.</font>

417
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,782
<font color="yellow">- Relax, Mum. - Get her out of here.</font>

418
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,922
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I'll report you all for trespassing.</font>

419
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:00,652
<font color="yellow">Trespassing?</font>

420
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:03,822
<font color="yellow">We're visiting an in-law. That's not trespassing.</font>

421
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:05,722
<font color="yellow">We are no longer in-laws.</font>

422
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:07,452
<font color="yellow">I get it now.</font>

423
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:10,652
<font color="yellow">You couldn't wait for the two to get divorced.</font>

424
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:15,722
<font color="yellow">- Where's you conscience? - I did nothing to feel bad about.</font>

425
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:19,752
<font color="yellow">Did you not? Really?</font>

426
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:23,922
<font color="yellow">30 years ago. My poor little brother.</font>

427
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:28,552
<font color="yellow">You went and ruined the life of an innocent and naive young man.</font>

428
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:31,222
<font color="yellow">And now, you went and ruined Dong Jin's life.</font>

429
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,482
<font color="yellow">What do you have against my family...</font>

430
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:36,282
<font color="yellow">that you're going after all the men in my life?</font>

431
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:38,052
<font color="yellow">His death isn't on me!</font>

432
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,522
<font color="yellow">He killed himself because he couldn't handle his own emotions!</font>

433
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:44,122
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

434
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:49,052
<font color="yellow">He killed himself because he couldn't handle his own emotions?</font>

435
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:50,182
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

436
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,982
<font color="yellow">are you saying I told him to kill himself?</font>

437
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:55,322
<font color="yellow">- Is that it? - How dare you.</font>

438
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:56,982
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

439
00:26:57,522 --> 00:27:00,282
<font color="yellow">- Let's fight to the death! - Let go.</font>

440
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,152
<font color="yellow">- Get away from me. - Mum.</font>

441
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:05,552
<font color="yellow">Did you just push her?</font>

442
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,982
<font color="yellow">She started it.</font>

443
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:12,652
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

444
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,422
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let go of me.</font>

445
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:19,252
<font color="yellow">I was born on a poultry farm,</font>

446
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:21,682
<font color="yellow">and I've lived around chicken for 45 years.</font>

447
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:24,952
<font color="yellow">I know a thing or two about plucking feathers.</font>

448
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,422
<font color="yellow">I'll show you what I can do.</font>

449
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:29,022
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there.</font>

450
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:31,582
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and call the police.</font>

451
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:33,652
<font color="yellow">- Sure thing. Bye. - Let go.</font>

452
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,152
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. - Go on.</font>

453
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:38,752
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Ms Choi.</font>

454
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:42,682
<font color="yellow">How much hair should she lose to make you feel better?</font>

455
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:45,052
<font color="yellow">- Give me a number. - What for?</font>

456
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:46,522
<font color="yellow">Pull it all out.</font>

457
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:50,182
<font color="yellow">Okay. A woman who stole someone else's husband...</font>

458
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,322
<font color="yellow">needs a really good lesson.</font>

459
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:58,782
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my back.</font>

460
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,682
<font color="yellow">The phone has been turned off.</font>

461
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:13,122
<font color="yellow">- Please leave... - Why won't she pick up?</font>

462
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,422
<font color="yellow">Something bad is happening for sure.</font>

463
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:18,622
<font color="yellow">Why should she get involved in Dong Jin's business?</font>

464
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:20,982
<font color="yellow">You're early.</font>

465
00:28:21,352 --> 00:28:23,522
<font color="yellow">Did you get to Anseong and back safely?</font>

466
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:25,122
<font color="yellow">Yes, thanks to you.</font>

467
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:27,852
<font color="yellow">- Would you like some coffee? - That would be nice.</font>

468
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:30,122
<font color="yellow">- I won't be long. - Okay.</font>

469
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,052
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin? It's me, Sam Do.</font>

470
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,722
<font color="yellow">I have bad news. They heard about your divorce.</font>

471
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:43,152
<font color="yellow">Your mum, Dong Sook and my wife went to your wife's home.</font>

472
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:44,952
<font color="yellow">Divorce?</font>

473
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:00,822
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

474
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:11,482
<font color="yellow">I don't care if we were once in-laws.</font>

475
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:15,482
<font color="yellow">I'll see a doctor about my injuries and sue you.</font>

476
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:20,222
<font color="yellow">All three of you are going to jail. Look forward to that.</font>

477
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,052
<font color="yellow">They did nothing wrong.</font>

478
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:24,522
<font color="yellow">I brought them here.</font>

479
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:27,622
<font color="yellow">If you want to sue someone, sue me.</font>

480
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:30,822
<font color="yellow">You're too old to do time.</font>

481
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:35,152
<font color="yellow">I pulled out all that hair, and I tripped her up.</font>

482
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:37,052
<font color="yellow">You can sue me.</font>

483
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:41,052
<font color="yellow">You did nothing wrong. I'm the one who started it.</font>

484
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:45,152
<font color="yellow">This is all so touching.</font>

485
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:48,322
<font color="yellow">You three can all go to prison together.</font>

486
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,052
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin. - Dong Jin.</font>

487
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,852
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

488
00:29:56,652 --> 00:29:58,652
<font color="yellow">I won't let this slide.</font>

489
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:02,752
<font color="yellow">I will get Lawyer Choi to sue them all.</font>

490
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:04,682
<font color="yellow">Be prepared.</font>

491
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:19,582
<font color="yellow">She's overreacting.</font>

492
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:22,052
<font color="yellow">We didn't do that much damage.</font>

493
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:27,322
<font color="yellow">What should we do now? We made things worse for you.</font>

494
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:30,552
<font color="yellow">- I didn't think this through. - Get in the car.</font>

495
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:46,282
<font color="yellow">Don't cry, Mum. You'll make Dong Jin feel bad.</font>

496
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,852
<font color="yellow">I'm a useless mum.</font>

497
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,652
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself.</font>

498
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:54,352
<font color="yellow">It wasn't your fault.</font>

499
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,322
<font color="yellow">Are you saying it's my fault, then?</font>

500
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:02,822
<font color="yellow">You should've just scared her, not pull out a chunk of hair.</font>

501
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:05,052
<font color="yellow">She even hurt her back.</font>

502
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,352
<font color="yellow">You can't say that.</font>

503
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:10,552
<font color="yellow">You told me to pull out all her hair.</font>

504
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,422
<font color="yellow">I was angry at the time.</font>

505
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:15,152
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have taken me seriously.</font>

506
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:18,782
<font color="yellow">I spent all my energy to fight on your behalf.</font>

507
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:22,822
<font color="yellow">But instead of a thank-you, you blame me for the mess?</font>

508
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,352
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't have brought you along.</font>

509
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,382
<font color="yellow">You fought like an MMA fighter. That was so crass.</font>

510
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:31,922
<font color="yellow">- Stop saying I'm crass. - Will you two be quiet?</font>

511
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:40,022
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin's patient and thoughtful.</font>

512
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,982
<font color="yellow">If he decided to get divorced,</font>

513
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,352
<font color="yellow">it means he went through enough to justify it.</font>

514
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,282
<font color="yellow">He took as much as he could handle,</font>

515
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:55,252
<font color="yellow">and when he'd finally had enough, he gave in.</font>

516
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:58,182
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what you did?</font>

517
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:01,482
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, Mum.</font>

518
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,982
<font color="yellow">Mum, here.</font>

519
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:21,722
<font color="yellow">(Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

520
00:32:22,152 --> 00:32:24,622
<font color="yellow">If we sew it like this instead of using glue...</font>

521
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:28,152
<font color="yellow">like ready-made suits do, it fits and moves more naturally.</font>

522
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:32,022
<font color="yellow">And the suit doesn't lose its shape after time.</font>

523
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:35,052
<font color="yellow">Just like us humans, clothes also have to breathe.</font>

524
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:38,752
<font color="yellow">Doing this helps air circulate through the fabric...</font>

525
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:42,322
<font color="yellow">and makes it become more resistant to abrasion.</font>

526
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:43,822
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

527
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:47,322
<font color="yellow">A good suit has to feel three-dimensional.</font>

528
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:50,722
<font color="yellow">Using the padding stitch technique like this...</font>

529
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:52,452
<font color="yellow">adds a three-dimensional feel to the suit,</font>

530
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:55,782
<font color="yellow">which makes the lapel look and feel fuller.</font>

531
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:00,622
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

532
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:03,922
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

533
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,452
<font color="yellow">Hey, how did it go?</font>

534
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:09,322
<font color="yellow">I just dropped Mum, Dong Sook and Sun Nyeo off at our place.</font>

535
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:13,322
<font color="yellow">Let's step out for a quick chat, Sam Do.</font>

536
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:16,382
<font color="yellow">What? There are no customers right now, so we can talk here.</font>

537
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:20,322
<font color="yellow">- Let's go somewhere quiet. - All right.</font>

538
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:22,822
<font color="yellow">I'll be back shortly.</font>

539
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:23,952
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

540
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,782
<font color="yellow">Is he worried that I'd eavesdrop on their conversation?</font>

541
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,222
<font color="yellow">I have no interest in your business, okay?</font>

542
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,152
<font color="yellow">How is Ms Choi holding up?</font>

543
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:44,682
<font color="yellow">She's upset, of course.</font>

544
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:47,882
<font color="yellow">Frankly, I think about getting divorced a dozen times a day.</font>

545
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:50,182
<font color="yellow">But as you know, getting divorced isn't that simple.</font>

546
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:52,482
<font color="yellow">Consider all factors carefully.</font>

547
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:53,852
<font color="yellow">To her, I was...</font>

548
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:56,252
<font color="yellow">never really a husband.</font>

549
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,052
<font color="yellow">I think she just...</font>

550
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,922
<font color="yellow">thought of me as her guardian or butler.</font>

551
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:03,822
<font color="yellow">No, you're being too cynical. She'd never think of you as...</font>

552
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:05,322
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you all the details,</font>

553
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:07,892
<font color="yellow">but she's made me feel that way throughout our marriage.</font>

554
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:09,352
<font color="yellow">It sounds like you're exhausted.</font>

555
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,122
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

556
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:14,482
<font color="yellow">I want to be free now.</font>

557
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:17,052
<font color="yellow">I want to free myself from my greed and ambition...</font>

558
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,392
<font color="yellow">and leave her in order to find peace of mind.</font>

559
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:23,482
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

560
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,422
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

561
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,952
<font color="yellow">met up with my dad last night.</font>

562
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:31,982
<font color="yellow">You met up with Mr Lee? How?</font>

563
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,722
<font color="yellow">I managed to talk to him on the phone, and we met up.</font>

564
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:36,482
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

565
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:38,822
<font color="yellow">you should've brought him home.</font>

566
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:42,552
<font color="yellow">You know how stubborn he is. I couldn't persuade him.</font>

567
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:43,952
<font color="yellow">Then you should've called me!</font>

568
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:45,652
<font color="yellow">Is he okay?</font>

569
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,682
<font color="yellow">Please keep my illness a secret...</font>

570
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:55,252
<font color="yellow">until I come home and tell them myself.</font>

571
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:56,922
<font color="yellow">Do me a favour.</font>

572
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,852
<font color="yellow">Yes. He seemed to be doing all right.</font>

573
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:05,022
<font color="yellow">He was happy to hear about you working as a tailor again.</font>

574
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:08,452
<font color="yellow">He told me to tell you how grateful he is.</font>

575
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,982
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

576
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,352
<font color="yellow">I should've been there to see him. I'm sad I wasn't there.</font>

577
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:18,122
<font color="yellow">I was surprised because he looked so happy.</font>

578
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:21,252
<font color="yellow">I've never seen him looking that content.</font>

579
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:25,222
<font color="yellow">He said he's been wandering around and working without a proper home,</font>

580
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:29,482
<font color="yellow">so I thought he'd be extremely exhausted, but I was wrong.</font>

581
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:32,682
<font color="yellow">What exactly do suits...</font>

582
00:35:33,782 --> 00:35:34,852
<font color="yellow">mean to him?</font>

583
00:35:34,952 --> 00:35:36,122
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee...</font>

584
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:41,322
<font color="yellow">doesn't just make suits.</font>

585
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:44,122
<font color="yellow">He builds lives.</font>

586
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,222
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure how you view him, but he isn't...</font>

587
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:53,582
<font color="yellow">a mere tailor. He's a philosopher.</font>

588
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,052
<font color="yellow">That's what I think at least.</font>

589
00:35:58,452 --> 00:35:59,952
<font color="yellow">Is making suits...</font>

590
00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:04,392
<font color="yellow">that much of a grand job? You're comparing it to building lives.</font>

591
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:06,552
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I can say that it's grand,</font>

592
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,582
<font color="yellow">but the job certainly makes you happy.</font>

593
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:14,952
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to become a tailor again in my next life.</font>

594
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:20,052
<font color="yellow">If I work at the tailor shop,</font>

595
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:22,522
<font color="yellow">will I...</font>

596
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,552
<font color="yellow">also be happy?</font>

597
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,892
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, you want to work at the tailor shop?</font>

598
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:34,782
<font color="yellow">People swarmed over like bees yesterday,</font>

599
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,682
<font color="yellow">but today was pretty horrible.</font>

600
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:38,952
<font color="yellow">I didn't even make enough for a burger.</font>

601
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:41,952
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang, please do something.</font>

602
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,722
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

603
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:46,252
<font color="yellow">I've been out of that industry for over a decade.</font>

604
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:50,522
<font color="yellow">Right, so come back and work with me.</font>

605
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,452
<font color="yellow">We used to be such a great team.</font>

606
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,352
<font color="yellow">After you fell hard for that woman and ran away to the States,</font>

607
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:58,482
<font color="yellow">our agency had to pay the penalties for breaking all the contracts.</font>

608
00:36:58,582 --> 00:36:59,652
<font color="yellow">You know all that.</font>

609
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,582
<font color="yellow">How can you say that we were a great team?</font>

610
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:02,982
<font color="yellow">Back then, I was...</font>

611
00:37:03,952 --> 00:37:05,422
<font color="yellow">I was immature then.</font>

612
00:37:06,052 --> 00:37:07,552
<font color="yellow">That will never happen again.</font>

613
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:11,852
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure there are no scandals whatsoever. So please...</font>

614
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:13,982
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a call when I hear of any events you can perform at.</font>

615
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:15,052
<font color="yellow">I have to go. Bye.</font>

616
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:16,352
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang. Hey.</font>

617
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:25,222
<font color="yellow">Shall I look for a new agency?</font>

618
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,392
<font color="yellow">The job I did yesterday was sweet.</font>

619
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:28,722
<font color="yellow">What was it?</font>

620
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:30,252
<font color="yellow">What was his name?</font>

621
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:34,392
<font color="yellow">He used to be a famous singer. I went to his busking performance...</font>

622
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:37,952
<font color="yellow">and screamed and cheered for him for an hour.</font>

623
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:39,952
<font color="yellow">I got 50 dollars for it.</font>

624
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:44,122
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. That's a sweet job. - That woman...</font>

625
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:45,952
<font color="yellow">came to my performance yesterday.</font>

626
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:47,052
<font color="yellow">How was the performance?</font>

627
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,222
<font color="yellow">It was horrible.</font>

628
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:50,482
<font color="yellow">Was it that bad? What's his name?</font>

629
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:53,652
<font color="yellow">What was it?</font>

630
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,052
<font color="yellow">I think it was a two-syllable name.</font>

631
00:37:57,482 --> 00:37:58,522
<font color="yellow">Sung Jun.</font>

632
00:37:58,522 --> 00:37:59,622
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sung Jun.</font>

633
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,522
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

634
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:04,522
<font color="yellow">Who gave you that job?</font>

635
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,722
<font color="yellow">I've been neglecting my store because of Jun.</font>

636
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:11,122
<font color="yellow">I guess that's why I don't see a single soul here.</font>

637
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:14,052
<font color="yellow">Shall I run some sort of promotional events?</font>

638
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,682
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jun! What brings you here at this hour?</font>

639
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,582
<font color="yellow">Is your performance already done?</font>

640
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:24,182
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a joke?</font>

641
00:38:24,392 --> 00:38:26,422
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

642
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:29,222
<font color="yellow">I heard that you paid those people who came...</font>

643
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:31,322
<font color="yellow">to watch my performance.</font>

644
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,782
<font color="yellow">- Who said such nonsense? - I heard it...</font>

645
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:38,222
<font color="yellow">directly from one of the people you hired, so don't even try to lie.</font>

646
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,852
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm sorry, Jun.</font>

647
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:44,522
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to upset you or anything.</font>

648
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:47,682
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bear to watch you performing with no audience.</font>

649
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,752
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to cheer you up...</font>

650
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:54,452
<font color="yellow">Why do you make me feel so pathetic?</font>

651
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:57,682
<font color="yellow">Why do you feel pathetic? I wanted to encourage you.</font>

652
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:58,782
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

653
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:02,892
<font color="yellow">not pathetic enough to need your pity.</font>

654
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:04,822
<font color="yellow">This is a warning!</font>

655
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,322
<font color="yellow">Do not meddle in my business ever again.</font>

656
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:09,622
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

657
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,622
<font color="yellow">Jun, Jun!</font>

658
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:17,282
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

659
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:23,582
<font color="yellow">I knew it. I was wondering what was going on.</font>

660
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:26,252
<font color="yellow">I was a fool to let myself get all excited about it.</font>

661
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:29,392
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

662
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:31,152
<font color="yellow">Aren't you...</font>

663
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,252
<font color="yellow">Mr Sung Jun?</font>

664
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:35,552
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

665
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:44,152
<font color="yellow">I'm the executive director of Hyesung Entertainment, Oh Chang Soo.</font>

666
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:45,682
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to speak to me?</font>

667
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:48,322
<font color="yellow">Mr Oh really wanted to meet with you after hearing that you're back...</font>

668
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:52,252
<font color="yellow">in Korea now working on making a comeback.</font>

669
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:54,752
<font color="yellow">We heard that your office is in this area,</font>

670
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:57,352
<font color="yellow">so we've been looking all over for you for a few days now.</font>

671
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,182
<font color="yellow">Then are you...</font>

672
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,892
<font color="yellow">here to offer me a contract?</font>

673
00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:04,252
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

674
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,652
<font color="yellow">You took the music scene by storm as soon as you debuted 15 years ago.</font>

675
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:10,152
<font color="yellow">Then you disappeared like the wind at the peak of your prime.</font>

676
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:13,152
<font color="yellow">I was a huge fan of yours, so it utterly broke my heart.</font>

677
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:18,152
<font color="yellow">That was the biggest mistake of my life.</font>

678
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:20,622
<font color="yellow">You're back now, and you want to make a comeback.</font>

679
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,752
<font color="yellow">I have to be the one producing your new album.</font>

680
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,482
<font color="yellow">It's very nice to meet you.</font>

681
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:44,582
<font color="yellow">The payment for your student loan is overdue.</font>

682
00:40:44,682 --> 00:40:48,322
<font color="yellow">If you fail to make the payment, it could affect your credit rating.</font>

683
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:50,552
<font color="yellow">- Please make the payment soon. - It's overdue?</font>

684
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,752
<font color="yellow">Is it already past the deadline?</font>

685
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:56,982
<font color="yellow">So you'd like to see if the deadline can be extended?</font>

686
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,952
<font color="yellow">Yes. I haven't found a job yet.</font>

687
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:03,322
<font color="yellow">But I see that you've already extended it once.</font>

688
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:06,682
<font color="yellow">Only one deadline extension is allowed per person,</font>

689
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:08,352
<font color="yellow">so it cannot be extended further.</font>

690
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:10,922
<font color="yellow">I'm unable to pay the interest and the minimum payment right now.</font>

691
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:12,152
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you can do?</font>

692
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:13,252
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

693
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:27,622
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

694
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,522
<font color="yellow">You're so cold.</font>

695
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:34,452
<font color="yellow">We haven't talked in a while. Can you be a little warmer towards me?</font>

696
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:36,852
<font color="yellow">Hang up unless you have something specific to talk about.</font>

697
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,252
<font color="yellow">No! Don't hang up. I'm calling you for a reason.</font>

698
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:41,052
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - I'm off tomorrow.</font>

699
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:42,392
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the movies together.</font>

700
00:41:42,482 --> 00:41:44,582
<font color="yellow">I'll buy lunch as well as popcorn.</font>

701
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,022
<font color="yellow">I'm busy.</font>

702
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:48,322
<font color="yellow">Why are you always so busy when you don't even have a job?</font>

703
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:50,922
<font color="yellow">Unemployed people are busier than employed ones. Bye.</font>

704
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:55,782
<font color="yellow">Wait, Tae Yang. Don't hang up. Hello? Tae Yang?</font>

705
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,552
<font color="yellow">I guess he's still trying to be hard to get.</font>

706
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:02,982
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me. Did you just eavesdrop on my conversation?</font>

707
00:42:04,352 --> 00:42:05,752
<font color="yellow">It wasn't intentional.</font>

708
00:42:05,852 --> 00:42:07,952
<font color="yellow">I was walking here and overheard it.</font>

709
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:11,252
<font color="yellow">So is he still being hard to get?</font>

710
00:42:12,452 --> 00:42:13,922
<font color="yellow">He's being so difficult.</font>

711
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:17,622
<font color="yellow">Who is he? How can he treat someone like you that way?</font>

712
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:20,482
<font color="yellow">It even sounded like he's jobless right now.</font>

713
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:22,852
<font color="yellow">So many young people are unemployed these days.</font>

714
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:26,852
<font color="yellow">He's doing his best to get a job, so I'm sure he'll land one soon.</font>

715
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:28,682
<font color="yellow">Had I known that he'd stay unemployed for this long,</font>

716
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:32,152
<font color="yellow">I would've helped him when you asked me.</font>

717
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,952
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

718
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:38,222
<font color="yellow">What's the point in saying that now?</font>

719
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,652
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

720
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:42,552
<font color="yellow">How's your grandmother?</font>

721
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,782
<font color="yellow">She took some pills and is resting.</font>

722
00:42:45,182 --> 00:42:47,082
<font color="yellow">How's your mother? Did she go to the hospital?</font>

723
00:42:47,322 --> 00:42:49,152
<font color="yellow">She got checked out, but there's nothing wrong with her.</font>

724
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:50,922
<font color="yellow">She exaggerates a lot.</font>

725
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:55,022
<font color="yellow">By the way, if my sister and your uncle get a divorce,</font>

726
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,322
<font color="yellow">does that mean our friendship is over?</font>

727
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:01,952
<font color="yellow">- What friendship? - What?</font>

728
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:04,752
<font color="yellow">I thought we became really close.</font>

729
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,222
<font color="yellow">Was I wrong?</font>

730
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:09,352
<font color="yellow">I don't think we're that close,</font>

731
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:12,952
<font color="yellow">but I won't hold grudges even if they get divorced.</font>

732
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:17,022
<font color="yellow">- That's a relief. - Let's go back in now.</font>

733
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:19,522
<font color="yellow">Sit here.</font>

734
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:26,022
<font color="yellow">I told you not to take a picture since I don't have makeup on.</font>

735
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:29,052
<font color="yellow">- Why did you take a picture? - I'm sorry.</font>

736
00:43:29,452 --> 00:43:31,322
<font color="yellow">I have a friend who wants to be an announcer.</font>

737
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:33,452
<font color="yellow">You're her role model.</font>

738
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:37,222
<font color="yellow">- She wanted a picture of you. - That's none of my business.</font>

739
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:40,152
<font color="yellow">That's a violation of my portrait rights.</font>

740
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:43,822
<font color="yellow">Aren't you supposed to know that?</font>

741
00:43:44,052 --> 00:43:46,522
<font color="yellow">- She's the person who tripped me. - That's her.</font>

742
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,482
<font color="yellow">Choi Ji Yun of KBC. She's so rude.</font>

743
00:43:51,822 --> 00:43:53,422
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

744
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:55,282
<font color="yellow">It's her first day at work.</font>

745
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:59,252
<font color="yellow">She wasn't aware of our system. It was an honest mistake.</font>

746
00:43:59,622 --> 00:44:01,722
<font color="yellow">I'll knock some sense into her.</font>

747
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:03,652
<font color="yellow">That won't cut it.</font>

748
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:07,382
<font color="yellow">Who would come to this place if you invade people's privacy like this?</font>

749
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:10,482
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It won't happen again.</font>

750
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,552
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

751
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:16,252
<font color="yellow">This is common sense. This isn't some local barber shop.</font>

752
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:20,922
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

753
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:27,022
<font color="yellow">Hey, you. She says it's her first day at work.</font>

754
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:30,152
<font color="yellow">It was an honest mistake. What's the big deal?</font>

755
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:31,582
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

756
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:35,782
<font color="yellow">If you don't want people taking pictures of you, quit your job.</font>

757
00:44:36,152 --> 00:44:38,982
<font color="yellow">- Then nobody will be interested. - What did you say?</font>

758
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:42,822
<font color="yellow">You look the same with or without makeup anyway.</font>

759
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:44,682
<font color="yellow">Stop making a fuss.</font>

760
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:47,622
<font color="yellow">- Are you done talking? - Yes.</font>

761
00:44:47,982 --> 00:44:50,182
<font color="yellow">- Did you want to hear some more? - Excuse me?</font>

762
00:44:50,382 --> 00:44:53,152
<font color="yellow">- I have to shampoo my hair. - This way.</font>

763
00:44:56,182 --> 00:44:57,922
<font color="yellow">What a crazy woman.</font>

764
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:00,322
<font color="yellow">(Min Hyo Sang)</font>

765
00:45:02,382 --> 00:45:04,322
<font color="yellow">- It's me. - I'm really sorry.</font>

766
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:06,352
<font color="yellow">I can't make it tonight.</font>

767
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:08,952
<font color="yellow">Why not? Is there trouble at the office?</font>

768
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:12,652
<font color="yellow">My mum's sick. I think I should go see her.</font>

769
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:14,052
<font color="yellow">Is it serious?</font>

770
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:16,052
<font color="yellow">It's not that serious.</font>

771
00:45:16,822 --> 00:45:18,352
<font color="yellow">I think she strained her back.</font>

772
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:21,152
<font color="yellow">It's okay with me. Look after your mother.</font>

773
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:25,122
<font color="yellow">Okay, call me later.</font>

774
00:45:30,682 --> 00:45:33,482
<font color="yellow">I thought he was going to propose to me tonight.</font>

775
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:37,022
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, why is he always talking about his mum?</font>

776
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:39,752
<font color="yellow">Is he some kind of mummy's boy?</font>

777
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:45,522
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

778
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:49,382
<font color="yellow">You should go to the hospital. What are you doing here?</font>

779
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:53,482
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kim said I'll be okay if I rest for a few days.</font>

780
00:45:53,482 --> 00:45:55,182
<font color="yellow">How can Ms Choi be like that?</font>

781
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,122
<font color="yellow">She even splashed juice on you last time.</font>

782
00:45:57,482 --> 00:46:01,582
<font color="yellow">We need to teach her a lesson. Let's sue her.</font>

783
00:46:02,282 --> 00:46:05,982
<font color="yellow">We're in-laws after all. That would be too much.</font>

784
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:08,782
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo and Dong Jin are about to get a divorce. You're not in-laws.</font>

785
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:13,922
<font color="yellow">Even then, once in-laws are forever in-laws.</font>

786
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,522
<font color="yellow">You're weird.</font>

787
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:20,252
<font color="yellow">Why are you always so scared of Ms Choi?</font>

788
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,322
<font color="yellow">- What does she have on you? - There's no such thing.</font>

789
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,752
<font color="yellow">Do I look like someone who lets people do that to me?</font>

790
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,552
<font color="yellow">My back.</font>

791
00:46:30,782 --> 00:46:32,722
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head.</font>

792
00:46:39,782 --> 00:46:42,252
<font color="yellow">- They didn't call you, did they? - Who?</font>

793
00:46:42,452 --> 00:46:43,822
<font color="yellow">You know who.</font>

794
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:47,582
<font color="yellow">- I'm talking about Ms Ko. - Why?</font>

795
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:49,222
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid she might sue you?</font>

796
00:46:49,322 --> 00:46:51,382
<font color="yellow">She can't sue me.</font>

797
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:53,782
<font color="yellow">After everything she's done to me.</font>

798
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:57,182
<font color="yellow">Where is Dong Jin during all this?</font>

799
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:00,222
<font color="yellow">- Call him up. - Fine.</font>

800
00:47:06,382 --> 00:47:08,182
<font color="yellow">Hey, Dong Sook. How's Mum?</font>

801
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:11,622
<font color="yellow">What do you think? She's sick in bed.</font>

802
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:15,022
<font color="yellow">- Where are you? - I'm at a hotel.</font>

803
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:18,552
<font color="yellow">- He says he's at a hotel. - What's he doing there?</font>

804
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:19,852
<font color="yellow">Give me the phone.</font>

805
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:24,022
<font color="yellow">- It's your mother. - Hey, Mum.</font>

806
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:26,322
<font color="yellow">I was about to call you.</font>

807
00:47:26,652 --> 00:47:29,422
<font color="yellow">Why are you at a hotel when you can stay at home?</font>

808
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,722
<font color="yellow">You should come to me.</font>

809
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:36,352
<font color="yellow">I'll make doenjang jjigae, your favourite.</font>

810
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:37,782
<font color="yellow">Hurry back home.</font>

811
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:40,122
<font color="yellow">Why would you eat outside?</font>

812
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:44,552
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you saying anything?</font>

813
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:48,782
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin. - Yes, Mum. I'll be on my way.</font>

814
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:52,052
<font color="yellow">Okay, hurry back. I'll be waiting for you.</font>

815
00:47:56,782 --> 00:48:00,252
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin is better than pills. He got that headband off.</font>

816
00:48:00,452 --> 00:48:03,022
<font color="yellow">Go to the grocery store and get me some chadolbagi.</font>

817
00:48:03,222 --> 00:48:04,682
<font color="yellow">What do you need chadolbagi for?</font>

818
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,782
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin loves chadolbagi in his doenjang jjigae.</font>

819
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:12,822
<font color="yellow">Don't get frozen chadolbagi. Get the highest quality ones.</font>

820
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:21,052
<font color="yellow">Sung Jun is probably drinking by himself.</font>

821
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:26,352
<font color="yellow">- Hurry, Dong Sook. - I'm going.</font>

822
00:48:27,522 --> 00:48:29,382
<font color="yellow">The fabric is the flesh.</font>

823
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:31,682
<font color="yellow">The thread is the bone.</font>

824
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:35,922
<font color="yellow">Then if you want to make clothes that fit the body perfectly,</font>

825
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:37,882
<font color="yellow">you'll need to do a lot of needlework, right?</font>

826
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,682
<font color="yellow">- Of course. - That's why it has to be handmade.</font>

827
00:48:40,852 --> 00:48:43,452
<font color="yellow">It's called a bespoke suit. It's custom-made.</font>

828
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:47,282
<font color="yellow">It fits perfectly and feels better when you put it on.</font>

829
00:48:47,622 --> 00:48:51,352
<font color="yellow">It requires much more skills and effort than ready-made clothes.</font>

830
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:53,222
<font color="yellow">In that sense,</font>

831
00:48:53,422 --> 00:48:56,682
<font color="yellow">the handmade suits of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop...</font>

832
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:58,782
<font color="yellow">are equivalent to pure gold.</font>

833
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:01,922
<font color="yellow">It's not 14K or 18K.</font>

834
00:49:02,122 --> 00:49:03,722
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stop thinking that...</font>

835
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:06,482
<font color="yellow">your explanation is so on point.</font>

836
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:09,752
<font color="yellow">You won't get this lecture from anywhere else.</font>

837
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,382
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

838
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,882
<font color="yellow">- Welcome. - Hello.</font>

839
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,022
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

840
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:23,752
<font color="yellow">Great going.</font>

841
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:27,582
<font color="yellow">Why would you make things worse for Ms Choi and Dong Sook?</font>

842
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:33,052
<font color="yellow">She made the late chairman's wife suffer by taking her place.</font>

843
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:37,152
<font color="yellow">I had to give her a piece of my mind as a woman.</font>

844
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:41,022
<font color="yellow">What does it have to do with you whether she suffers or not?</font>

845
00:49:42,052 --> 00:49:44,352
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - You're here.</font>

846
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,752
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your forehead?</font>

847
00:49:47,982 --> 00:49:49,482
<font color="yellow">I got a minor injury.</font>

848
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:51,552
<font color="yellow">Your temper always gets you in trouble.</font>

849
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:56,182
<font color="yellow">Eun Sook's even thinking about filing a lawsuit because of you.</font>

850
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:58,052
<font color="yellow">She's just playing her cards.</font>

851
00:49:58,152 --> 00:50:01,152
<font color="yellow">- It's all bluff. - Don't talk back to me.</font>

852
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:09,752
<font color="yellow">Don't do this in front of them. This is embarrassing.</font>

853
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:12,822
<font color="yellow">I can't even be embarrassed any more.</font>

854
00:50:13,122 --> 00:50:16,122
<font color="yellow">- Take it easy. - Yes, calm down.</font>

855
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,552
<font color="yellow">Send them home.</font>

856
00:50:23,052 --> 00:50:26,482
<font color="yellow">- Good job, everyone. - We'll get going.</font>

857
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,722
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

858
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:32,522
<font color="yellow">I forgot to tell you something.</font>

859
00:50:32,882 --> 00:50:34,052
<font color="yellow">Starting next week,</font>

860
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,922
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin will start working here.</font>

861
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:38,952
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin? - Dong Jin?</font>

862
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:40,582
<font color="yellow">You can't be serious.</font>

863
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:44,222
<font color="yellow">Isn't he really smart and well-off?</font>

864
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:47,282
<font color="yellow">Why would he work at a tailor shop?</font>

865
00:50:47,822 --> 00:50:50,422
<font color="yellow">This is wrong. This can't be happening.</font>

866
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:56,482
<font color="yellow">He didn't even listen to Mr Lee when he wanted him to take over.</font>

867
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:58,582
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee isn't even here right now.</font>

868
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:01,352
<font color="yellow">Why would he start this now?</font>

869
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:04,322
<font color="yellow">This is wrong. This can't be happening.</font>

870
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:05,652
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it.</font>

871
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,982
<font color="yellow">It came as a surprise to me, too.</font>

872
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:13,822
<font color="yellow">He must have changed his mind after Mr Lee ran away from home.</font>

873
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:18,822
<font color="yellow">- He shouldn't have. - What's that?</font>

874
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,482
<font color="yellow">Never mind, it's nothing.</font>

875
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:25,422
<font color="yellow">Why does everything go so wrong?</font>

876
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,522
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's me.</font>

877
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:37,122
<font color="yellow">I knew you were cold-hearted,</font>

878
00:51:37,982 --> 00:51:39,822
<font color="yellow">but not as much as this.</font>

879
00:51:46,422 --> 00:51:50,722
<font color="yellow">How could you sign the divorce paper right away like that?</font>

880
00:51:50,922 --> 00:51:54,882
<font color="yellow">You're the one who always talked about getting a divorce.</font>

881
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:58,352
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now? Come here at once.</font>

882
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,382
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later. I'm on my way to see my mum.</font>

883
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:08,052
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's going to boss me around...</font>

884
00:52:08,382 --> 00:52:12,722
<font color="yellow">once he starts working there. What should I do?</font>

885
00:52:20,822 --> 00:52:22,052
<font color="yellow">It's a thief!</font>

886
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:30,182
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you just stop? - What?</font>

887
00:52:30,252 --> 00:52:34,052
<font color="yellow">You're selfish, but you pretend to be naive in front of others.</font>

888
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,652
<font color="yellow">You hypocrite.</font>

889
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,782
<font color="yellow">Gargoyle Eyes!</font>

890
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:38,282
<font color="yellow">Why that...</font>

891
00:52:41,152 --> 00:52:45,422
<font color="yellow">Even if I was angry, I still shouldn't have called him that.</font>

892
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:49,982
<font color="yellow">You made a big mistake, Na Yun Shil.</font>

893
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:52,052
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

894
00:52:54,482 --> 00:52:56,552
<font color="yellow">- Sir! - Help!</font>

895
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:58,352
<font color="yellow">Move!</font>

896
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:05,182
<font color="yellow">- Here! - Sir!</font>

897
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:09,722
<font color="yellow">But still, he won't be mean to his life-saver, will he?</font>

898
00:53:09,822 --> 00:53:11,022
<font color="yellow">Are you in there?</font>

899
00:53:12,652 --> 00:53:14,022
<font color="yellow">Why don't you pick up the phone?</font>

900
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:17,182
<font color="yellow">Were you going to eat ramyeon?</font>

901
00:53:18,052 --> 00:53:20,282
<font color="yellow">I was bringing you saengtae jjigae, but you didn't answer.</font>

902
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:22,852
<font color="yellow">- So I just came in. - The phone didn't ring.</font>

903
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:25,982
<font color="yellow">Oh, my bag.</font>

904
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:30,182
<font color="yellow">I must have left it at work.</font>

<font color="yellow">Please allow it, Mum.</font>

1000
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:02,852
<font color="yellow">I'm guessing you're doing this...</font>

1001
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:05,552
<font color="yellow">because you feel responsible for your dad leaving home.</font>

1002
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:07,052
<font color="yellow">But it's not your fault.</font>

1003
01:01:07,352 --> 01:01:11,152

1004
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:12,582

1007
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:19,722
<font color="yellow">I've been working non-stop for a successful career.</font>

1008
01:01:20,652 --> 01:01:21,982
<font color="yellow">But I'm a mess now.</font>

1011
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:29,982
