00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,570
<font color="yellow">It must feel refreshing yet strange to be back.</font>

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,770
<font color="yellow">I never thought I'd be back.</font>

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,130

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,430
<font color="yellow">- Submit a written explanation. - A written explanation?</font>

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,730
<font color="yellow">You didn't come to work without giving any notice and disappeared.</font>

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,170
<font color="yellow">You affected the shop's business negatively.</font>

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,370
<font color="yellow">An apology is all that is necessary. Why do I have to write such a thing?</font>

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,500
<font color="yellow">Our shop is just like any other company. I can't just let it go.</font>

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,530
<font color="yellow">Reflect on your mistake...</font>

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,570
<font color="yellow">and write it sincerely.</font>

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,330
<font color="yellow">So are you asking me to write a letter of apology now?</font>

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,970
<font color="yellow">I bet you wrote it many times in school.</font>

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,570
<font color="yellow">I was such a good student.</font>

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,170
<font color="yellow">Stop saying things that can't even be confirmed. Anyhow,</font>

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,770
<font color="yellow">I want to draw a clear line between work and personal life,</font>

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,470
<font color="yellow">so I'd like you to submit it right away.</font>

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
<font color="yellow">Welcome back, Yun Shil.</font>

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,370
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad you're back.</font>

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,300
<font color="yellow">- How are you feeling? - Good.</font>

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,870
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry to have worried you, Ms Geum.</font>

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry and grateful for everything, Master Bae.</font>

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,670
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin was so worried about you.</font>

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,700
<font color="yellow">I told her to write a written explanation.</font>

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,370
<font color="yellow">- Written explanation? - Written explanation?</font>

30
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,870
<font color="yellow">I'll reject it if I don't like it,</font>

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,470
<font color="yellow">so you better write it with all of your heart, Yun Shil.</font>

32
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,500
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,430
<font color="yellow">Did you guys go home yet?</font>

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,270
<font color="yellow">Not yet. We came here first.</font>

35
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,300
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee and Ms Choi must be waiting. You should go.</font>

36
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,270
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm really sorry for worrying you.</font>

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,730
<font color="yellow">I apologise again.</font>

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,630
<font color="yellow">I'm back, Mr Lee.</font>

39
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,670
<font color="yellow">Yes, welcome back.</font>

40
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,670
<font color="yellow">- How are you feeling? - I'm a lot better.</font>

41
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry you went through that.</font>

42
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,900
<font color="yellow">- Where's Mum? - She's making lunch.</font>

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,270
<font color="yellow">Let's go in, guys.</font>

44
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,630
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,270
<font color="yellow">My gosh, Yun Shil.</font>

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,500
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry that you had to go through that.</font>

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,700
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling all right now?</font>

48
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm fine.</font>

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,470
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin looks happy now that you're back, Yun Shil.</font>

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations, Dong Jin. - Thanks.</font>

51
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,130
<font color="yellow">My heart ached so much after you left like that.</font>

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,400
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you.</font>

53
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,470
<font color="yellow">Please don't say that, Dong Sook.</font>

54
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,200
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, I'm back.</font>

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
<font color="yellow">Welcome back. I've been waiting for you.</font>

56
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,270
<font color="yellow">- All right. Let's sit, everyone. - Okay.</font>

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,700
<font color="yellow">Mum has been cooking up a storm for you since this morning.</font>

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,130
<font color="yellow">Eating and sleeping well is the best remedy.</font>

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,000
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about anything and get as much rest as you can.</font>

60
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,230
<font color="yellow">I will, Ms Choi.</font>

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,930
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's eat, everyone.</font>

62
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,400
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,530
<font color="yellow">Mum made napa cabbage pancakes which you love.</font>

64
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,970
<font color="yellow">- Eat it while it's still hot. - Okay. Thank you.</font>

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,630
<font color="yellow">Try the deep-fried smelts, too.</font>

66
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,800
<font color="yellow">I went fishing and caught them myself.</font>

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,800
<font color="yellow">You went there to make money but came back...</font>

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
<font color="yellow">with smelts instead of money.</font>

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,100
<font color="yellow">You performed on "Music Stage",</font>

70
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,000
<font color="yellow">so I thought you'd make it big soon.</font>

71
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,670
<font color="yellow">When will you start earning an income?</font>

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,170
<font color="yellow">His song is getting good feedback, so it'll become a big hit soon.</font>

73
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,600
<font color="yellow">Look forward to it.</font>

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,470
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,770
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. - You should eat more.</font>

76
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,400
<font color="yellow">You didn't even have a proper breakfast.</font>

77
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,100
<font color="yellow">You two are wearing matching rings.</font>

78
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,030
<font color="yellow">Are you guys getting married? When?</font>

79
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,070
<font color="yellow">I thought Mother approved of it.</font>

80
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,670
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you decided to come back, Yun Shil?</font>

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
<font color="yellow">My back is killing me. I should go lie down.</font>

82
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,200
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, eat up.</font>

83
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,930
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

84
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,570
<font color="yellow">Why did you follow me?</font>

85
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,170
<font color="yellow">I want to tell you something.</font>

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

87
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,200
<font color="yellow">We want to get married. Please give us permission.</font>

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,270
<font color="yellow">Do you have to rush it like that?</font>

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,070
<font color="yellow">I'm not against it.</font>

90
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,330
<font color="yellow">It's just that it's the most important decision in life.</font>

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,800
<font color="yellow">I think you should take more time and think about it carefully.</font>

92
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,030
<font color="yellow">I feel like something else...</font>

93
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,700
<font color="yellow">will get in the way if we don't do it now.</font>

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,930
<font color="yellow">Hardships won't deflect just because you guys are married.</font>

95
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,970
<font color="yellow">From that woman who claims to be Yun Shil's mother-in-law...</font>

96
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,370
<font color="yellow">to the jerk who will show up saying that he's her husband,</font>

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,130
<font color="yellow">you'll have to put up with everything.</font>

98
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,530
<font color="yellow">If you're not confident about overcoming it all,</font>

99
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,530
<font color="yellow">don't even start.</font>

100
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,700
<font color="yellow">I will not avoid anything. I'm confident, Mum.</font>

101
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,000
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

102
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,300
<font color="yellow">I haven't completely made up my mind yet,</font>

103
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,970
<font color="yellow">so just give me a little bit of time to think.</font>

104
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,430
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

105
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

106
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,270
<font color="yellow">The housekeeper...</font>

107
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,700
<font color="yellow">made the porridge with pine nuts which you love.</font>

108
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,170
<font color="yellow">You should eat this, Mum.</font>

109
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,930
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me right now?</font>

110
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,670
<font color="yellow">Before I could even get out of the shock from you being pregnant,</font>

111
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,130
<font color="yellow">you told me that it was all a lie.</font>

112
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,100
<font color="yellow">Tell me. How long were you planning on fooling me?</font>

113
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,200
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you the truth...</font>

114
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,270
<font color="yellow">after we get married.</font>

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,800
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you fool.</font>

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,700
<font color="yellow">Madam Ko, I'm here.</font>

117
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,970
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why is Pooper here again?</font>

118
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,900
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

119
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

120
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,930
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang told me that you're unwell.</font>

121
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,730
<font color="yellow">I came to see you because I was worried.</font>

122
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,930
<font color="yellow">I see. Thanks for coming.</font>

123
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,930
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

124
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,430
<font color="yellow">Eat this, Mum.</font>

125
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,700
<font color="yellow">You must be so upset.</font>

126
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,270
<font color="yellow">You probably coddled Hyo Won a lot because she's the youngest.</font>

127
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,570
<font color="yellow">That's why she doesn't know how the world works.</font>

128
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,100
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

129
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,670
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

130
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,600
<font color="yellow">being out of touch with reality isn't good.</font>

131
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should make her expand the range...</font>

132
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,030
<font color="yellow">of people she hangs out with and meet more guys?</font>

133
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,230
<font color="yellow">You are right.</font>

134
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,500
<font color="yellow">She's still so young, yet she's not even going to work.</font>

135
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,570
<font color="yellow">All she does is obsessing over her boyfriend.</font>

136
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,170
<font color="yellow">She's being so anti-social and ineffective.</font>

137
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,530
<font color="yellow">Are you criticising my daughter right now?</font>

138
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,030
<font color="yellow">No, that's not what I meant.</font>

139
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,570
<font color="yellow">Do you not respect your future in-laws?</font>

140
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,270
<font color="yellow">How dare you badmouth your future sister-in-law?</font>

141
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,100
<font color="yellow">I wasn't badmouthing her. I'm just worried about her.</font>

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

143
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to say this to you, but...</font>

144
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,670
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,570
<font color="yellow">You should know the reality of marriage.</font>

146
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,530
<font color="yellow">You grew up without any hardships.</font>

147
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,830
<font color="yellow">I can't understand why you want to marry a guy like Tae Yang.</font>

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,900
<font color="yellow">Then don't try to understand.</font>

149
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,370
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to be understood by someone like you.</font>

150
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,670
<font color="yellow">Someone like me?</font>

151
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,500
<font color="yellow">You betrayed Tae Yang...</font>

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,300
<font color="yellow">and chose another guy because Tae Yang is not rich.</font>

153
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,600
<font color="yellow">No wonder you can't understand me.</font>

154
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,530
<font color="yellow">What did you just say? Don't you think you're out of line?</font>

155
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,230
<font color="yellow">There was a materialistic aspect. That I'm not going to deny.</font>

156
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,900
<font color="yellow">But essentially, what I hated more about him...</font>

157
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,130
<font color="yellow">was how he had no ambition or dream.</font>

158
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,070
<font color="yellow">That's why I was attracted to Hyo Sang who is the exact opposite.</font>

159
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,530
<font color="yellow">I guess you can say that he's chilled if you want to sugarcoat it.</font>

160
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,670
<font color="yellow">But to me, it just looked like he was trying...</font>

161
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,670
<font color="yellow">to look chilled when he's actually lazy and incompetent.</font>

162
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,870
<font color="yellow">He chose to postpone his dreams in order to help...</font>

163
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,000
<font color="yellow">and take care of his girlfriend who was poor.</font>

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,730
<font color="yellow">How can you call someone like that lazy and incompetent?</font>

165
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,970
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be thanking him?</font>

166
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,570
<font color="yellow">I already repaid him for everything he did for me, so I'm not indebted.</font>

167
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,670
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

168
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,270
<font color="yellow">Don't just try to see the good sides.</font>

169
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,630
<font color="yellow">Look at the situation objectively and carefully.</font>

170
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,170
<font color="yellow">Is Tae Yang living like that because he's chilled and down-to-earth?</font>

171
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,340
<font color="yellow">Or is he trying to justify the fact that he's a lazy loser?</font>

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

173
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,000
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to avenge Tae Yang.</font>

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,700
<font color="yellow">- What did you just say? - Also,</font>

175
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,970
<font color="yellow">you can't use the word "loser" to describe anyone and everyone.</font>

176
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,700
<font color="yellow">It should only be used to refer to someone like you...</font>

177
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,770
<font color="yellow">who chooses money over love.</font>

178
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,670
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

179
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, Tae Yang.</font>

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,030
<font color="yellow">Did I catch you at a bad time?</font>

181
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,630
<font color="yellow">No. I just got home. I'm writing a written explanation now.</font>

182
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't visit you at the hospital.</font>

183
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,030
<font color="yellow">What's that written explanation for?</font>

184
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,270
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee asked me to submit it.</font>

185
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,800
<font color="yellow">I must say that you're at fault this time.</font>

186
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,030
<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

187
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm regretting what I did.</font>

188
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,100
<font color="yellow">I've decided to stay strong...</font>

189
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,770
<font color="yellow">and not get swayed by little things.</font>

190
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,630
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm fine now.</font>

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's talk again soon.</font>

192
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,700
<font color="yellow">(I sincerely apologise. Also, I didn't mean it when Mr Lee...)</font>

193
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,170
<font color="yellow">I'm coming in.</font>

194
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,630
<font color="yellow">Did you finish writing it?</font>

195
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,130
<font color="yellow">Do I really have to write it?</font>

196
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,470
<font color="yellow">I told you. We have to draw a clear line between work and personal life.</font>

197
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,170
<font color="yellow">Okay. All right.</font>

198
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,900
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

199
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,630
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's see.</font>

200
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,170
<font color="yellow">"Written Explanation".</font>

201
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,070
<font color="yellow">"I missed work for 2 weeks without notice in January 2017..."</font>

202
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,870
<font color="yellow">"and ended up negatively affecting the shop's business."</font>

203
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,170
<font color="yellow">"Then I ran away like a coward..."</font>

204
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,100
<font color="yellow">"and distressed Mr Lee Dong Jin."</font>

205
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,370
<font color="yellow">"I sincerely apologise for what I have done."</font>

206
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,430
<font color="yellow">"Also, I hurt Mr Lee's feelings by telling him to leave me alone..."</font>

207
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,470
<font color="yellow">"when he found me, but I didn't actually mean it."</font>

208
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,030
<font color="yellow">"My heart broke as I was uttering those words."</font>

209
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you reading it aloud like that?</font>

210
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,430
<font color="yellow">You wrote a love letter instead of a written explanation.</font>

211
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,000
<font color="yellow">"Mr Lee always takes such good care of me and gives me so much love."</font>

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,470
<font color="yellow">"I'll be sure to keep all of the promises I made..."</font>

213
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,870
<font color="yellow">"so that I never hurt his feelings or break his heart again."</font>

214
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,400
<font color="yellow">"In addition, I'll love..."</font>

215
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,030
<font color="yellow">"and care for him more from now on."</font>

216
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,430
<font color="yellow">You kill me.</font>

217
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,230
<font color="yellow">This is the sweetest and most memorable written explanation.</font>

218
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,730
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Something is missing.</font>

219
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,670
<font color="yellow">You didn't sign it.</font>

220
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,200
<font color="yellow">- Do I have to sign it? - Of course.</font>

221
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,000
<font color="yellow">That kiss will serve as your signature.</font>

222
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,670
<font color="yellow">Please don't be like this all the time.</font>

223
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,900
<font color="yellow">We live with your parents, you know.</font>

224
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,830
<font color="yellow">I know you like it. Don't be all coy.</font>

225
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,070
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

226
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,030
<font color="yellow">You still have a mild fever.</font>

227
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,400
<font color="yellow">I'm fine now.</font>

228
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,330
<font color="yellow">You still can't overexert yourself, okay?</font>

229
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,730
<font color="yellow">I have to head out now for a meeting. Get some rest.</font>

230
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,400
<font color="yellow">- Why are you following me? - I want to see you out.</font>

231
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,270
<font color="yellow">My gosh, I'm honoured.</font>

232
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,330
<font color="yellow">Good. I really like this.</font>

233
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,270
<font color="yellow">Young Eun, what brings you here?</font>

234
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,530
<font color="yellow">You were home.</font>

235
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,530
<font color="yellow">Thanks so much for dinner yesterday.</font>

236
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,000
<font color="yellow">I brought the sweet potato cake you like. Try it.</font>

237
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,500
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to bring anything.</font>

238
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
<font color="yellow">Have a seat for a cup of tea.</font>

239
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,700
<font color="yellow">Someone's watching the store for me, so I have to go back quickly.</font>

240
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,670
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you feeling sick? You look pale.</font>

241
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,600
<font color="yellow">My head is pounding a little.</font>

242
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
<font color="yellow">You've been talking about your headache for a while.</font>

243
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,600
<font color="yellow">You should go see a doctor.</font>

244
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,700
<font color="yellow">It's nothing serious. Don't worry.</font>

245
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,370
<font color="yellow">I should go lie down. Get back safely.</font>

246
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,870
<font color="yellow">Thanks for this.</font>

247
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,430
<font color="yellow">My gosh, Sun Nyeo. Are you all right?</font>

248
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,570
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

249
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,970
<font color="yellow">I was just dizzy for a few seconds. I'm really okay.</font>

250
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,230
<font color="yellow">(Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

251
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,230
<font color="yellow">Hey, Young Eun.</font>

252
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,430
<font color="yellow">What brings you here at this hour?</font>

253
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,670
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you about Sun Nyeo.</font>

254
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,030
<font color="yellow">- My wife? - I think she's ill.</font>

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,770
<font color="yellow">She's ill? How?</font>

256
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,530
<font color="yellow">I'm not too sure,</font>

257
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,830
<font color="yellow">but she has been looking unwell for a while.</font>

258
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,330
<font color="yellow">Take her to a doctor.</font>

259
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. I mean, Wolgyesu...</font>

260
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,470
<font color="yellow">cannot just be a branch office of Tonelli...</font>

261
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,370
<font color="yellow">but an active cooperative partner.</font>

262
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, I agree. Wolgyesu's production system...</font>

263
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,870
<font color="yellow">and Tonelli's technical certification...</font>

264
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,700
<font color="yellow">will be a great collaboration.</font>

265
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,100
<font color="yellow">It'll certainly lessen the burden on our side.</font>

266
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,730
<font color="yellow">It's much more efficient to have Wolgyesu manage production...</font>

267
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,600
<font color="yellow">than to station the technical director...</font>

268
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,070
<font color="yellow">from the Tonelli headquarters.</font>

269
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,900
<font color="yellow">But how will the master tailor handle all those orders?</font>

270
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,970
<font color="yellow">We have many skilled craftsmen in Korea.</font>

271
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,970
<font color="yellow">So I'm thinking of establishing a co-operation...</font>

272
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,700
<font color="yellow">by getting together those craftsmen.</font>

273
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,470
<font color="yellow">You mean, when all the orders are received,</font>

274
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,530
<font color="yellow">each master will be responsible for production?</font>

275
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

276
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,900
<font color="yellow">Can you provide Tonelli with videos of the production process?</font>

277
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
<font color="yellow">That's exactly what I was thinking.</font>

278
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,530
<font color="yellow">That will enable the company to collect a comprehensive database...</font>

279
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,100
<font color="yellow">of Asian body types and preferences.</font>

280
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,130
<font color="yellow">My company will love it.</font>

281
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,700
<font color="yellow">And it'll be a true collaboration.</font>

282
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,530
<font color="yellow">Gianni, I think we have a great chemistry.</font>

283
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,670
<font color="yellow">I think so, too.</font>

284
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="yellow">Mr Moravia met with Mr Lee.</font>

285
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,230
<font color="yellow">Gianni met up with Dong Jin? For what?</font>

286
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,130
<font color="yellow">I think they talked about opening a store.</font>

287
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,930
<font color="yellow">That is crazy. People at Tonelli think so highly of the company.</font>

288
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,900
<font color="yellow">Why would they want to open a store with him?</font>

289
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,770
<font color="yellow">Are you saying they talked about opening their first store in Asia?</font>

290
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,970
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

291
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,170
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee has been discussing it with Tonelli...</font>

292
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,500
<font color="yellow">since he used to work here at Meesa Apparel,</font>

293
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,530
<font color="yellow">so they could trust him.</font>

294
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
<font color="yellow">Then come up with a solution.</font>

295
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,600
<font color="yellow">No. First, find out whether it's really true or not.</font>

296
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,900
<font color="yellow">- There's no way it's true. - Yes, Sir.</font>

297
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,330
<font color="yellow">And call an emergency executives' meeting when you're ready.</font>

298
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

299
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,130
<font color="yellow">It's never-ending. I'm seriously going crazy.</font>

300
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,170
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

301
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,200
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

302
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,830
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so upset? What happened?</font>

303
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,600
<font color="yellow">It's about Hyo Won.</font>

304
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,800
<font color="yellow">What about her? Did she cause trouble again?</font>

305
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,570
<font color="yellow">I stopped by to see your mum...</font>

306
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,670
<font color="yellow">and gave her advice about Tae Yang because I was worried about her.</font>

307
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,530
<font color="yellow">Then she dumped water on my face all of a sudden.</font>

308
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,030
<font color="yellow">What? Has she lost her mind or what?</font>

309
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,930
<font color="yellow">I shall teach that girl a lesson.</font>

310
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,630
<font color="yellow">Calm down. If you call her now,</font>

311
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,270
<font color="yellow">it'll just look like I caused a fight between you two.</font>

312
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
<font color="yellow">What did you tell her...</font>

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
<font color="yellow">to make her dump water on you?</font>

314
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,670
<font color="yellow">I said that I broke up with Tae Yang not because he's poor...</font>

315
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,670
<font color="yellow">but because he looked like a lazy loser compared to you.</font>

316
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,530
<font color="yellow">She dumped water on me as soon as I said it.</font>

317
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,770
<font color="yellow">Everything you said is true.</font>

318
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,600
<font color="yellow">It was hard for me to bring it up to her.</font>

319
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,270
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,100
<font color="yellow">That lame idiot from who knows where...</font>

321
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,930
<font color="yellow">is ruining my family.</font>

322
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,700
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mum. What's up?</font>

323
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,270
<font color="yellow">You mean now?</font>

324
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,400
<font color="yellow">All right. I see.</font>

325
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,400
<font color="yellow">What does Mother say?</font>

326
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,270
<font color="yellow">She told us to come home now.</font>

327
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

328
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,600
<font color="yellow">What's the urgent matter you want to discuss, Mum?</font>

329
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,200
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Sang and Choi Ji Yun...</font>

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,270
<font color="yellow">can have a wedding this month...</font>

331
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,000
<font color="yellow">as planned.</font>

332
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,400
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

333
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,100
<font color="yellow">And about Min Hyo Won and Kang Tae Yang,</font>

334
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,330
<font color="yellow">we'll discuss later. That's all for today.</font>

335
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,200
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

336
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,540
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Mum everything.</font>

337
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,040
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Won, are you out of your mind?</font>

338
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,670
<font color="yellow">Mum should know...</font>

339
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,370
<font color="yellow">what kind of woman Choi Ji Yun is.</font>

340
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,570
<font color="yellow">What kind of woman am I?</font>

341
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,040
<font color="yellow">You left your poor boyfriend...</font>

342
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,270
<font color="yellow">and chose a rich man to change your life.</font>

343
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,870
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won. - Am I wrong?</font>

344
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,730
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking? Let's say...</font>

345
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,670
<font color="yellow">Mum finds out the truth. Do you think she will reject only Ji Yun?</font>

346
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,040
<font color="yellow">She will also reject Kang Tae Yang right away.</font>

347
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,470
<font color="yellow">I suggest...</font>

348
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,570
<font color="yellow">we make a gentleman's agreement.</font>

349
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,130
<font color="yellow">- A gentleman's agreement? - A gentleman's agreement?</font>

350
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,730
<font color="yellow">If you promise...</font>

351
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,040
<font color="yellow">you won't sabotage our marriage,</font>

352
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,270
<font color="yellow">we'll agree to your dating, too. Do you understand?</font>

353
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,670
<font color="yellow">Deal.</font>

354
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,470
<font color="yellow">I feel like we're fooled.</font>

355
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,370
<font color="yellow">Let's wish them happiness.</font>

356
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,470
<font color="yellow">That would bring us good luck.</font>

357
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,800
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

358
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,170
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

359
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,170
<font color="yellow">are you all right?</font>

360
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,370
<font color="yellow">Will you be all right...</font>

361
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
<font color="yellow">if Choi Ji Yun and you become family?</font>

362
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,130
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have dated you if it mattered to me.</font>

363
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,970
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

364
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,970
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

365
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,540
<font color="yellow">There's no problem, then.</font>

366
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,730
<font color="yellow">Let's do tarot card readings.</font>

367
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,570
<font color="yellow">Why would we do that?</font>

368
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,300
<font color="yellow">I feel restless.</font>

369
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,040
<font color="yellow">Let's do it just for fun. Can't we?</font>

370
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,540
<font color="yellow">I have a CF shooting later today.</font>

371
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,570
<font color="yellow">It won't take long.</font>

372
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,040
<font color="yellow">Let's go in now.</font>

373
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,770
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

374
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,200
<font color="yellow">It's nice here, isn't it?</font>

375
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,330
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

376
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,770
<font color="yellow">I don't see anyone waiting.</font>

377
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,370
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - How are you?</font>

378
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,830
<font color="yellow">He looks familiar.</font>

379
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,570
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

380
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,040
<font color="yellow">Have you ever tried it before?</font>

381
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,230
<font color="yellow">- No. - You haven't.</font>

382
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,570
<font color="yellow">First, it's important to open your minds...</font>

383
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,670
<font color="yellow">so that I can read your fortune.</font>

384
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,130
<font color="yellow">You have to believe in supernatural phenomena.</font>

385
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,430
<font color="yellow">For example,</font>

386
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,400
<font color="yellow">let me borrow your coffee.</font>

387
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,770
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - It's amazing.</font>

388
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,540
<font color="yellow">Well, something like this.</font>

389
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,130
<font color="yellow">You can drink it.</font>

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
<font color="yellow">It's water.</font>

391
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,970
<font color="yellow">Let's start fortune telling now.</font>

392
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,800
<font color="yellow">It's amazing.</font>

393
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,730
<font color="yellow">Now, lady should...</font>

394
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,100
<font color="yellow">think of your boyfriend...</font>

395
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,430
<font color="yellow">and carefully pick three cards.</font>

396
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,500
<font color="yellow">Do it carefully.</font>

397
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,600
<font color="yellow">- You have to be careful. - Goodness.</font>

398
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,000
<font color="yellow">You have to pick the right card.</font>

399
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,040
<font color="yellow">Think about your lover sincerely and pick the right card.</font>

400
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,800
<font color="yellow">I can feel the energy.</font>

401
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,470
<font color="yellow">This is the last card.</font>

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,040
<font color="yellow">This one?</font>

403
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
<font color="yellow">This one.</font>

404
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,070
<font color="yellow">You picked three cards.</font>

405
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,600
<font color="yellow">Let's see. The first card.</font>

406
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,430
<font color="yellow">- It's the lover. - The lover.</font>

407
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,600
<font color="yellow">Well, it's the lover card,</font>

408
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,730
<font color="yellow">but there's a problem.</font>

409
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,430
<font color="yellow">If the card was put towards you,</font>

410
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,570
<font color="yellow">it could have been a good card.</font>

411
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,570
<font color="yellow">However, it's put against you.</font>

412
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
<font color="yellow">This card means...</font>

413
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,170
<font color="yellow">your relationship is good currently,</font>

414
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,830
<font color="yellow">but in the near future...</font>

415
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,270
<font color="yellow">you might not be together,</font>

416
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,770
<font color="yellow">- as I interpret. - You're a total swindler.</font>

417
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,370
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - It won't happen to us.</font>

418
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,170
<font color="yellow">We can't break up.</font>

419
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,400
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

420
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,070
<font color="yellow">Let's see the second card.</font>

421
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,670
<font color="yellow">What is it? It looks like a very bad one.</font>

422
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,170
<font color="yellow">It's a tower card.</font>

423
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,700
<font color="yellow">Even though it doesn't look good,</font>

424
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,270
<font color="yellow">it would have been bad if it was put towards you.</font>

425
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,400
<font color="yellow">However, it was put against you.</font>

426
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,370
<font color="yellow">So, this card means...</font>

427
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,530
<font color="yellow">in the near future,</font>

428
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,200
<font color="yellow">a serious trouble can happen to you,</font>

429
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,470
<font color="yellow">but if you overcome it together,</font>

430
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,800
<font color="yellow">it would cement your relationship.</font>

431
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,470
<font color="yellow">So, it's a very good card.</font>

432
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,100
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry. - What a relief.</font>

433
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,530
<font color="yellow">Let's see the last card.</font>

434
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,900
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's your card.</font>

435
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
<font color="yellow">The sun. Is it a good card?</font>

436
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,070
<font color="yellow">Right. It's a happy ending.</font>

437
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure whether I should tell you this,</font>

438
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,130
<font color="yellow">but I guess you would make a baby before you get married.</font>

439
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,400
<font color="yellow">- That would never happen. - You're so sure of it.</font>

440
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,130
<font color="yellow">All right. Let me explain it.</font>

441
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,470
<font color="yellow">This card means a good result...</font>

442
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,770
<font color="yellow">after a severe hardship.</font>

443
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,200
<font color="yellow">From my experience,</font>

444
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,330
<font color="yellow">a lot of soon-to-be married couples...</font>

445
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,570
<font color="yellow">who made a baby before the wedding have picked this card.</font>

446
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,730
<font color="yellow">If that's not the case,</font>

447
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,130
<font color="yellow">you can pass an important exam,</font>

448
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,970
<font color="yellow">or you can...</font>

449
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,070
<font color="yellow">- unexpectedly make a big fortune. - That's amazing.</font>

450
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,800
<font color="yellow">This card can mean those things.</font>

451
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
<font color="yellow">He's excellent.</font>

452
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,700
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, I think you'll pass the exam.</font>

453
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,130
<font color="yellow">- I hope so. - You're excellent.</font>

454
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,370
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it means a great luck, right?</font>

455
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,930
<font color="yellow">Something good will happen soon.</font>

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,470
<font color="yellow">He's excellent.</font>

457
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,270
<font color="yellow">My name is Hyun Woo.</font>

458
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,900
<font color="yellow">I guess I've heard of him.</font>

459
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,770
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

460
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,930
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

461
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,100
<font color="yellow">- Mum, I'm home. - All right.</font>

462
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
<font color="yellow">- Have you had dinner? - Not yet.</font>

463
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,570
<font color="yellow">I'll set the table. Wash your hands and come.</font>

464
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,870
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil will set the table. You can rest, Mum.</font>

465
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,270
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious. Thank you.</font>

466
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,170
<font color="yellow">How was your business?</font>

467
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,800
<font color="yellow">I think something good will happen soon.</font>

468
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,470
<font color="yellow">- You can count on it. - Are you sure?</font>

469
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,930
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

470
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,070
<font color="yellow">You're so amazing, Dong Jin.</font>

471
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,200
<font color="yellow">I know I'm good at work,</font>

472
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,430
<font color="yellow">but I guess it's thanks to "Na Yun Shil effect" this time.</font>

473
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,030
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

474
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,200
<font color="yellow">It's because you're good at what you do.</font>

475
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,370
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the dinner.</font>

476
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,530
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - I bit a fishbone.</font>

477
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Spit it out.</font>

478
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,500
<font color="yellow">It's a small one. I'm fine.</font>

479
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,870
<font color="yellow">You're not good at boning fish.</font>

480
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,470
<font color="yellow">You tend to be careless sometimes.</font>

481
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,600
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

482
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,070
<font color="yellow">Can't you say thanks to someone who prepared your dinner?</font>

483
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,330
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

484
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,330
<font color="yellow">I had a meeting for two hours...</font>

485
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,670
<font color="yellow">in English with that Gianni guy.</font>

486
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,470
<font color="yellow">I'm too tired to hold my spoon. You should feed me.</font>

487

<font color="yellow">You give a patient too much work!</font>

488
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,470
<font color="yellow">I want that one.</font>

489
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

490
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,070
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

491
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,100
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time since he smiled like that.</font>

492
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,200
<font color="yellow">He looks so happy.</font>

493
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,600
<font color="yellow">I heard that you came back.</font>

494
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,100
<font color="yellow">- Do you feel better now? - Yes, I feel much better.</font>

495
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
<font color="yellow">Are you all right? You don't look good.</font>

496
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,470
<font color="yellow">Life is short.</font>

497
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
<font color="yellow">Don't care about others.</font>

498
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,800
<font color="yellow">Do what you want to do.</font>

499
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,730
<font color="yellow">Everything is futile at the end.</font>

500
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,830
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

501
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,470
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

502
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,970
<font color="yellow">I told you that since you're like my own sister.</font>

503
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't visit you in the hospital. Buy some fruit with that.</font>

504
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,930
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine. - Receive it when I can give it.</font>

505
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,130
<font color="yellow">I won't see you for long anyway.</font>

506
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,970
<font color="yellow">She won't see me for long?</font>

507
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,770
<font color="yellow">Is she going somewhere?</font>

508
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,200
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - I hope you enjoy it.</font>

509
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,230
<font color="yellow">Look at this octopus and abalone.</font>

510
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
<font color="yellow">I should eat this drumstick.</font>

512
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,870
<font color="yellow">Can't you offer me first if you think it looks that great?</font>

513
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,300
<font color="yellow">All you think about is yourself.</font>

514
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,900
<font color="yellow">You prefer chicken breast over drumsticks.</font>

515
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you fool. I only said that to give you drumsticks.</font>

516
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,470
<font color="yellow">Why would I like chicken breast which is so dry?</font>

517
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,800
<font color="yellow">Then you should have just told me. You can eat this drumstick.</font>

518
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,570
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

519
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,300

520
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,530
<font color="yellow">People are looking at us. What's the matter?</font>

521
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,130
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

522
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,370
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll stop crying.</font>

526
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,330

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,370
<font color="yellow">I've been watching you for the last few days,</font>

534

<font color="yellow">That's what it is, right?</font>

541
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,330
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

542
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,070
<font color="yellow">Why did you rip it up?</font>

543
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,500
<font color="yellow">I can't divorce you because I don't want the universe to punish me...</font>

00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,870
<font color="yellow">It's also for my memorial service, so please make sure it looks good.</font>

571
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,370
<font color="yellow">I guess you're very ill.</font>

<font color="yellow">Please smile again. I'll take another shot.</font>

586
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,730
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

587
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,470
<font color="yellow">Do you want to do it some other time?</font>

588
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,770
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, but could you please give me some time alone?</font>

589
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,800
<font color="yellow">Sure, no problem.</font>

590
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,500
<font color="yellow">I'm still young.</font>

591
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,900
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I have to take a photo for my funeral at this age.</font>

592
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,900
<font color="yellow">What kind of cursed fate is this?</font>

593
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,230
<font color="yellow">The more I think about it, the more upset I get.</font>

594

<font color="yellow">Mum...</font>

598
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
<font color="yellow">Would you like to come back another time?</font>

599
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,870
<font color="yellow">No, I want to do it now.</font>

600
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,600
<font color="yellow">All right. Here we go.</font>

601
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,570
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Sam Do!</font>

602
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,330

<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me...</font>

606
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,870

<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that you still think so highly of Dong Jin,</font>

609
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,800
<font color="yellow">but I think the flame that you two had...</font>

610
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,870
<font color="yellow">burned out long ago.</font>

611
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,230
<font color="yellow">I would like it if you gave up.</font>

612
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,900
<font color="yellow">Don't beg to make the impossible possible.</font>

613
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
<font color="yellow">Those two haven't changed one bit.</font>

614
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

615
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,370
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Mr Lee Man Sool's residence?</font>

616
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,100
<font color="yellow">It is. Who is this?</font>

617
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,970
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

618
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,830
<font color="yellow">Are you Ms Na by any chance?</font>

619
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Na Yun Shil.</font>

620
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,300
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

621
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,200
<font color="yellow">I'm Dong Jin's ex-wife. What are you doing there?</font>

622
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,800
<font color="yellow">I thought you were at a hospital.</font>

623
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,000
<font color="yellow">I got discharged and came home today.</font>

624
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,870
<font color="yellow">I thought your injury was serious. I guess that wasn't the case.</font>

625
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,400
<font color="yellow">Anyway, let's meet. I'll go to that area now.</font>

626
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,300
<font color="yellow">- For what? - For what?</font>

627
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,900
<font color="yellow">Just do as I say. Why are you so full of questions?</font>

628
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,700
<font color="yellow">I'll go to your place if you don't show up, so just come meet me.</font>

629
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,970
<font color="yellow">I heard that you got injured, but you look totally fine.</font>

630
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,330
<font color="yellow">You put on a show and acted like you were leaving to worry the elders.</font>

631
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,770
<font color="yellow">Then you acted like a patient to win Dong Jin's heart.</font>

632
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,500
<font color="yellow">You don't even know anything. Watch what you say.</font>

633
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,330
<font color="yellow">I hate repeating myself.</font>

634
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,130
<font color="yellow">Stop using his sympathy...</font>

635
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,100
<font color="yellow">to cling to him.</font>

636
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
<font color="yellow">Leave him right now.</font>

637
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,500
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

638
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,030
<font color="yellow">- What? - He doesn't want me to leave him.</font>

639
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,000
<font color="yellow">I don't want to leave him, either.</font>

640
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,770
<font color="yellow">That's why I can't leave him.</font>

641
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,700
<font color="yellow">I'll make it easier for you to understand.</font>

642
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,830
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin belongs in a big world with me.</font>

643
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,170
<font color="yellow">He isn't someone who should rot in a tiny tailor shop with you.</font>

644
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,700
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's what he wants?</font>

645
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,300
<font color="yellow">He might want to leave the store...</font>

646
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,730
<font color="yellow">to do much more in the wide world,</font>

647
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,170
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't want to do any of it with you.</font>

648
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,530
<font color="yellow">I think you're still recovering from the accident.</font>

649
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,170
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin and I...</font>

650
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,770
<font color="yellow">overcame a tough time together.</font>

651
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,300
<font color="yellow">We promised never to break up again.</font>

652
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,600
<font color="yellow">You're too shameless.</font>

653
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,800
<font color="yellow">You have a husband in prison.</font>

654
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,970
<font color="yellow">You might want to use Gi Pyo...</font>

655
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,600
<font color="yellow">to force me to leave Dong Jin.</font>

656
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,600
<font color="yellow">Give up.</font>

657
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,030
<font color="yellow">As you already know,</font>

658
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,530
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo and I have no legal obligations to each other.</font>

659
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,170
<font color="yellow">Just like you and Dong Jin.</font>

660
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,330
<font color="yellow">This is the last time I hold back.</font>

661
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,400
<font color="yellow">I hope we never meet again.</font>

662
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,600
<font color="yellow">How dare she?</font>

663
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,770
<font color="yellow">(Mr Pretty Eyes)</font>

664
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,570
<font color="yellow">(Mr Pretty Eyes)</font>

665
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
<font color="yellow">Hi, Dong Jin.</font>

666
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,200
<font color="yellow">Where are you? You left without a word.</font>

667
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,670
<font color="yellow">I came out to get something.</font>

668
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,070
<font color="yellow">- What? - Dressing for my burns.</font>

669
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,940
<font color="yellow">You could've asked me to go. It's cold outside.</font>

670
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,230
<font color="yellow">Are you at the pharmacy?</font>

671
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,170
<font color="yellow">Wait there. I'll come over.</font>

672
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,440
<font color="yellow">(Pharmacy)</font>

673
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,130
<font color="yellow">From now on, tell me if you need anything.</font>

674
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,170
<font color="yellow">Don't come out alone at night.</font>

675
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,530
<font color="yellow">I used to come out at night all the time.</font>

676
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,530
<font color="yellow">You're being overprotective.</font>

677
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,200
<font color="yellow">It's your fault that I'm like this.</font>

678
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,030
<font color="yellow">You keep getting into trouble.</font>

679
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,230
<font color="yellow">I get worried when you're out of sight.</font>

680
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

681
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,940
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

682
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
<font color="yellow">You look a bit downcast.</font>

683
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,970
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. What could've happened during such a short while?</font>

684
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,530
<font color="yellow">This won't do. You need to top up your energy.</font>

685
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

686
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,400
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thanks.</font>

687
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,570
<font color="yellow">You don't like chicken feet.</font>

688
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,270
<font color="yellow">I didn't at first,</font>

689
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,030
<font color="yellow">but it's spicy and chewy.</font>

690
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,900
<font color="yellow">It's quite addictive.</font>

691
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
<font color="yellow">Just like you.</font>

692
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

693
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,500
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I'm like chicken feet?</font>

694
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,070
<font color="yellow">You lost track of my sense of humour already.</font>

695
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,130
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying you're like chicken feet.</font>

696
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,400
<font color="yellow">I'm saying I'm addicted to you.</font>

697
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,100
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

698
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,730
<font color="yellow">Is that it? "I see"?</font>

699
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you think...</font>

700
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,940
<font color="yellow">you should say something like, "I'm addicted to you, too"?</font>

701
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,730
<font color="yellow">Have some chicken feet.</font>

702
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,670
<font color="yellow">It's good. Have some.</font>

703
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,200
<font color="yellow">- It's good. - Is it?</font>

704
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,330
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Have some more.</font>

705
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,730
<font color="yellow">Let me.</font>

706
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,530
<font color="yellow">You first.</font>

707
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,770
<font color="yellow">I ate too much.</font>

708
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,730
<font color="yellow">I'm too full to walk.</font>

709
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,830
<font color="yellow">Are you?</font>

710
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,330
<font color="yellow">Get on my back.</font>

711
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,030
<font color="yellow">- What? - If you can't walk,</font>

712
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,070
<font color="yellow">I'll carry you home. Hop on.</font>

713
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,500
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

714
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,770
<font color="yellow">I don't offer to carry just anyone.</font>

715
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,330
<font color="yellow">Get on while you have a chance or you'll regret it.</font>

716
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,270
<font color="yellow">No, I'd rather walk.</font>

717
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,130
<font color="yellow">You said you can't walk.</font>

718
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,670
<font color="yellow">I'll carry you.</font>

719
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,270
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

720
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,600
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

721
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,900
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I'll do if I catch you.</font>

722
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,670
<font color="yellow">Don't come closer.</font>

723
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,070
<font color="yellow">- Let's see what happens. - Don't come closer!</font>

724
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,330
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

725
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Yun Shil?</font>

726
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,330
<font color="yellow">Don't. Stay away from me.</font>

727
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,500
<font color="yellow">I might do something.</font>

728
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,700
<font color="yellow">She was in the neighbourhood...</font>

729
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,700
<font color="yellow">and everyone ganged up and lied to me.</font>

730
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,830
<font color="yellow">I should just...</font>

731
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,030
<font color="yellow">Don't come closer.</font>

732
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,330
<font color="yellow">- Leave me alone. - I'm coming for you.</font>

733
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,200
<font color="yellow">No, no, don't. My leg!</font>

734
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,970
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

735
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,270
<font color="yellow">You still have a fever.</font>

736
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,900
<font color="yellow">I feel fine now.</font>

737
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,530
<font color="yellow">You need to be careful.</font>

738
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,600
<font color="yellow">Let's dress your wound and sleep. I'll put you to bed.</font>

739
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,830
<font color="yellow">He'll do what?</font>

740
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,170
<font color="yellow">Put her to bed?</font>

741
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,200
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

742
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,900
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil's living with him under his parents' roof.</font>

743
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,440
<font color="yellow">Then was she pretending to be missing all the while?</font>

744
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,400
<font color="yellow">How dare she!</font>

745
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,230
<font color="yellow">I caught you at it.</font>

746
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,130
<font color="yellow">You're worse than any criminal I've known.</font>

747
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,030
<font color="yellow">You told me that Yun Shil was missing...</font>

748
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,600
<font color="yellow">but she was here all along.</font>

749
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,070
<font color="yellow">Don't you know any shame?</font>

750
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,800
<font color="yellow">- You're mistaken. - Am I?</font>

751
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,500
<font color="yellow">I saw you and followed you here.</font>

752
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,030
<font color="yellow">Have you moved in with him?</font>

753
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,130
<font color="yellow">- Let her go. - Stay out of it.</font>

754
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,670
<font color="yellow">My son loves no one but you.</font>

755
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,230
<font color="yellow">How could you shack up with...</font>

756
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,530
<font color="yellow">another man while he's behind bars?</font>

757
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,030
<font color="yellow">I said let go!</font>

758
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,070
<font color="yellow">Did you just hit me?</font>

759
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,940
<font color="yellow">I did not.</font>

760
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,400
<font color="yellow">My parents are asleep, so please leave.</font>

761
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:40,970
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

762
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,170
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to Gi Pyo?</font>

763
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,730
<font color="yellow">After all he did for you!</font>

764
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,900
<font color="yellow">Karma will get you!</font>

765
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,170
<font color="yellow">Let her go this instant!</font>

766
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,830
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil's part of my family.</font>

767
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,270
<font color="yellow">Get your hand off her!</font>

768
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,970
<font color="yellow">She's part of your family?</font>

769
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,500
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you're stealing someone else's...</font>

770
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,800
<font color="yellow">daughter-in-law?</font>

771
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,500
<font color="yellow">You're talking nonsense.</font>

772
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,870
<font color="yellow">She never was your daughter-in-law to begin with.</font>

773
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,830
<font color="yellow">Your son must have gotten his terrible manners from you.</font>

774
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,000
<font color="yellow">I don't believe this.</font>

775
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,930
<font color="yellow">Get out of my house!</font>

776
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,600
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry for causing trouble.</font>

777
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,830
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

778
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,670
<font color="yellow">When we decided to let you back in,</font>

779
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,330
<font color="yellow">my wife and I knew we'd have to go through this.</font>

780
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,830
<font color="yellow">Don't apologise.</font>

781
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,970
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

782
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,870
<font color="yellow">I'm not...</font>

783
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,570
<font color="yellow">the kind of mum...</font>

784
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,270
<font color="yellow">who wants to make her son marry into a rich family.</font>

785
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,870
<font color="yellow">I thought highly of you,</font>

786
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,600
<font color="yellow">and so...</font>

787
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,830
<font color="yellow">I thought you should and would be happier...</font>

788
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,430
<font color="yellow">to swim in larger waters which is why I pushed you.</font>

789
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,600
<font color="yellow">I give up now.</font>

790
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,300
<font color="yellow">Marriage is a big deal...</font>

791
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,370
<font color="yellow">and I was afraid that rushing it would jinx us all.</font>

792
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
<font color="yellow">I thought about it...</font>

793
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,770
<font color="yellow">and I worried myself about it.</font>

794
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,600
<font color="yellow">I think that fate...</font>

795
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,830
<font color="yellow">brought you together...</font>

796
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,770
<font color="yellow">the day Yun Shil came to work at the store.</font>

797
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,530
<font color="yellow">Let's get you married.</font>

798
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,530
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Ms Choi.</font>

799
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,900
<font color="yellow">Are you with me?</font>

800
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,200
<font color="yellow">Without a doubt.</font>

801
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,400
<font color="yellow">Let's get you both married before...</font>

802
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,030
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo gets out of prison.</font>

803
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms Choi.</font>

804
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,230
<font color="yellow">I know I'm not good enough,</font>

805
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,570
<font color="yellow">but I will do my best to look after Dong Jin.</font>

806
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,530
<font color="yellow">I'll also serve you as best I can.</font>

807
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,930
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

808
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mum and Dad.</font>

809
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,170
<font color="yellow">I wish you the best.</font>

810
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,800
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

811
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,670
<font color="yellow">all I want.</font>

812
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,400
<font color="yellow">What did you do that for?</font>

813
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,330
<font color="yellow">Don't embarrass me in front of the kids.</font>

814
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,570
<font color="yellow">I adore you.</font>

815
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,600
<font color="yellow">I like you an extra lot today.</font>

816
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,300
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

817
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,600
<font color="yellow">You're so cheeky.</font>

818
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,530
<font color="yellow">I think your dad has lost his mind.</font>

819
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,470
<font color="yellow">I don't believe this.</font>

820
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,300
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

821
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,670
<font color="yellow">Come back to earth.</font>

822
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,270
<font color="yellow">Can you pinch my cheek?</font>

823
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,230
<font color="yellow">I think I'm dreaming.</font>

824
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,600
<font color="yellow">There you go. Does it feel real now?</font>

825
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,800
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream. It's all real.</font>

826
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,370
<font color="yellow">I told you that Mum would give in.</font>

827
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,300
<font color="yellow">Is it really okay to do this?</font>

828
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,170
<font color="yellow">I'm just grateful to be by your side.</font>

829
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,570
<font color="yellow">Is it okay for us to get married?</font>

830
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,430
<font color="yellow">Of course it is. Now we can finally be happy.</font>

831
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,030
<font color="yellow">Are you smiling or crying?</font>

832
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,930
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

833
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,070
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy that I can't stop smiling...</font>

834
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,570
<font color="yellow">or crying.</font>

835
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,130
<font color="yellow">I'll make up for all the trouble...</font>

836
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,200
<font color="yellow">for the rest of our lives.</font>

837
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,200
<font color="yellow">Why can't I stop crying?</font>

838
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
<font color="yellow">I'm not sad at all.</font>

839
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,230
<font color="yellow">I'm really happy, but the tears won't stop.</font>

840
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,430
<font color="yellow">My Shiny Eyes is a crybaby.</font>

841
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,030
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

842
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,300
<font color="yellow">Isn't it cold?</font>

843
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,730
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Dad.</font>

844
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,330
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

845
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you here, Da Jeong?</font>

846
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:34,370
<font color="yellow">I came straight over from work to walk you both home.</font>

847
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,530
<font color="yellow">You were awesome tonight.</font>

848
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,230
<font color="yellow">Was I? Thanks a lot.</font>

849
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,200
<font color="yellow">I feel so much better to have two lady fans.</font>

850
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,500
<font color="yellow">Well done, dear husband.</font>

851
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,470
<font color="yellow">I cooked some pork with fermented kimchi.</font>

852
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,870
<font color="yellow">Let's go home and eat.</font>

853
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,200
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go.</font>

854
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,700
<font color="yellow">Kimchi stew with pork sounds great.</font>

855
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
<font color="yellow">- It's freezing cold. - Let's hurry home.</font>

856
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,730
<font color="yellow">- She'll pay. - Three people, please.</font>

857
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:05,900
<font color="yellow">It's so cold.</font>

858
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,270
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

859
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,100
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

860
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,370
<font color="yellow">This is Dad's song.</font>

861
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,800
<font color="yellow">It is. People must be asking the radio stations to play it.</font>

862
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,830
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Aren't you a singer?</font>

863
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,230
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

864
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,170
<font color="yellow">Didn't you sing this song?</font>

865
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,700
<font color="yellow">I think I saw you on "Music Stage".</font>

866
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,600
<font color="yellow">You're right, that was me.</font>

867
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,230
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I'm on a bus with a singer.</font>

868
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,330
<font color="yellow">I guess it's my lucky day.</font>

869
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:43,130
<font color="yellow">You're much more handsome in real life.</font>

870
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,600
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

871
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,800
<font color="yellow">This song is my favourite...</font>

872
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,930
<font color="yellow">and I sing it whenever I go to a karaoke bar.</font>

873
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,730
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir.</font>

874
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,670
<font color="yellow">Let's make the most of this meeting.</font>

875
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,600
<font color="yellow">- Could you sing for us? - What?</font>

876
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,230
<font color="yellow">Please, sing something for us.</font>

877
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,600
<font color="yellow">Not in a moving bus.</font>

878
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,570
<font color="yellow">Driver, would you mind?</font>

879
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,200
<font color="yellow">It would be an honour.</font>

880
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,030
<font color="yellow">Come on, then.</font>

881
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,400
<font color="yellow">- Sing for us. - Stand up.</font>

882
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,300
<font color="yellow">Sing your heart out, as if you're on "Music Stage".</font>

883
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,070
<font color="yellow">Good luck, Dad.</font>

884
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,870
<font color="yellow">- Applause! - Come on.</font>

885
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,730
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be shy.</font>

886
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,030
<font color="yellow">- Sing something. - Just one song.</font>

887
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,030
<font color="yellow">Hello, everyone.</font>

888
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,130
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Tae Pyung, the Gentleman of Trot.</font>

889
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,330
<font color="yellow">Right now I spend...</font>

890
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,870
<font color="yellow">most of my days singing at nightclubs.</font>

891
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,200
<font color="yellow">I dream of...</font>

892
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,000
<font color="yellow">becoming King of Singers.</font>

893
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,230
<font color="yellow">I believe that all of you here...</font>

894
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,300
<font color="yellow">did what you could today to get a step closer to your dream.</font>

895
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,030
<font color="yellow">I cheer for you and support you...</font>

896
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,900
<font color="yellow">as you strive towards your goals.</font>

897
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,870
<font color="yellow">I'm hardly good enough, but I dedicate this song to you.</font>

898
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,800
<font color="yellow">Round, round, round.</font>

899
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,330
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are so round</font>

900
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:19,500
<font color="yellow">I have fallen, fallen, fallen into them.</font>

901
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,330
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

902
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,870
<font color="yellow">When you are tired.</font>

903
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,370
<font color="yellow">Lean on my shoulders.</font>

904
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,030
<font color="yellow">When you are sick.</font>

905
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,100
<font color="yellow">Don't hesitate to give me a call</font>

906
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,470
<font color="yellow">I love you, baby.</font>

907
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,370
<font color="yellow">Do not say a word.</font>

908
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,300
<font color="yellow">Just hold me tight.</font>

909
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,400
<font color="yellow">To you, right now, immediately.</font>

910
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,030
<font color="yellow">My brother goes.</font>

911
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,270
<font color="yellow">Go, go, go.</font>

912
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:08,600
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

913
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,900
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang shoots a commercial today.</font>

914
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,170
<font color="yellow">Is that today?</font>

915
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,200
<font color="yellow">I might end up coming home early in the morning.</font>
