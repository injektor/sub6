<font color="yellow">Do you want me to send you the pictures I took?</font>

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,640
<font color="yellow">When did you take them? While I wasn't looking?</font>

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,510
<font color="yellow">I took pictures of the scenery.</font>

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,310
<font color="yellow">The calm ocean, the waves, the sunset.</font>

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,810
<font color="yellow">Fine. Send them.</font>

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,980
<font color="yellow">They say one day can equal a lifetime.</font>

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,340
<font color="yellow">That's what yesterday was to me. Thank you.</font>

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,680
<font color="yellow">You must've felt relieved, thinking it was over.</font>

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,980
<font color="yellow">Since you're thanking me,</font>

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,540
<font color="yellow">I feel like a child who took her parent on a vacation.</font>

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,940
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,510
<font color="yellow">can you exchange your life up to now for yesterday?</font>

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,640
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,180
<font color="yellow">It was hard learning how to knead and make dumplings.</font>

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,950
<font color="yellow">The bus is here.</font>

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,110
<font color="yellow">I didn't say something in case it would ruin the trip.</font>

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,010
<font color="yellow">I knew from how you looked depressed now and then.</font>

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,010
<font color="yellow">I'll be lying from now on.</font>

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,180
<font color="yellow">That's why you can't be with me.</font>

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,210
<font color="yellow">I'll just focus on protecting your land.</font>

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,440
<font color="yellow">I'll see you in court.</font>

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,010
<font color="yellow">Once tomorrow's trial is over, you're free.</font>

26
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,610
<font color="yellow">Only you and Hong Na Ri may file to annul the marriage.</font>

27
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,280
<font color="yellow">That's why we had to hold you here. Don't be too angry.</font>

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,440
<font color="yellow">Your niece just needs to testify.</font>

29
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,280
<font color="yellow">You seem to be in a good mood since we're being nice.</font>

31
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,780
<font color="yellow">- Do you feel okay?
- Yes.</font>

32
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,710
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil seems to have faith you'll stand on his side.</font>

33
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,910
<font color="yellow">- I guess the goodbye trip was worthwhile.
- No.</font>

34
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,380
<font color="yellow">I agreed to testify for my uncle.</font>

35
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,610
<font color="yellow">He isn't my stepdad anymore.</font>

36
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,910
<font color="yellow">Let me ask as a neighborhood friend.</font>

37
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,540
<font color="yellow">When did you start liking Nan Gil?</font>

38
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,410
<font color="yellow">Friends ask these things all the time.</font>

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,310
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,080
<font color="yellow">Think about your feelings for Nan Gil.</font>

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,510
<font color="yellow">Are you confused because of the void your mom left?</font>

42
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,640
<font color="yellow">If you can't even tell when it started, let it go.</font>

43
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,810
<font color="yellow">Please testify for yourself,</font>

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,980
<font color="yellow">and not for your uncle.</font>

45
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,840
<font color="yellow">I want to know when it started too.</font>

46
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,080
<font color="yellow">He came into my heart one day and keeps growing.</font>

47
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,810
<font color="yellow">Don't you understand how that feels?</font>

48
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,510
<font color="yellow">Your Honor, Shin Jung Im and Ko Nan Gil's marriage...</font>

49
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,440
<font color="yellow">lacked mutual consent of the parties...</font>

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,710
<font color="yellow">which is required in Civil Code section 815,</font>

51
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,080
<font color="yellow">and thus, their marriage is void.</font>

52
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,210
<font color="yellow">This is the marriage license that Ko Nan Gil and...</font>

53
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,880
<font color="yellow">Shin Jung Im filled out together with mutual consent.</font>

54
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,480
<font color="yellow">It fails to qualify for annulment.</font>

55
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,710
<font color="yellow">Your Honor, Shin Jung Im's brother, Shin Jung Nam,</font>

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,980
<font color="yellow">took that very picture.</font>

57
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,240
<font color="yellow">We'd like to call him to testify.</font>

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,340
<font color="yellow">Why are you claiming the marriage is void?</font>

59
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,280
<font color="yellow">My sister and I were deceived.</font>

60
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,510
<font color="yellow">Back then, we didn't know Nan Gil worked for a lender.</font>

61
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,910
<font color="yellow">He showed us a forged document...</font>

62
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,180
<font color="yellow">and said our land was being held as collateral.</font>

63
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,380
<font color="yellow">He said they must get married in order to protect it.</font>

64
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,340
<font color="yellow">That was why my sister married him. She was deceived.</font>

65
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
<font color="yellow">Objection.</font>

66
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,340
<font color="yellow">Shin Jung Im knew Ko Nan Gil for many years...</font>

67
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,040
<font color="yellow">and knew what kind of work he was doing.</font>

68
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,640
<font color="yellow">We call Kim Wan Shik, who works at the institution...</font>

69
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,840
<font color="yellow">where Ko Nan Gil worked, to the stand.</font>

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,880
<font color="yellow">Your Honor, he is unrelated to this case.</font>

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
<font color="yellow">Objection denied.</font>

72
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,280
<font color="yellow">What is your relationship with Ko Nan Gil?</font>

73
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,940
<font color="yellow">We were once brothers and we worked together.</font>

74
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,140
<font color="yellow">You worked together for a loan shark, correct?</font>

75
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,240
<font color="yellow">What kind of person is Ko Nan Gil?</font>

76
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,310
<font color="yellow">He was called "the legendary Ko Nan Gil".</font>

77
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,140
<font color="yellow">Everyone in the industry feared him. He was evil.</font>

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,440
<font color="yellow">He'd collect 10 times the principal...</font>

79
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,210
<font color="yellow">without batting an eye.</font>

80
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,140
<font color="yellow">He used violence, drafted unfair contracts,</font>

81
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,740
<font color="yellow">and got them to sign them.</font>

82
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,110
<font color="yellow">He boasted about the fact that he was an ex-con.</font>

83
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,680
<font color="yellow">You'll hear everything about me at the trial.</font>

84
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,610
<font color="yellow">Should I not go, then?</font>

85
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,210
<font color="yellow">No. Go and listen to it all.</font>

86
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,080
<font color="yellow">I'm the disease.</font>

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,380
<font color="yellow">It was created because of my dark,</font>

88
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,680
<font color="yellow">damp, and smelly past.</font>

89
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,240
<font color="yellow">The witness is making unsubstantiated statements...</font>

90
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,040
<font color="yellow">about my client that are irrelevant to the case.</font>

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,780
<font color="yellow">Ko Nan Gil went to prison to take responsibility...</font>

92
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,610
<font color="yellow">for his company's insolvency as the person in charge.</font>

93
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,610
<font color="yellow">It is unrelated to violence. He is committing perjury.</font>

94
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,410
<font color="yellow">Your Honor, I will submit a police record...</font>

95
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,840
<font color="yellow">of the investigation of Ko Nan Gil...</font>

96
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,410
<font color="yellow">for threatening Shin Jung Nam.</font>

97
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,840
<font color="yellow">Objection. He was found not culpable.</font>

98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,880
<font color="yellow">Your Honor, the biggest victim of this marriage con...</font>

99
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,640
<font color="yellow">is here today.</font>

100
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,580
<font color="yellow">I'd like to call Hong Na Ri, Shin Jung Im's daughter,</font>

101

- Hey, Duk Shim.</font>

107
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,340
<font color="yellow">Get over here. I said to get over here.</font>

108
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780

109

<font color="yellow">Let me play with it.</font>

110
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,340
<font color="yellow">Why those punks.</font>

111
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,510
<font color="yellow">- Give me your camera.
- No.</font>

112

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,440
<font color="yellow">Infinite has a concert coming up.</font>

114
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,080

118
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,480
<font color="yellow">We didn't know your family's lawyer would be so tough.</font>

119
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,880
<font color="yellow">My sister was wrong for harassing you...</font>

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,980
<font color="yellow">and transferred her land and restaurant?</font>

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,710
<font color="yellow">Over there!</font>

150
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,680
<font color="yellow">What could it be made of?</font>

151
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,980

152
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,980
<font color="yellow">Tell me what means "Hong Na Ri".</font>

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,810
<font color="yellow">I'm not a charity.</font>

463
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,640
<font color="yellow">We won't make it a park when it can be buildings.</font>

464
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,040
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what Grandpa did to the land?</font>

465
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,280
<font color="yellow">"The dead doesn't talk."</font>

466
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you know the famous saying?</font>

467
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,080
<font color="yellow">He built an orphanage on explosives. That's murder!</font>

468
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,810
<font color="yellow">I won't touch that land.</font>

469
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,510
<font color="yellow">Forget it if that's what you want to do.</font>

470
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,140
<font color="yellow">Family should protect each other.</font>

471
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,810
<font color="yellow">I'm so sick of you and our family.</font>

472
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,810
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

473
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,850
<font color="yellow">You must have something to say.</font>

474
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,440
<font color="yellow">Na Ri is here with her stuff.</font>

475
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,010
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

476
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,680
<font color="yellow">Take this to her.</font>

477
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,580
<font color="yellow">I told you to study. Why do you keep doing this?</font>

478
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,110
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

479
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,910
<font color="yellow">We realized this time around that you're not needed.</font>

480
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,240
<font color="yellow">We did all this by ourselves.</font>

481
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,010
<font color="yellow">Also, your daughter just moved here.</font>

482
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,350
<font color="yellow">He didn't know?</font>

483
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,740
<font color="yellow">I guess you're feeling better now.</font>

484
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,940
<font color="yellow">I heard you moved here.</font>

485
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,640
<font color="yellow">This is our home. I have a room here. I'm jobless.</font>

486
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,880
<font color="yellow">There is no reason for me to pay rent in Seoul.</font>

487
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,740
<font color="yellow">Don't sigh, or you'll have something to sigh about.</font>

488
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,540
<font color="yellow">How long do you plan on staying?</font>

489
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,580
<font color="yellow">A year.</font>

490
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,510
<font color="yellow">See me after work. You need to sign an agreement.</font>

491
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,040
<font color="yellow">- What agreement?
- After that trial, I like law.</font>

492
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,780
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to be around me,</font>

493
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,080
<font color="yellow">so we should agree on spaces each will be using.</font>

494
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,080
<font color="yellow">Bring anything you'd like to add on paper.</font>

495
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,850
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. I'm going to work.</font>

496
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,940
<font color="yellow">I was just dropping by on my way to Seoul.</font>

497
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,410
<font color="yellow">You can drop by more often.</font>

498
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,110
<font color="yellow">Hey, Duk Bong is here.</font>

499
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,710
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

500
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,780
<font color="yellow">It's been a while and I even brought you this.</font>

501
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,480
<font color="yellow">How can you greet me like that?</font>

502
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,740
<font color="yellow">Since I brought it, take it.</font>

503
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,480
<font color="yellow">Great. Have you been well?</font>

504
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,540
<font color="yellow">That's half-hearted.</font>

505
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,540
<font color="yellow">Your stepfather asked me to visit more often.</font>

506
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Seoul. I'll call you on my way back.</font>

507
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,240
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Your stepfather told me...</font>

508
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,580
<font color="yellow">to drop by more often.</font>

509
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,410
<font color="yellow">- Wan Shik.
- Yes.</font>

510
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,410
<font color="yellow">How far will you go for me?</font>

511
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,310
<font color="yellow">I can do anything you ask me.</font>

512
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,640

515
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,640
<font color="yellow">I was under investigation because of you...</font>

516
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,350
<font color="yellow">and was called in by prosecutors.</font>

517
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280

523
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,380

524
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,850
<font color="yellow">You're...</font>

525
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,010
<font color="yellow">more afraid of Na Ri finding out instead of the police.</font>

526
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,880
<font color="yellow">If you want to be treated like a father,</font>

527
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,540
<font color="yellow">don't come threatening me with fake documents.</font>

00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,380
<font color="yellow">We asked her about a man who died five years ago.</font>

532

577
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,580
<font color="yellow">One moment.</font>

578
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,180
<font color="yellow">Bring your coat.</font>

579
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,440
<font color="yellow">I have a partner. Why should I follow you out?</font>

580
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,710
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that people are talking?</font>

581
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,240
<font color="yellow">I'm fast with these things, and I didn't feel it.</font>

582
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,010
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about me, not you.</font>

583
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,480
<font color="yellow">I'm being made a fool!</font>

584
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,380
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling at me?</font>

585
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,580
<font color="yellow">I came here with my partner. I didn't know you'd come.</font>

586
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,380
<font color="yellow">You didn't know?</font>

587
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,510
<font color="yellow">Well, I did. But it doesn't matter to me.</font>

588
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,210
<font color="yellow">I hate it when other people talk about me.</font>

589
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,210
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about your ex-fiancee?</font>

590
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,110
<font color="yellow">If you got engaged then broke up,</font>

591
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,380
<font color="yellow">just consider it a gossip for your friends and ignore.</font>

592
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,010
<font color="yellow">They think it's fun because you get upset.</font>

593
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,910
<font color="yellow">If she looks like me and I'm here...</font>

594
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,110
<font color="yellow">with you like this, they'll talk more.</font>

595
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,180
<font color="yellow">Who says you look like her?</font>

596
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,910
<font color="yellow">You're getting riled up just talking about her.</font>

597
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,940
<font color="yellow">I guess you didn't get over it yet.</font>

598
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo.</font>

599
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,910
<font color="yellow">You and Na Ri are completely different.</font>

600
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,740
<font color="yellow">How are we different?</font>

601
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,640
<font color="yellow">What you see in Na Ri is everything.</font>

602
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,710
<font color="yellow">She never hides anything.</font>

603
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,740
<font color="yellow">However, she's difficult.</font>

604
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,380
<font color="yellow">On the other hand,</font>

605
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're thinking.</font>

606
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,010
<font color="yellow">However, you're easy.</font>

607
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,710
<font color="yellow">If you're going to talk nonsense,</font>

608
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,640
<font color="yellow">don't ruin my day and just leave.</font>

609
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,640
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Time to go home.</font>

610
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,080
<font color="yellow">- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.</font>

611
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,510
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Boss.
- Good job today.</font>

612
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,240
