00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:10,880
<font color="yellow">94% subbed</font>

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,240
<font color="yellow">Episode 4</font>

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,960
<font color="yellow">Sir, last night in many villages along the west coast, they say there was a strange occurrence.</font>

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,880
<font color="yellow">The clothes that were hung in the backyards, and shoes disappeared.</font>

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,160
<font color="yellow">In their place, they say a rare quality pearl was left.</font>

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,760
<font color="yellow">A pearl?</font>

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,320
<font color="yellow">Oh My!</font>

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,160
<font color="yellow">How can there be a burglar who takes only a few clothes and leave such a thing as a pearl behind?</font>

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,520
<font color="yellow">If only the burglar also decided to stop by here...</font>

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
<font color="yellow">Look here, Hong Nan half your dresser is pearls and precious treasures of gold and silver</font>

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,720
<font color="yellow">I apologize that this concubine is overflowing with materialistic greed.</font>

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,880
<font color="yellow">Since I am not able to completely have my spouse to myself, just think that I am compensating for that emptiness with material goods.</font>

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,200
<font color="yellow">What I mean Hong Na Ra is</font>

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,360
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that I will fill that other half of your dresser with jewels.</font>

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,840
<font color="yellow">How long would that take...</font>

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,400
<font color="yellow">Even though I'm busy as you can see, do you know why I'm on fire trying to catch a mermaid?</font>

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
<font color="yellow">If I catch a mermaid, I can beat her and extract her tears again, and again</font>

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,840
<font color="yellow">so that underneath each step you take can be adorned lavishly with pearls.</font>

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,000
<font color="yellow">That's my plan.</font>

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,120
<font color="yellow">And you have a way to catch one?</font>

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,280
<font color="yellow">Method or not, that one will come back on her own.</font>

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so Caretaker Jeon?</font>

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
<font color="yellow">That's right. From the old times, the mermaid would come up to the village</font>

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,800
<font color="yellow">and wear the clothes or eat food, they were sure to pay it back;</font>

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,840
<font color="yellow">with rare pearls that can only be found outside the city.</font>

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,920
<font color="yellow">So are you saying that the clothing thief was a mermaid?</font>

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,080
<font color="yellow">Are you saying a mermaid came up to this village?</font>

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,080
<font color="yellow">The mermaid who has fallen for the human must not go back.</font>

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,840
<font color="yellow">That is part of their inherent nature.</font>

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,080
<font color="yellow">For a mermaid that can only love once in her lifetime</font>

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,840
<font color="yellow">She stakes her life on that one love.</font>

32
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
<font color="yellow">For the mermaid, her one true love has appeared</font>

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,120
<font color="yellow">and for me the lone opportunity has presented itself.</font>

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,320
<font color="yellow">Let's do it like this, Caretaker Jeon.</font>

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,920
<font color="yellow">Put out people to catch the mermaid before the village head does</font>

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,920
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan you do your best to make sure a vicious rumor is circulated as swift as possible.</font>

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,720
<font color="yellow">By vicious rumor you mean...?</font>

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,400
<font color="yellow">The vicious rumor should be that recently a huge storm has caused the fishing boats to go missing</font>

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,880
<font color="yellow">is all because of that bad omen, a mermaid.</font>

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,880
<font color="yellow">When the mermaid was washed ashore and caught, since all of that happened</font>

41
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,040
<font color="yellow">it really does seem to be true.</font>

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
<font color="yellow">This kid's smart.</font>

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,880
<font color="yellow">But that ominous mermaid</font>

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,160
<font color="yellow">with malicious intent selfishly hid herself deep inside the village while taking human form.</font>

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,040
<font color="yellow">But if we are unable to stop her, an even bigger calamity would unfold</font>

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,960
<font color="yellow">many people will be injured and die.</font>

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,720
<font color="yellow">In five days time</font>

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,640
<font color="yellow">They'll be brimming with concern over the wind and waves</font>

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,320
<font color="yellow">there's no better timing than this!</font>

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
<font color="yellow">There's nothing better than fear to stop the people's thoughts.</font>

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,360
<font color="yellow">The village head also cannot help but deal with the scared witless villagers.</font>

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,080
<font color="yellow">Of course, sir.</font>

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,080
<font color="yellow">If we're good, we can also force the village head into a deadly situation along with the mermaid.</font>

54
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,280
<font color="yellow">Naive love is giving me great joy.</font>

55
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,080
<font color="yellow">Aigoo the mermaid that was caught yesterday</font>

56
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,960
<font color="yellow">has been seen again, have you heard?</font>

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,000
<font color="yellow">They say that storm was caused by the mermaid!</font>

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,600
<font color="yellow">Aigoo what can be done. With the strong winds, isn't my husband going to return as a sea monster if he rides out in his boat? (will be dead at sea, becoming a ghost haunting the ocean)</font>

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
<font color="yellow">- Then we need to immediately capture and kill that witch!  - Exactly!</font>

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
<font color="yellow">What's the village head doing?!</font>

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,880
<font color="yellow">Village Head! They say the mermaid has come up to the village!</font>

62
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,040
<font color="yellow">Everyone is about to die!</font>

63
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,120
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you can't come here and be like this!</font>

64
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,640
<font color="yellow">I got the message so please go back!</font>

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
<font color="yellow">Look, have you finally lost your mind?</font>

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,200
<font color="yellow">Didn't you just receive report on what kind of strange rumors are circulating within the administrative district.</font>

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320
<font color="yellow">But what? Who're you going to find?</font>

68
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,320
<font color="yellow">I think Se Hwa came to see me. I had requested it last time.</font>

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,600
<font color="yellow">I asked her to come see me at the 20th solar division (lays between the first day of winter and the first big snow, around the 22nd of November)</font>

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,320
<font color="yellow">and that I want to be able to see the first snow with her.</font>

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,600
<font color="yellow">I mean...look here. For someone who's educated why are you being like this!</font>

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
<font color="yellow">The subdivisions in the year are just that.</font>

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,640
<font color="yellow">Just because it is November 22th it doesn't mean that the snow will be like falling--</font>

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,800
<font color="yellow">Dam Ryeong! Dam Ryeong!</font>

75
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
<font color="yellow">You can 't!</font>

76
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,040
<font color="yellow">If that woman really won't be able to go back, that means she risked her life.</font>

77
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,200
<font color="yellow">The same goes for me. What am I not able to stake at this point?</font>

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,360
<font color="yellow">Please think it through! Think of your father's honor!</font>

79
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,440
<font color="yellow">In Shin An (county)'s Docho Island, Yeosu's Geomoon Island, Incheon's Jeongmoon</font>

80
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,360
<font color="yellow">the places where the mermaids frequent, tell the elders, there is but one answer:</font>

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,920
<font color="yellow">The biggest weakness of the mermaid who can't go back</font>

82
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,160
<font color="yellow">are her legs. After her legs are severely wounded</font>

83
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,920
<font color="yellow">Legend of the Blue Sea</font>

84
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,080
<font color="yellow">The whereabouts of Ma Dae Young who was jailed in the Seoul Correctional Facility for murder charges, is</font>

85
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
<font color="yellow">unknown for the last three months. Unlike the initial prediction by the police that he'll soon be apprehended</font>

86
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,760
<font color="yellow">there isn't any headway in the investigation elevating the fears of the citizens.</font>

87
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,600
<font color="yellow">That crazy.</font>

88
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ahjumma. You also packed the crabs in soy sauce, right?</font>

89
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,920
<font color="yellow">Oh my. What happens if I bring this as is and the sauce would leak all over?</font>

90
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,040
<font color="yellow">I already told you before.</font>

91
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,000
<font color="yellow">If I ask to have food for take out, you should pay special attention to it.</font>

92
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,960
<font color="yellow">I should have it stand like this?</font>

93
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,280
<font color="yellow">Don't put it on the trunk but place it on the floor in the car and secure it.</font>

94
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,600
<font color="yellow">On the car's floor? Securely?</font>

95
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,920
<font color="yellow">You should be careful when you carry it.</font>

96
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,720
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

97
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,120
<font color="yellow">Oh my! So funny. I'm speechless.</font>

98
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam. It's me, Jin Joo.</font>

99
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,640
<font color="yellow">No. I have some side dishes that I think would match your taste and thought of you.</font>

100
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, please taste it.</font>

101
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,160
<font color="yellow">Wow, Mother. There's so many delicious things today.</font>

102
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,320
<font color="yellow">Jin Joo gave it to us while saying it was made at her house.</font>

103
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,800
<font color="yellow">Is that so? If the one concerning about it is fine then.</font>

104
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,400
<font color="yellow">No, Father. I'm fine with everything if my parents like it.</font>

105
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,400
<font color="yellow">Honey, our Chi Hyeon is like this. Others say he's a Papa's boy.</font>

106
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,480
<font color="yellow">It's not good to be that too much.</font>

107
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

108
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
<font color="yellow">-How is it? -Don't make me speak.</font>

109
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
<font color="yellow">-It's too delicious. -Right?</font>

110
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
<font color="yellow">Is it good, Joon Jae?</font>

111
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,880
<font color="yellow">Don't make me speak. It's too delicious.</font>

112
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,240
<font color="yellow">Aigoo, we gave you the name 'Joon Jae' for you to become 'a brilliant man.'</font>

113
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,080
<font color="yellow">But in order for our son to be a brilliant man, don't you have to be a conglomerate first, honey?</font>

114
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,960
<font color="yellow">-When are you going to become a conglomerate? -Wait just a little bit. Just a little bit.</font>

115
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,640
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make you a Madam and you'll be wearing luxury goods from head to toe.</font>

116
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,520
<font color="yellow">See if you don't!</font>

117
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,520
<font color="yellow">Here, eat the meaty part.</font>

118
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,760
<font color="yellow">Why, honey? Does it not match your tastes?</font>

119
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,960
<font color="yellow">No, it's really good. You try it too.</font>

120
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,280
<font color="yellow">-Chi Hyeon. -Yes, Father? -You try it too.</font>

121
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,120
<font color="yellow">Ah, no. I have a shellfish allergy.</font>

122
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,320
<font color="yellow">They must have picked someone good now.</font>

123
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,720
<font color="yellow">Honey...?</font>

124
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

125
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,600
<font color="yellow">Perhaps... do you keep in touch with Joon Jae these days?</font>

126
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,400
<font color="yellow">Today, it's your son's birthday so must have thought about him.</font>

127
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,760
<font color="yellow">I know that until this summer he lived near Ssamcheongdong.</font>

128
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
<font color="yellow">But it seems he has moved out again.</font>

129
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,360
<font color="yellow">It's hard to find out his address.</font>

130
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
<font color="yellow">What he's been doing... that pathetic punk.</font>

131
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
<font color="yellow">Now, you should make up.</font>

132
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,480
<font color="yellow">Make what up? Between a father and a son.</font>

133
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,080
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it because it's you. But the only blood relative I have is Joon Jae.</font>

134
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,800
<font color="yellow">Now I need to find him and have him beside me. I have a lot to teach him.</font>

135
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,360
<font color="yellow">Can you get him?</font>

136
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,160
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

137
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
<font color="yellow">It's his birthday today.</font>

138
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,000
<font color="yellow">He'll appear there.</font>

139
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,680
<font color="yellow">Find out where he is. When you find out,</font>

140
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,280
<font color="yellow">make him disappear.</font>

141
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

142
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,080
<font color="yellow">I'll ask again.</font>

143
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

144
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, over there! Please hold onto her. Why is she fast?</font>

145
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,400
<font color="yellow">Aigoo. Thank you. She's someone who went into the aquarium without our permission.</font>

146
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,040
<font color="yellow">We need to investigate her.</font>

147
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

148
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,280
<font color="yellow">I am Detective Hong Dok Kyeong from the Myeongdong Violent Crimes Department. I received a report.</font>

149
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,400
<font color="yellow">Already? Who reported her?</font>

150
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,080
<font color="yellow">- I didn't. - Maybe the security team reported it.</font>

151
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,360
<font color="yellow">Are you the one in charge?</font>

152
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,480
<font color="yellow">I might need to investigate, when that time comes I will call you.</font>

153
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,000
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. I understand.</font>

154
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,080
<font color="yellow">We need to go together.</font>

155
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,160
<font color="yellow">I didn't get you out to save you.</font>

156
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,080
<font color="yellow">There's something I need to know. So tell me an answer.</font>

157
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,840
<font color="yellow">This. Why were we together?</font>

158
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,680
<font color="yellow">Why am I in here with Heo Joon Jae?</font>

159
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,200
<font color="yellow">You know my name?</font>

160
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,520
<font color="yellow">You know me, right?</font>

161
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,600
<font color="yellow">You don't know?</font>

162
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,840
<font color="yellow">You do know or you don't know?</font>

163
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,160
<font color="yellow">You know me. You know my name too.</font>

164
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,880
<font color="yellow">It's right that we were in Spain together.</font>

165
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,880
<font color="yellow">But why do I not know you? Who are you?</font>

166
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

167
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,960
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

168
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,440
<font color="yellow">I don't have a name.</font>

169
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,920
<font color="yellow">-You don't have a name? -Nope.</font>

170
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,160
<font color="yellow">I don't have a name, but I was told I'm not a strange person.</font>

171
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,640
<font color="yellow">-By who? -A good person.</font>

172
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what kind of person he/she was, but there's a high chance they're pretty strange too.</font>

173
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,800
<font color="yellow">Your words and actions...everything is strange.</font>

174
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,080
<font color="yellow">Do you not speak Korean well? Are you an overseas Korean?</font>

175
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,920
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask you for the last time.</font>

176
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,040
<font color="yellow">What happened between us in Spain?</font>

177
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,400
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure I met you, but why don't I remember anything?</font>

178
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,560
<font color="yellow">Was there an accident that happened that I don't know about?</font>

179
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,720
<font color="yellow">You don't have anything to say to me, right?</font>

180
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,880
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of things I'm curious about, but you don't have anything to say to me...</font>

181
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,840
<font color="yellow">So isn't it useless to keep being together?</font>

182
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,520
<font color="yellow">Why? You have something to say to me?</font>

183
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,120
<font color="yellow">Then don't follow me.</font>

184
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,240
<font color="yellow">Your nose is really good right now!</font>

185
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,440
<font color="yellow">Don't ever do surgery.</font>

186
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
<font color="yellow">Ah, I'm not a strange person.</font>

187
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,840
<font color="yellow">What do you see?</font>

188
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,560
<font color="yellow">But your nose is blocking a lot of bad energy. But then...</font>

189
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,120
<font color="yellow">it's ambiguous. No matter how nice your nose is, your mourning energy is stronger.</font>

190
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,520
<font color="yellow">In the ground, your ancestors are crying.</font>

191
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,880
<font color="yellow">What are ancestors?</font>

192
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,560
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

193
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,440
<font color="yellow">The people who made you, the people who made them, the people who made them are those people.</font>

194
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,520
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't be in the ground.</font>

195
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,680
<font color="yellow">If it's not in the ground, where?</font>

196
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,840
<font color="yellow">Underwater?</font>

197
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,200
<font color="yellow">Ah! They weren't buried.</font>

198
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,160
<font color="yellow">So you spread their ashes on the river, I see.</font>

199
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,640
<font color="yellow">Well, wherever it is...</font>

200
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,520
<font color="yellow">It's important that your ancestors are crying.</font>

201
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,640
<font color="yellow">- Why are they crying? - What do you mean "why"?</font>

202
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,440
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

203
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,440
<font color="yellow">Gong</font>

204
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,360
<font color="yellow">This 'gong', okay? With this 'gong,'</font>

205
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,520
<font color="yellow">if you read it backwards, what does it become?</font>

206
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,640
<font color="yellow">You know how the word 'nim' turns into 'nam' if you put a dot in it?</font>

207
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,840
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing!</font>

208
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,520
<font color="yellow">If you read this 'gong' backwards...?</font>

209
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,280
<font color="yellow">Ah, really.</font>

210
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
<font color="yellow">Here, here.</font>

211
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
<font color="yellow">What does it say?</font>

212
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,280
<font color="yellow">That's right! It's 'fortune!' That's right!</font>

213
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,680
<font color="yellow">What does this mean? If you have 'gong' then 'fortune' will also follow.</font>

214
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,000
<font color="yellow">Wow! This truth is so scientific,</font>

215
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,520
<font color="yellow">and proven, that's what I'm saying.</font>

216
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,960
<font color="yellow">You have a strong energy.</font>

217
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,400
<font color="yellow">You are strong and sassy too.</font>

218
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,680
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, if you go to the parking lot</font>

219
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,160
<font color="yellow">it's there on standby.</font>

220
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,600
<font color="yellow">Why? What? Who are you?</font>

221
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,280
<font color="yellow">Me? Your ancestor.</font>

222
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,520
<font color="yellow">To go and get you.</font>

223
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,040
<font color="yellow">Wow, really. Who are yoÃ¢ÂÂ</font>

224
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,520
<font color="yellow">Ah, this man. Oh?</font>

225
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,200
<font color="yellow">Aish, this jerk! Pick-pocketing again?</font>

226
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,400
<font color="yellow">I'm going to report you immediately. I'm going to report you!</font>

227
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,960
<font color="yellow">You're going to regret it! If I report you...</font>

228
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,200
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

229
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,760
<font color="yellow">If you give it to me right now, I'l leave quietly.</font>

230
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,120
<font color="yellow">It's because I can't have my identity leaked.</font>

231
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,560
<font color="yellow">Ah, cold.</font>

232
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,560
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you this because it seems you don't really know what's going on.</font>

233
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,600
<font color="yellow">You can't follow people like that man.They will rip you off a lot.</font>

234
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,520
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

235
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
<font color="yellow">Dog Nam Doo</font>

236
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,920
<font color="yellow">Yeah, why?</font>

237
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,280
<font color="yellow">Ah, what are you going? What's wrong with you?</font>

238
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,040
<font color="yellow">It's a gun!</font>

239
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,360
<font color="yellow">A gun?</font>

240
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,960
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's not a gun.</font>

241
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,720
<font color="yellow">Stay still, Joon Jae. I'll protect you.</font>

242
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,320
<font color="yellow">Ah, no, who's protecting who?</font>

243
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,440
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

244
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,200
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes. Believe in my words.</font>

245
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
<font color="yellow">Look at the sky.</font>

246
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,880
<font color="yellow">- I feel that your eyes  -</font>

247
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,640
<font color="yellow">- are sparkling  -</font>

248
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,880
<font color="yellow">- more than any other words.   -</font>

249
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,240
<font color="yellow">Listen well. Protecting others...</font>

250
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,280
<font color="yellow">comes after protecting yourself. The order is like that.</font>

251
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,720
<font color="yellow">It's a stupid thing to switch the order.</font>

252
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
<font color="yellow">It's not hot?</font>

253
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,800
<font color="yellow">Are you listening to me?</font>

254
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,200
<font color="yellow">That... it isn't hot if you touch it?</font>

255
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,960
<font color="yellow">Is this really your first time seeing fireworks?</font>

256
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,120
<font color="yellow">Fireworks?</font>

257
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,400
<font color="yellow">There is a place called the Han River. In the fall, they have a fireworks display there.</font>

258
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,200
<font color="yellow">Wow, that's incredibly beautiful.</font>

259
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,960
<font color="yellow">I'll let you watch it with me.</font>

260
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,480
<font color="yellow">Fireworks display?</font>

261
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,440
<font color="yellow">That's right. Is this really your first time seeing it?</font>

262
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,520
<font color="yellow">You can't touch it. Look, right when it explodes, it disappears.</font>

263
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,640
<font color="yellow">- From the moment I hear you coming to me .  -</font>

264
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,560
<font color="yellow">- Come a step closer.  -</font>

265
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,760
<font color="yellow">- So I can hear your breath  -</font>

266
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,480
<font color="yellow">- My heart is tilted towards you  -</font>

267
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,760
<font color="yellow">- Bit by bit, bit by bit.  -</font>

268
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,560
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone doing this?</font>

269
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,320
<font color="yellow">They're taking pictures.</font>

270
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,880
<font color="yellow">Taking pictures? What is that?</font>

271
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,560
<font color="yellow">Ah, are you asking because you really don't know?</font>

272
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,680
<font color="yellow">- Why is it like a miracle everyday.  -</font>

273
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,240
<font color="yellow">Here, like this.</font>

274
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,480
<font color="yellow">"Ah," what even.</font>

275
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,600
<font color="yellow">But why aren't you taking pictures? Everyone else is.</font>

276
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,840
<font color="yellow">Because I can just remember it.</font>

277
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,360
<font color="yellow">You're keeping it here, aren't you?</font>

278
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,000
<font color="yellow">Usually, good and pretty things disappear quickly, Joon Jae.</font>

279
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,320
<font color="yellow">Like this, with your eyes, you look at it well,</font>

280
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,000
<font color="yellow">and then you keep it in your heart like this.</font>

281
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,800
<font color="yellow">Then when you have a sad day, you think about it.</font>

282
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,200
<font color="yellow">You go, "At that time, the fireworks in the sky were really pretty."</font>

283
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,360
<font color="yellow">"Ah, that day was really good."</font>

284
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,720
<font color="yellow">-Mom, we're going to come again next time, right?</font>

285
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
<font color="yellow">-Of course. -And the next time too?</font>

286
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,440
<font color="yellow">-Of course! -And the next time.</font>

287
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,600
<font color="yellow">-Of course! -It's for real.</font>

288
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,480
<font color="yellow">-Yeah!</font>

289
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,560
<font color="yellow">But why do you keep speaking informally?</font>

290
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,920
<font color="yellow">I'm going to speak informally now too then.</font>

291
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
<font color="yellow">Should we watch golf?</font>

292
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,520
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute...</font>

293
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,560
<font color="yellow">No, Ahjumm...</font>

294
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,080
<font color="yellow">Nevermind. You can watch golf now.</font>

295
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,560
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

296
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,280
<font color="yellow">What "thank you"?</font>

297
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,720
<font color="yellow">This is our TV; this is our house.</font>

298
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,120
<font color="yellow">Why are you following the Ahjumma's words exactly?</font>

299
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Weirdly, every time she orders something, I do it.</font>

300
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

301
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,760
<font color="yellow">I'm following him right now,</font>

302
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,080
<font color="yellow">but he's with some girl.</font>

303
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,880
<font color="yellow">But how did you know he would be here today?</font>

304
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,240
<font color="yellow">He did that since he was young.</font>

305
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,680
<font color="yellow">Even after growing up, he hasn't fixed his habit.</font>

306
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,160
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, where are you going?</font>

307
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,040
<font color="yellow">My mom and I planned to meet each other on my birthday.</font>

308
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,640
<font color="yellow">Mom will be waiting.</font>

309
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,520
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go!</font>

310
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,280
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Then go.</font>

311
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,480
<font color="yellow">Your mom won't come.</font>

312
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,680
<font color="yellow">Because your father gave her a lot of money.</font>

313
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,720
<font color="yellow">But if she meets you, she has to return all of that money.</font>

314
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,920
<font color="yellow">Why do you think your mother left you without a word?</font>

315
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,280
<font color="yellow">It's because she likes the money way more than she likes you.</font>

316
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,160
<font color="yellow">No! No, my mom isn't like that.</font>

317
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,800
<font color="yellow">My mom isn't like that!</font>

318
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
<font color="yellow">What's with him now?</font>

319
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,880
<font color="yellow">He said he's meeting his mother.</font>

320
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,360
<font color="yellow">This bast***.</font>

321
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,160
<font color="yellow">Go into your room!</font>

322
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you shouting at him when it's over something sad?!</font>

323
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,760
<font color="yellow">No, no, my mom...</font>

324
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,600
<font color="yellow">My mom will come to see me.</font>

325
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,960
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, don't cry. Your step-mother is sad.</font>

326
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,400
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, I'm sorry.</font>

327
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,800
<font color="yellow">Find out where he lives today.</font>

328
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,520
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

329
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,800
<font color="yellow">I need to live for you to live.</font>

330
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,480
<font color="yellow">Hang up. He's moving.</font>

331
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,320
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep following me? I need to go.</font>

332
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,720
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

333
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,040
<font color="yellow">Can't I go with you?</font>

334
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,440
<font color="yellow">Together? Where? My house?</font>

335
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,960
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

336
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,360
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

337
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,280
<font color="yellow">Of course you can't. How could a woman go to a man's house?</font>

338
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,240
<font color="yellow">If your parents knew, what would they say?</font>

339
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,720
<font color="yellow">I don't have any parents.</font>

340
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,440
<font color="yellow">Then answer me. We know each other, right? Something happened, right?</font>

341
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,800
<font color="yellow">See.</font>

342
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,640
<font color="yellow">It's because you're like this, on what basis do I bring you home?</font>

343
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,920
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

344
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,040
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say to me later, then contact me then.</font>

345
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,040
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

346
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,160
<font color="yellow">I don't know her. What am I supposed to do?</font>

347
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,360
<font color="yellow">I like it that I'm in Seoul.</font>

348
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,800
<font color="yellow">You really don't know Seoul?</font>

349
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sure.</font>

350
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,400
<font color="yellow">It's cold. I'm closing the window.</font>

351
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,840
<font color="yellow">I like it that I'm with you.</font>

352
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,080
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

353
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm trying to compare something.</font>

354
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,840
<font color="yellow">Say it to me.</font>

355
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,320
<font color="yellow">Huh? What?</font>

356
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,280
<font color="yellow">That. That "I lo..."</font>

357
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,480
<font color="yellow">Nevermind. Do it later.</font>

358
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,480
<font color="yellow">Ah, who's this guy now.</font>

359
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,560
<font color="yellow">Are you still looking at that?</font>

360
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,000
<font color="yellow">Oh right.</font>

361
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,600
<font color="yellow">Have you seen a drawing such as this?</font>

362
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,440
<font color="yellow">There's none.</font>

363
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,520
<font color="yellow">How could a person from the Joseon Dynasty draw something like this?</font>

364
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,200
<font color="yellow">The Professor said, it might have been that the painter rode a time machine and saw the future.</font>

365
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,800
<font color="yellow">Somehow...</font>

366
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,280
<font color="yellow">Feels very similar to someone I know.</font>

367
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,600
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

368
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,600
<font color="yellow">There's someone. It's his birthday.</font>

369
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,680
<font color="yellow">Come inside.</font>

370
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,200
<font color="yellow">Hey! How can you bring her here? Are you crazy?</font>

371
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,960
<font color="yellow">Did she hear?</font>

372
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,040
<font color="yellow">Is there nothing to eat in here?</font>

373
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,480
<font color="yellow">Why would something to eat be in there? Come over here.</font>

374
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, miss, where is your house?</font>

375
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,080
<font color="yellow">It's far.</font>

376
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,520
<font color="yellow">Mine's far too. It's in Namyangju.</font>

377
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,480
<font color="yellow">Mine's rea...</font>

378
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,200
<font color="yellow">...lly far.</font>

379
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,080
<font color="yellow">She doesn't match with me. Joon Jae, she doesn't match with me.</font>

380
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,880
<font color="yellow">What would you do if she did match? Is someone giving a blind date for you?</font>

381
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,080
<font color="yellow">But even so, we'll be living together.</font>

382
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,640
<font color="yellow">"Living together" my butt.</font>

383
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,400
<font color="yellow">You are also mooching of right now. You guys should leave now.</font>

384
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,280
<font color="yellow">Oh my. This guy is so vicious.</font>

385
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,680
<font color="yellow">If Tae Oh and I leave together, what are you guys going to do in one house together?</font>

386
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,880
<font color="yellow">Ah, would I keep this girl with me?</font>

387
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,240
<font color="yellow">I brought her because there's something I have to check.</font>

388
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,040
<font color="yellow">What are you checking? Hey, don't take it out! Don't take it out!</font>

389
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,600
<font color="yellow">You...know about this, right?</font>

390
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
<font color="yellow">You know about it, right?</font>

391
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,160
<font color="yellow">-Yeah.  -Is it yours?</font>

392
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,920
<font color="yellow">I gave it to you.</font>

393
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,040
<font color="yellow">You gave this to me?</font>

394
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,840
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Because you liked it.</font>

395
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,880
<font color="yellow">Yeah, he probably did like it.</font>

396
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,280
<font color="yellow">But it isn't an object that can be given just because he liked it.</font>

397
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,120
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're really kind. It's sad to take it.</font>

398
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,960
<font color="yellow">There's a lot of things like this in my house.</font>

399
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,960
<font color="yellow">You have a lot?</font>

400
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,760
<font color="yellow">Yeah, if you just search around, there's a lot.</font>

401
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,240
<font color="yellow">Is that so? There's a lot if you search around.</font>

402
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,400
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae. Lets let her stay at our house for a moment.</font>

403
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
<font color="yellow">Look at you talking about her staying here.</font>

404
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,800
<font color="yellow">Why? She said she doesn't know anyone in Seoul. But do you really have a lot of this stuff at home?</font>

405
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,760
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

406
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,920
<font color="yellow">We...No, this oppa will help you with this harsh life in Seoul.</font>

407
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,440
<font color="yellow">Instead, you can't forget that I helped you.</font>

408
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
<font color="yellow">If you want to give thanks when you return home, you can do that too.</font>

409
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,200
<font color="yellow">I know the bracelet but, you, who gave the bracelet to me; I do not know?</font>

410
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,160
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes sense?</font>

411
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,040
<font color="yellow">See? She talks so well but when an important topic comes up she won't speak!</font>

412
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,760
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't be too harsh. There must be a situation.</font>

413
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,960
<font color="yellow">But what's your name?</font>

414
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,880
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have one.</font>

415
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,800
<font color="yellow">She...she doesn't have one?</font>

416
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,440
<font color="yellow">-Why do people keep asking whether I have a name?  -That's an interesting question.</font>

417
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,680
<font color="yellow">People ask because they need to call you with a name.</font>

418
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,920
<font color="yellow">They can't call me if I don't have a name?</font>

419
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,640
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard. It's easier to call people with a name.</font>

420
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,920
<font color="yellow">If I have a name, will you call for me?</font>

421
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,120
<font color="yellow">-I guess I will if I have to.  -Then make me a name.</font>

422
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,960
<font color="yellow">-Make what? Do you think I would do that?  -Give me a name!</font>

423
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,200
<font color="yellow">A name comes from the feeling when you look at that person.</font>

424
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,240
<font color="yellow">The image of that person. When I look at you, I think of Hepburn. Audrey Hepburn.</font>

425
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,680
<font color="yellow">If you watch the movie, the princess would roam around not knowing anything.</font>

426
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,720
<font color="yellow">Shall I say I could feel such vibe?</font>

427
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,440
<font color="yellow">What about that name? Oh Deu Ree (sounds like Audrey.) Last name Oh. First name Deu Ree.</font>

428
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,040
<font color="yellow">Just... Shim Cheong Yi.</font>

429
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,000
<font color="yellow">She's extremely dumb. So Shim Cheong Yi is just right.</font>

430
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,280
<font color="yellow">How could you be so insincere towards a person?</font>

431
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,520
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

432
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,480
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? He's teasing you that you're stupid!</font>

433
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,760
<font color="yellow">I like that name. Shim Cheong Yi. I like it.</font>

434
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,080
<font color="yellow">It fits her. You have a knack for naming.</font>

435
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,960
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

436
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,280
<font color="yellow">I'm Tae Oh.</font>

437
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,640
<font color="yellow">I'm Shim Cheong Yi.</font>

438
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,480
<font color="yellow">But still, it's your birthday so I thought you should have a cake.</font>

439
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,160
<font color="yellow">On my way home...</font>

440
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,800
<font color="yellow">You had a guest! Who is she?</font>

441
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,200
<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

442
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,600
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Shim Cheong Yi.</font>

443
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,800
<font color="yellow">I see...</font>

444
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,720
<font color="yellow">AH THAT SCARED ME!</font>

445
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you like this? Get off of me!</font>

446
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,080
<font color="yellow">Get off!</font>

447
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,120
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

448
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,960
<font color="yellow">You eat this after you blow out the candles.</font>

449
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,560
<font color="yellow">Lets sing the happy birthday song!</font>

450
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,040
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you-</font>

451
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,520
<font color="yellow">Eat it after taking out the candles. Here.</font>

452
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,840
<font color="yellow">Ah!</font>

453
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,720
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

454
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,600
<font color="yellow">Noone will steal it from you. Eat it slowly.</font>

455
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,400
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae. Have some too.</font>

456
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,680
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I'll do it myself.</font>

457
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,560
<font color="yellow">Hey. Eat it from her. She must feel embarrassed.</font>

458
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,320
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

459
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,720
<font color="yellow">Oh right. Joon Jae, you will go on Professor Jin's retirement party next week, right?</font>

460
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,440
<font color="yellow">I will be meeting with him tomorrow separately. I also have something to talk to him about.</font>

461
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,800
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin was so disappointed when ever he started a new project.</font>

462
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,840
<font color="yellow">He's saying how it would have been nice if you were there to help.</font>

463
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,480
<font color="yellow">So, she will be here for the mean time?</font>

464
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,480
<font color="yellow">I stopped him too. I did.</font>

465
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,920
<font color="yellow">But Joon Jae is weak against justice. She also seems mentally unstable and all.</font>

466
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:58,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so bothered about that girl who doesn't even know her own name.</font>

467
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,800
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

468
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,000
<font color="yellow">You should hold still and not leave this house.</font>

469
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,840
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

470
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,440
<font color="yellow">There's no room so where is she going to sleep?</font>

471
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,880
<font color="yellow">Honestly, there is another room.</font>

472
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,760
<font color="yellow">Come up.</font>

473
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,360
<font color="yellow">Do I live here?</font>

474
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,480
<font color="yellow">Get your senses together. What do you mean "live"?</font>

475
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,320
<font color="yellow">I have something to find out that's why I'm letting you stay for a while.</font>

476
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,720
<font color="yellow">It's only for a few days.</font>

477
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,840
<font color="yellow">Aigoo.</font>

478
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,760
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

479
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,200
<font color="yellow">Of course you should be thankful.</font>

480
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,400
<font color="yellow">Let's now live quietly.</font>

481
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,560
<font color="yellow">Hey! I can hear everything!</font>

482
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,480
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae! It's morning. Let's eat breakfast!</font>

483
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,400
<font color="yellow">Ahw!</font>

484
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,040
<font color="yellow">The delicious meal is cooking.</font>

485
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,200
<font color="yellow">Right, start. It would be better if you would hurry.</font>

486
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,160
<font color="yellow">You're doing all sorts of things.</font>

487
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,880
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's nice how this feels like a home.</font>

488
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,440
<font color="yellow">Hey, where did all the milk go?</font>

489
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,840
<font color="yellow">There's one person who drank it in one shot saying she's hungry while waiting for the food.</font>

490
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,640
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can always say what is right.</font>

491
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,880
<font color="yellow">Is anyone in there?</font>

492
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,040
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone home?</font>

493
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,600
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone home?</font>

494
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,640
<font color="yellow">I don't! Just because of this, you woke up a sleeping person?</font>

495
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,240
<font color="yellow">Hey! What are you doing?</font>

496
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,440
<font color="yellow">I saw you! What are you doing?</font>

497
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,000
<font color="yellow">You are a thief, right? Don't you move.</font>

498
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,040
<font color="yellow">This bastard.</font>

499
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, you crazy bastard?</font>

500
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,240
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

501
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,480
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

502
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,440
<font color="yellow">Why did I go there?</font>

503
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,360
<font color="yellow">We were apart and I hurt my head.</font>

504
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,320
<font color="yellow">Certainly.</font>

505
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,880
<font color="yellow">What is it, seriously?</font>

506
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hyung?</font>

507
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,080
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, stop. Stop.</font>

508
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,880
<font color="yellow">- What? - Look up front.</font>

509
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,440
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

510
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,240
<font color="yellow">What is it? What happened?</font>

511
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,760
<font color="yellow">The one living next door, what on earth. There's a murder case.</font>

512
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,240
<font color="yellow">- What? - I also called Tae Ho telling him not to come home.</font>

513
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,520
<font color="yellow">Hurry and turn the car around. Detective Hong is out there.</font>

514
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,440
<font color="yellow">Detective Hong, who is so bent on catching you. He also saw your face three years ago.</font>

515
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I said turn the car around.</font>

516
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,480
<font color="yellow">Cheong Yi is alone at home.</font>

517
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,360
<font color="yellow">What matters if she's alone for a while.</font>

518
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,000
<font color="yellow">If you will keep on staying here then they will be suspicious.</font>

519
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? It's not even on your district.</font>

520
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,880
<font color="yellow">I heard the weapon used was a hammer. It's definitely Mah Dae Young.</font>

521
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:13,160
<font color="yellow">Is it only Mah Dae Young who uses a hammer to murder? The victim was a loan shark so it's 100% obviously a revenge.</font>

522
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:19,440
<font color="yellow">Where do you find a 100% on a case? First, let's look at the possibility. If it's not then I'll step out if it isn't.</font>

523
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,720
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Heo Joon Jae coming?</font>

524
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,920
<font color="yellow">Hey! You shouldn't have appeared in front of me!</font>

525
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,280
<font color="yellow">You should have lived without knowing!</font>

526
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,560
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you a secret.</font>

527
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,440
<font color="yellow">Your father is...</font>

528
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,480
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Move.</font>

529
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,680
<font color="yellow">Speak. Is she dead?</font>

530
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,880
<font color="yellow">Is it Heo Joon Jae?</font>

531
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,880
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully. Protecting someone else is after protecting yourself. That's how the order is.</font>

532
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,240
<font color="yellow">Changing that order is being stupid. Do you understand?</font>

533
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,040
<font color="yellow">Hyung, move.</font>

534
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,480
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

535
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,240
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to be stupid then move.</font>

536
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:12,080
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Hey! Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!</font>

537
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,920
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

538
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,200
<font color="yellow">Sa Wol. Sa Wol.</font>

539
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

540
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,640
<font color="yellow">Today is such a nice day. Open the jars.</font>

541
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,280
<font color="yellow">That way it will get light and the taste will be better.</font>

542
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,480
<font color="yellow">All of them?</font>

543
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,400
<font color="yellow">Is it too difficult?</font>

544
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,360
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

545
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,760
<font color="yellow">Should I do it?</font>

546
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,920
<font color="yellow">No, Madam. I should do it.</font>

547
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,680
<font color="yellow">Sa Wol.</font>

548
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam!</font>

549
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,160
<font color="yellow">I have almost finished it.</font>

550
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:38,160
<font color="yellow">Seeing the clouds, it seems like there will be a shower.</font>

551
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,280
<font color="yellow">Close them.</font>

552
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,760
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

553
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,720
<font color="yellow">The jar's cover.</font>

554
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,720
<font color="yellow">I just... opened them.</font>

555
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,720
<font color="yellow">Should I do it?</font>

556
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,320
<font color="yellow">Madam! I will close all the covers.</font>

557
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,320
<font color="yellow">No. You have something else to do.</font>

558
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,040
<font color="yellow">That punk, no matter how long I wait, there's no reply.</font>

559
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:15,560
<font color="yellow">Go and hand my letter and personally get a reply.</font>

560
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:24,600
<font color="yellow">Madam, I think she knows that's why she's doing it, to tear us apart.</font>

561
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,880
<font color="yellow">If we were born again, let's meet as a couple.</font>

562
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,320
<font color="yellow">And live 100 years.</font>

563
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,240
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't have been born like this.</font>

564
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:46,400
<font color="yellow">That's right. Next lifetime, I will be born rich.</font>

565
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,880
<font color="yellow">What do you want to be reborn as?</font>

566
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,720
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

567
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,600
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

568
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,040
<font color="yellow">Sa Wol!</font>

569
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,080
<font color="yellow">I want to be that b*tch master.</font>

570
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,960
<font color="yellow">The Legend of the Blue Sea</font>

571
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,520
<font color="yellow">If you don't say anything until tomorrow, then you must leave this place.</font>

572
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,680
<font color="yellow">Don't stay here like a queen and leave.</font>

573
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,640
<font color="yellow">Did you really let her leave in this cold weather?</font>

574
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,720
<font color="yellow">You said you would not turn your back on someone who as nothing, what happened to you, Heo Joon Jae?</font>

575
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,760
<font color="yellow">Next time at this time, let's do it on the first day of snow.</font>

576
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,680
<font color="yellow">Let's meet there. I have something to tell you.</font>

577
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,520
<font color="yellow">- So that I could feel your breath .  -</font>
