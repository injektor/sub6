00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:08,838
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 48)</font>

3
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:11,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Forgive me, Yun Shil.</font>

4
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:16,438
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what Dong Jin said to you,</font>

5
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,168
<font color=#FFFF00>but I truly would have given your father my kidney.</font>

6
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You were there. You saw me smiling as I entered the operating room.</font>

7
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,498
<font color=#FFFF00>At that moment, I was being sincere.</font>

8
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,338
<font color=#FFFF00>For the past 10 years,</font>

9
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:36,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to tell you this myself.</font>

10
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I promised myself that I'd tell you the truth several times.</font>

11
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:43,538
<font color=#FFFF00>But I was worried you might leave me,</font>

12
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,438
<font color=#FFFF00>so I couldn't find the courage to tell you.</font>

13
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:50,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

14
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,938
<font color=#FFFF00>The fact that I wasn't able to give my kidney to your father...</font>

15
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:04,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin...</font>

16
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:08,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- didn't say anything to you? - So...</font>

17
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,398
<font color=#FFFF00>you didn't...</font>

18
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:14,898
<font color=#FFFF00>give your kidney to my father.</font>

19
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this what you're saying?</font>

20
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:30,998
<font color=#FFFF00>How...</font>

21
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>could you do that?</font>

22
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:38,068
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you?</font>

23
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,668
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you?</font>

24
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,638
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you lie about something like that?</font>

25
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't mean to lie to you,</font>

26
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:09,438
<font color=#FFFF00>but I thought that was the only way I could make you stay with me.</font>

27
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:11,438
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry, Yun Shil.</font>

28
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry too much.</font>

29
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,898
<font color=#FFFF00>(Operating Room)</font>

30
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:31,968
<font color=#FFFF00>See you later.</font>

31
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,598
<font color=#FFFF00>They said they need...</font>

32
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,938
<font color=#FFFF00>to remove a tumour in his pancreas before the kidney transplant,</font>

33
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,538
<font color=#FFFF00>so your father went into the operating room first.</font>

34
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:45,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I also went into the OR and was about to go under anaesthesia...</font>

35
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:49,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Please request a pathology test on the tumour we just removed.</font>

36
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:53,298
<font color=#FFFF00>And let the donor know that we're done here. He should get ready.</font>

37
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, his vital signs are dropping.</font>

38
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr Choi. Epinephrine, please.</font>

39
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr Park. Get ready for CPR.</font>

40
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:03,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr Kim, let the donor know of the recipient's cardiac arrest.</font>

41
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:17,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

42
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, the recipient went into cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis.</font>

43
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,098
<font color=#FFFF00>We cannot do the transplant now.</font>

44
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:28,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Hong, can you hear me?</font>

45
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:30,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Please open your eyes if you can hear me.</font>

46
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Hong, can you hear me?</font>

47
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Is the surgery done?</font>

48
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,268
<font color=#FFFF00>The recipient went into cardiac arrest,</font>

49
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,768
<font color=#FFFF00>- so it has been put on hold. - Cardiac arrest?</font>

50
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he going to be okay?</font>

51
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,268
<font color=#FFFF00>We should wait and see what happens.</font>

52
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:54,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Please go to the recovery room and wait there...</font>

53
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Hong, you have to be careful. It can be dangerous.</font>

54
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,868
<font color=#FFFF00>You should lie down.</font>

55
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:02,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I have an urgent matter. Don't bother me.</font>

56
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:05,138
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me go. - Catch him!</font>

57
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:13,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss, are you done with your surgery already?</font>

58
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheong Man, take Yun Shil to somewhere else.</font>

59
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:16,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

60
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil should not meet the doctor. Take her to somewhere else.</font>

61
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:40,868
<font color=#FFFF00>How is everything?</font>

62
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,638
<font color=#FFFF00>We've prepared the funeral.</font>

63
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,498
<font color=#FFFF00>We're keeping our eyes on Yun Shil...</font>

64
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:46,398
<font color=#FFFF00>so that she doesn't meet your doctor.</font>

65
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:52,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil should never find out that I didn't have the surgery.</font>

66
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:54,138
<font color=#FFFF00>If that happens, you and I are through.</font>

67
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,308
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Boss.</font>

68
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,338
<font color=#FFFF00>You thought your dad died during the transplant,</font>

69
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,898
<font color=#FFFF00>but actually, something went wrong right after removing the tumor,</font>

70
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:11,638
<font color=#FFFF00>and he died within an hour of being transferred...</font>

71
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:13,338
<font color=#FFFF00>to ICU from the operating room.</font>

72
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,308
<font color=#FFFF00>At the funeral,</font>

73
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,568
<font color=#FFFF00>you looked me in the eyes for the first time.</font>

74
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:29,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It seemed that I could never see your face again...</font>

75
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:33,538
<font color=#FFFF00>if I told you that I didn't donate my kidney to your dad.</font>

76
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:36,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It was because I loved you.</font>

77
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know that.</font>

78
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:43,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I've felt that I'm in debt to you for 10 years.</font>

79
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to run away,</font>

80
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,498
<font color=#FFFF00>but I've endured it all along.</font>

81
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it all because of your lie?</font>

82
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,038
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

83
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:01,368
<font color=#FFFF00>make such a lie?</font>

84
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:06,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Sometimes it's better not to know something than to know it.</font>

85
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I did it for you.</font>

86
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:13,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all because of that Lee Dong Jin.</font>

87
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:17,568
<font color=#FFFF00>If only he didn't find it out, I could take the secret to the grave.</font>

88
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he know...</font>

89
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:26,268
<font color=#FFFF00>all about this?</font>

90
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:30,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you hear about this from him?</font>

91
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't he really tell you anything?</font>

92
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Yun Shil.</font>

93
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to lose you because I loved you so much.</font>

94
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:48,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't help it.</font>

95
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:52,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make it up to you.</font>

97
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Big money is going to be in my hands soon.</font>

98
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:01,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you all of it.</font>

99
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,138
<font color=#FFFF00>That will be enough compensation.</font>

100
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:07,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to make up for my life...</font>

101
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,338
<font color=#FFFF00>with that money?</font>

102
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:14,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think that can be a compensation for my life?</font>

103
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,238
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yun Shil. - Get out of here.</font>

104
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of my sight!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>(Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

106
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:02,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

107
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Isn't he Hong Gi Pyo? - That's him.</font>

108
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,938
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness. Yun Shil! - Why was he here again?</font>

109
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,538
<font color=#FFFF00>We should tell Mum.</font>

110
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:21,368
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be better for her to know before your condition gets worse.</font>

111
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:26,638
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Mum should prepare her heart.</font>

112
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:30,738
<font color=#FFFF00>She exhausted herself...</font>

113
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:33,838
<font color=#FFFF00>preparing for Dong Sook's wedding and your wedding.</font>

114
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:36,798
<font color=#FFFF00>She's barely holding on now.</font>

115
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:38,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure whether it's a good idea...</font>

116
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:42,568
<font color=#FFFF00>to tell her about my condition.</font>

117
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,438
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a point,</font>

118
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:48,668
<font color=#FFFF00>but your field of vision would gradually narrow down.</font>

119
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:52,908
<font color=#FFFF00>We should tell Mum quickly and plan some safety measures.</font>

120
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:57,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I will move more carefully and be cautious.</font>

121
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:02,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I think we should delay telling Gok Ji about this.</font>

122
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm getting trained about my condition. If I get more used to it,</font>

123
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,908
<font color=#FFFF00>things would be better, I suppose.</font>

124
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,238
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

125
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:15,598
<font color=#FFFF00>By then, be careful not to get hurt again.</font>

126
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I surely will.</font>

127
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:28,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I'm late.</font>

128
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:29,838
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here.</font>

129
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:32,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Mr Lee?</font>

130
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I took him home.</font>

131
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:37,268
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, where's Yun Shil?</font>

132
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:40,908
<font color=#FFFF00>She's totally exhausted, so I told her to take a rest.</font>

133
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:42,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened? Is she sick?</font>

134
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:45,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Hong Gi Pyo visited a while ago,</font>

135
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,468
<font color=#FFFF00>and made some trouble, so she was shocked.</font>

136
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:48,498
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

137
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

138
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,908
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go to the hospital.</font>

139
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell me?</font>

140
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:16,098
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew that Gi Pyo lied about his kidney donation to Dad.</font>

141
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:20,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew about it.</font>

142
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell me anything?</font>

143
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:28,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it would trouble you.</font>

144
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You're holding on already,</font>

145
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:36,868
<font color=#FFFF00>and you could blame yourself if you know the truth.</font>

146
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:39,098
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I didn't tell you about it.</font>

147
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:41,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so, you should've told me.</font>

148
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:47,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have known even if the truth troubles me.</font>

149
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:51,908
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to tell you once you become stable. I'm sorry.</font>

150
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:57,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so furious and distressed.</font>

151
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:02,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I regret all those years of living in guilt because of his lie.</font>

152
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:06,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm angry about troubling you because of him.</font>

153
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:11,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It makes me so angry. I can't stand it.</font>

154
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:22,668
<font color=#FFFF00>How about thinking that you had a long nightmare?</font>

155
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:27,038
<font color=#FFFF00>You woke up from the bad dream, so forget about it.</font>

156
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,938
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been through so much.</font>

157
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:36,338
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have had a hard time enduring it alone.</font>

158
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,738
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go home and take a rest today.</font>

159
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:49,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

160
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:53,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm giving an order as a CEO. You should go home and rest today.</font>

161
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:55,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I would be relieved.</font>

162
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:00,768
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

163
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:04,098
<font color=#FFFF00>how is Father?</font>

164
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:08,298
<font color=#FFFF00>His field of vision is getting narrow quickly.</font>

165
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:11,038
<font color=#FFFF00>The doctor says it will get worse.</font>

166
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Are there any surgery or treatment for it?</font>

167
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:23,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Father is taking it calmly,</font>

168
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:26,868
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't take it in well.</font>

169
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not the only one who needs to be comforted.</font>

170
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:32,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

171
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home now.</font>

172
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:45,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here at this time of the day?</font>

173
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:49,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil seems to have a cold.</font>

174
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that there's the flu going around.</font>

175
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:52,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you been to the hospital?</font>

176
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I took some medicine. I'm fine, Mother.</font>

177
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:58,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't look fine. Your face is so pale.</font>

178
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Take her inside and let her lie down.</font>

179
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:02,168
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

180
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go to the signing ceremony today.</font>

181
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:36,798
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right. Don't worry about that and take some sleep.</font>

182
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:40,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine. Don't worry about me and go quickly.</font>

183
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,038
<font color=#FFFF00>You might be late.</font>

184
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Call me if you feel worse. I'll take you to the hospital.</font>

185
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,298
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You should go now.</font>

186
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'm leaving.</font>

187
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:08,468
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you doing now? - I'll show you my surgical wound.</font>

188
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:12,238
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like you've forgotten how grateful you should be for me,</font>

189
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,398
<font color=#FFFF00>so I want to help you refresh your memory.</font>

190
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it going to rain later today? Where I got the surgery is hurting.</font>

191
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it hurt a lot?</font>

192
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,798
<font color=#FFFF00>A pain relieving patch and rest should make the pain go away.</font>

193
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:29,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I should go back in and rest.</font>

194
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,868
<font color=#FFFF00>(CEO of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop, Lee Dong Jin)</font>

195
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,298
<font color=#FFFF00>(Partnership Signing Ceremony)</font>

196
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:47,938

197
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:51,268
<font color=#FFFF00>(Partnership Signing Ceremony)</font>

198
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,368
<font color=#FFFF00>If you give me a little more time,</font>

199
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure to sort everything out.</font>

200
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- So please... - It's already bad as it is,</font>

201
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:28,368
<font color=#FFFF00>but it'll only get worse with all the promissory notes that are due.</font>

202
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:31,138
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't even have any measures as to how you'll pay them.</font>

203
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:34,138
<font color=#FFFF00>For any promissory notes that require payment,</font>

204
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:37,838
<font color=#FFFF00>- we'll have to issue a moratorium. - What are you saying?</font>

205
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- You'll dishonour them? - That's right.</font>

206
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,638
<font color=#FFFF00>We have no choice.</font>

207
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:45,098
<font color=#FFFF00>My personal assets are on it as collateral.</font>

208
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:47,168
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you think that I won't be able to sort it out?</font>

209
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to pay them. I'll pay everything off!</font>

210
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been fooled.</font>

211
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Had I known this would happen,</font>

212
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:05,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't have agreed to use my personal assets as collateral.</font>

213
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:13,668
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to suggest a solution to the creditors before they act first.</font>

214
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:15,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Since the chairman's tenure,</font>

215
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:18,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa Apparel was the most profitable when the company was...</font>

216
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:22,298
<font color=#FFFF00>run by the deputy CEO, Mr Lee. We need to let the creditors know.</font>

217
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Sir. I'll be in touch again soon.</font>

218
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:32,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's up? - I will...</font>

219
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,598
<font color=#FFFF00>cut to the chase.</font>

220
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Help me just this once, Hyo Joo.</font>

221
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm stuck at this foundation, so I have no power to help you.</font>

222
00:16:43,098 --> 00:16:46,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me use your real estate properties as collateral for a loan.</font>

223
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll repay you for everything and more if this goes well.</font>

224
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,868
<font color=#FFFF00>You're trying to drag me into your mess.</font>

225
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:55,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you don't want to die alone.</font>

226
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:59,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Help me just this once, please. The promissory notes are due today.</font>

227
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:02,538
<font color=#FFFF00>If I can't pay them, the company will have to declare bankruptcy.</font>

228
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think anything will change by paying that promissory note?</font>

229
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:09,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's say I help you make the payment today. What will be next?</font>

230
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:12,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll figure out the rest after that,</font>

231
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,638
<font color=#FFFF00>so please help me out today. Hyo Joo,</font>

232
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad worked so hard to build this company. Isn't it important to you?</font>

233
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You're even bringing up our deceased dad.</font>

234
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,238
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be so desperate. But give up.</font>

235
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:26,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I do not want to help you.</font>

236
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:29,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, let's be honest. If the company goes under,</font>

237
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:31,198
<font color=#FFFF00>do you think your foundation won't be affected?</font>

238
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,398
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not attached to this place. - I won't be doomed alone.</font>

239
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:36,898
<font color=#FFFF00>If the company collapses, all of us will be doomed.</font>

240
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Your family will go bankrupt.</font>

241
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I have nothing to do with you people.</font>

242
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:45,068
<font color=#FFFF00>"You people"? Gosh, seriously.</font>

243
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you don't think of us as a family at all.</font>

244
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Family?</font>

245
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever treated me like your family?</font>

246
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,838
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't believe this. - You brought this upon yourself,</font>

247
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:01,468
<font color=#FFFF00>so you should take care of it yourself.</font>

248
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:06,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll regret this one day.</font>

249
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:09,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to make sure you regret doing this to me.</font>

250
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:26,568
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a long time, Madam Sun.</font>

251
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:30,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm calling because...</font>

252
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:33,838
<font color=#FFFF00>there's a piece of land I want to buy in Gangwon Province.</font>

253
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,608
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have enough cash on hand at the moment,</font>

254
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,698
<font color=#FFFF00>so I was wondering if you can lend me five big ones.</font>

255
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay you generous interest.</font>

256
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:42,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Rumours say your company might go bankrupt.</font>

257
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've put some money aside to buy land.</font>

258
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:49,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you're quick-witted when it comes to those things.</font>

259
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:52,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's spreading such a groundless rumour?</font>

260
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Groundless rumour? Whatever.</font>

261
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:57,198
<font color=#FFFF00>There were a few newspaper articles about it, too.</font>

262
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:00,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it. I don't want your money.</font>

263
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:03,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you trying to put a curse on our robust company or what?</font>

264
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:04,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to hang up.</font>

265
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:10,608
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you there? Hello? - Yes, Ma'am.</font>

266
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Go bring me something to calm myself down.</font>

267
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:16,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Ma'am.</font>

268
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:25,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello? - How did it go, Mum?</font>

269
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:27,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you manage to get it? - You punk.</font>

270
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:31,038
<font color=#FFFF00>You've already taken so much money from me. How can you ask for more?</font>

271
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:36,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I've given you everything I have. I'm penniless now because of you!</font>

272
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:45,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - My goodness, my head is splitting.</font>

273
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:46,898
<font color=#FFFF00>The medicine.</font>

274
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh... - Here it is.</font>

275
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:53,338
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness...</font>

276
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh...</font>

277
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:18,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

278
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:29,398
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you heading out for work? - Yes.</font>

279
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:32,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you decided to move back home?</font>

280
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:36,108
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I was just passing by.</font>

281
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't look like that's the case.</font>

282
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:47,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop being so stubborn and come back home.</font>

283
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:52,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang's company is in a bind,</font>

284
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,968
<font color=#FFFF00>so it's very tense at home.</font>

285
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:57,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't distress Mother even more...</font>

286
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:00,838
<font color=#FFFF00>just because of someone like Tae Yang. That's just not right.</font>

287
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:04,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You may feel like you can't live without him at the moment,</font>

288
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:07,138
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's just a fleeting emotion. Later on, you'll look back...</font>

289
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:09,568
<font color=#FFFF00>and wonder why you did this.</font>

290
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll come to realise it."I was so foolishly blinded by love."</font>

291
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm like you?</font>

292
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:19,538
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Why are you so rude to me?</font>

293
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:20,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever.</font>

294
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:24,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Give these cupcakes to Mum. Tell her that you bought them.</font>

295
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her I was leaving for work. How can I give this to her now?</font>

296
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:30,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell her you thought of her and bought them on your way to work.</font>

297
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:34,238
<font color=#FFFF00>She probably hasn't been eating. Take these to her.</font>

298
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,938
<font color=#FFFF00>They're from her favourite cupcake place.</font>

299
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:39,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You take them to her.</font>

300
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,168
<font color=#FFFF00>My shift is starting shortly, so I have to go now.</font>

301
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,298
<font color=#FFFF00>How rude.</font>

302
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who is it? - It's me, Ji Yun.</font>

303
00:21:57,938 --> 00:22:01,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving a box of cupcakes in front of the door for Mother.</font>

304
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:04,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Shall I come get them now?</font>

305
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:07,538
<font color=#FFFF00>She's gone.</font>

306
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:14,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

307
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:19,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have believed him.</font>

308
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too foolish.</font>

309
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It must've hurt you tremendously.</font>

310
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

311
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:34,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

312
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:36,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, how are you feeling?</font>

313
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:39,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine now. I'm feeling much better.</font>

314
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Did the ceremony go well?</font>

315
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:44,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I left as soon as it ended because I was so worried about you.</font>

316
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll head home now. Meet me outside.</font>

317
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,338
<font color=#FFFF00>You're downhearted.</font>

318
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:51,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's skip work and go on a date instead.</font>

319
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:55,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't use me as an excuse to slack off.</font>

320
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:58,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really okay.</font>

321
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:02,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be perfectly fine after a little more rest.</font>

322
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:05,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

323
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:08,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'll see you in a bit.</font>

324
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello, it's me. - Hi, Sun Nyeo.</font>

325
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:22,468
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you need to make any deposits? - Yes.</font>

326
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hold on. Let me see. Here. - Thank you.</font>

327
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,038
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like you had a great day yesterday.</font>

328
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,298
<font color=#FFFF00>At this rate, you'll own a building soon.</font>

329
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:40,338
<font color=#FFFF00>(Enter amount)</font>

330
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:42,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You're funny. Try this.</font>

331
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:46,868
<font color=#FFFF00>It almost tastes like ice cream.</font>

332
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:50,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It literally melts in your mouth.</font>

333
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,638
<font color=#FFFF00>- There you go. - Thank you.</font>

334
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:54,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Have another great day!</font>

335
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll close the window.</font>

336
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:08,238
<font color=#FFFF00>He reminds me of when...</font>

337
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:11,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I ran a fried chicken stall with Sam Do.</font>

338
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:14,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we have two chickens and a soda?</font>

339
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:15,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Just a moment.</font>

340
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go. Enjoy.</font>

341
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:20,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir. - Yes?</font>

342
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:22,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me help you. - What?</font>

343
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:25,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I used to sell fried chicken in a Daejeon market...</font>

344
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:26,798
<font color=#FFFF00>until a while ago.</font>

345
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll fry the chicken while you serve the customers.</font>

346
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much.</font>

347
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:34,368
<font color=#FFFF00>(The best-tasting crispy chicken)</font>

348
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:44,438
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll fry you a delicious chicken in no time.</font>

349
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:53,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, I'm Tae Pyung, the gentleman of trot.</font>

350
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Lee Dong Sook, his manager.</font>

351
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:59,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a pleasure to meet you.</font>

352
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:04,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while since Tae Pyung did a live radio show.</font>

353
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,938
<font color=#FFFF00>- He'll need a lot of help. - Thank you.</font>

354
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:11,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never met such a beautiful manager before.</font>

355
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:15,268
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't mind me asking, how do you know each other?</font>

356
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his cousin.</font>

357
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:22,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Standby, everyone.</font>

358
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Good luck, Tae Pyung.</font>

359
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thanks. - You, too.</font>

360
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,438
<font color=#FFFF00>You can watch us online.</font>

361
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:34,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the Four O'clock Live Cafe.</font>

362
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:36,768
<font color=#FFFF00>With us today is the singer of...</font>

363
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,198
<font color=#FFFF00>"My Brother Goes", a revolutionary trot masterpiece.</font>

364
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:42,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet Tae Pyung. Hello.</font>

365
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:45,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, everyone.</font>

366
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:48,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Tae Pyung, the gentleman of trot.</font>

367
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Your nickname is "the gentleman of trot"...</font>

368
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:53,768
<font color=#FFFF00>and it suits you because you look great in a suit.</font>

369
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it? Thank you.</font>

370
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Since we're talking about suits,</font>

371
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:01,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I get mine at a tailor shop in Hyoja-dong that boasts...</font>

372
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,298
<font color=#FFFF00>a very long history.</font>

373
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:07,068
<font color=#FFFF00>The shop is called W Tailor Shop.</font>

374
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:10,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Check out the shop's website and social media...</font>

375
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:12,768
<font color=#FFFF00>if you want to see the best suits available.</font>

376
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:16,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I really should as soon as this show's over.</font>

377
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:21,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Before we start, let's listen to everyone's favourite song.</font>

378
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:24,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you sing "My Brother Goes"?</font>

379
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:25,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

380
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:29,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Have one each.</font>

381
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- You, too. - Thanks.</font>

382
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

383
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:36,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Take good care of Tae Pyung for me.</font>

384
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he really still single?</font>

385
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:40,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course he is.</font>

386
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:43,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you could say he married his music.</font>

387
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for this.</font>

388
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:46,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

389
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:52,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm crazy, crazy, crazy for you</font>

390
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:54,338
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

391
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:57,968
<font color=#FFFF00>When I'm asleep I think of you</font>

392
00:26:57,968 --> 00:27:01,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Until the sun rises</font>

393
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Look after him. - Sure.</font>

394
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:08,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so lonely I get angry</font>

395
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:12,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss you so much</font>

396
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:16,398
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother goes, goes, goes</font>

397
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:20,198
<font color=#FFFF00>He goes at full speed</font>

398
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:23,468
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother goes, goes, goes</font>

399
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:27,868
<font color=#FFFF00>He is coming to you</font>

400
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:31,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Do not say a word</font>

401
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:34,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Just hold me tight</font>

402
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:37,398
<font color=#FFFF00>To you, right now, immediately</font>

403
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:40,568
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother goes</font>

404
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,638
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother goes</font>

405
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:50,868
<font color=#FFFF00>(Meesa Apparel)</font>

406
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:05,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

407
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,038
<font color=#FFFF00>We got a call from the bank.</font>

408
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:11,638
<font color=#FFFF00>They will declare us bankrupt.</font>

409
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:13,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I got the call, too.</font>

410
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:17,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What will happen to Meesa?</font>

411
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:19,168
<font color=#FFFF00>The creditors are already meeting up...</font>

412
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:21,638
<font color=#FFFF00>to discuss legal management procedures.</font>

413
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you stop it?</font>

414
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:25,638
<font color=#FFFF00>I know all that. Leave me alone!</font>

415
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:28,738
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't just sit around and do nothing.</font>

416
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,598
<font color=#FFFF00>We should put out a statement...</font>

417
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:35,138
<font color=#FFFF00>The real issue is our liquid capital.</font>

418
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:39,998
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you sell off our assets and put us in this situation?</font>

419
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:44,698
<font color=#FFFF00>No company wants to buy our outdoor clothing brand...</font>

420
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,898
<font color=#FFFF00>and the price of our land is forecasted to drop further.</font>

421
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,438
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't sell our menswear line just to save the company.</font>

422
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:57,138
<font color=#FFFF00>We're a piece of meat left out for the wild beasts.</font>

423
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:58,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you get that?</font>

424
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:02,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone's drooling, waiting to take a bite out of us.</font>

425
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,698
<font color=#FFFF00>They're waiting for us to give up.</font>

426
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it. Leave.</font>

427
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:13,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out!</font>

428
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:28,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- Too bad. - She bragged so much.</font>

429
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:31,698
<font color=#FFFF00>The company went belly-up at last.</font>

430
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:32,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

431
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Ji Yun.</font>

432
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:37,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here's your script. - Thanks.</font>

433
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,238
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you okay? - What do you mean?</font>

434
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you not heard?</font>

435
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Heard about what?</font>

436
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll know when you read the script.</font>

437
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:50,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

438
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:57,968
<font color=#FFFF00>(Meesa Apparel)</font>

439
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:01,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Bankruptcy finalised?</font>

440
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:08,868
<font color=#FFFF00>The last commercial's on.</font>

441
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:12,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Up next.</font>

442
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:15,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Menswear brand Meesa Apparel...</font>

443
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:18,138
<font color=#FFFF00>was unable to repay their loans...</font>

444
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:20,738
<font color=#FFFF00>and their bankruptcy was finalised today.</font>

445
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:23,638
<font color=#FFFF00>According to the financial and fashion industry,</font>

446
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:26,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa should have repaid Woosung Bank before the 5th.</font>

447
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,368
<font color=#FFFF00>They owed the bank eight million and couldn't come up with the money.</font>

448
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:33,438
<font color=#FFFF00>This afternoon, their accounts were frozen...</font>

449
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:35,898
<font color=#FFFF00>and bankruptcy was announced.</font>

450
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,698
<font color=#FFFF00>The lengths are slightly different.</font>

451
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:52,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Ji, stop colouring in the face.</font>

452
00:30:53,238 --> 00:30:55,798
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a bit too dark...</font>

453
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,298
<font color=#FFFF00>and her expression's too rigid.</font>

454
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:00,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's fix that.</font>

455
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:06,938
<font color=#FFFF00>(Darling, Honey, My Love)</font>

456
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:12,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

457
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you in shock?</font>

458
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't think they'd actually go bankrupt.</font>

459
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I should do something.</font>

460
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:27,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I should meet with Dong Jin.</font>

461
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:34,338
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

462
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:38,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa Apparel's bankruptcy was just finalised.</font>

463
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,638
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I need you back.</font>

464
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:43,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't. I have a lot to deal with at my own store.</font>

465
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:46,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa's the only thing my father left behind.</font>

466
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:48,438
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't lose it to anyone else.</font>

467
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:50,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I left Meesa long ago.</font>

468
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You can deal with it.</font>

469
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:54,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no one left.</font>

470
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:56,098
<font color=#FFFF00>No one to trust.</font>

471
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:58,468
<font color=#FFFF00>It has to be you.</font>

472
00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:00,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a stranger now. Do you trust me?</font>

473
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,598
<font color=#FFFF00>We never got along as husband and wife...</font>

474
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:05,198
<font color=#FFFF00>but as a person you've never let me down.</font>

475
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:07,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you.</font>

476
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:10,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't answer right now. Give me time to think.</font>

477
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:28,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

478
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

479
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:42,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Help my family.</font>

480
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:46,298
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're talking about Meesa,</font>

481
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:48,168
<font color=#FFFF00>there's nothing I can do.</font>

482
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:52,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say no just like that. Help them out.</font>

483
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:53,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, please.</font>

484
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:58,338
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only person who can help Meesa out.</font>

485
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,538
<font color=#FFFF00>It took a lot of courage to come to me, but I'm sorry.</font>

486
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:05,338
<font color=#FFFF00>The bankruptcy's finalised.</font>

487
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:07,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't help.</font>

488
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:09,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What now?</font>

489
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:12,568
<font color=#FFFF00>My dad made it what it is from nothing.</font>

490
00:33:12,668 --> 00:33:14,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I have to watch it crumble?</font>

491
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Hyo Won.</font>

492
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,768
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing I can do.</font>

493
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:22,998
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so upsetting.</font>

494
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe...</font>

495
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:35,238
<font color=#FFFF00>this is a penalty.</font>

496
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:39,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin was an important part of Meesa.</font>

497
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:43,798
<font color=#FFFF00>As soon as Dad died my mum and Hyo Sang...</font>

498
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:47,168
<font color=#FFFF00>took his CEO position and did a lot of bad things.</font>

499
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:54,468
<font color=#FFFF00>All her life, Mum was ridiculed for being a mistress.</font>

500
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum had bitterness in her heart,</font>

501
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,168
<font color=#FFFF00>and Dad always compared...</font>

502
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang to Dong Jin.</font>

503
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,038
<font color=#FFFF00>So Hyo Sang held a grudge against him.</font>

504
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:12,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess that's why he made a mistake.</font>

505
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:15,538
<font color=#FFFF00>His emotions kept for a long time exploded.</font>

506
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:19,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though what they did was wrong,</font>

507
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,638
<font color=#FFFF00>they are your mum and brother.</font>

508
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,508
<font color=#FFFF00>Other people might blame them,</font>

509
00:34:27,938 --> 00:34:29,598
<font color=#FFFF00>but you shouldn't do so.</font>

510
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:33,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum is...</font>

511
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:36,508
<font color=#FFFF00>timid and easily moved to tears.</font>

512
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:40,398
<font color=#FFFF00>She must be very scared and upset by herself.</font>

513
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:46,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you should stay by her side.</font>

514
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go back home.</font>

515
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:59,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the only one who can protect Mum.</font>

516
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:08,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad you're here, Hyo Won.</font>

517
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:09,538
<font color=#FFFF00>How is Mum?</font>

518
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:12,838
<font color=#FFFF00>She's in her room. She is in shock,</font>

519
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:14,968
<font color=#FFFF00>so she's almost out of her mind.</font>

520
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,008
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

521
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:21,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum!</font>

522
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:24,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

523
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:27,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

524
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:29,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

525
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:35,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I was scared and exhausted.</font>

526
00:35:37,008 --> 00:35:40,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for coming back.</font>

527
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:44,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, I'm sorry.</font>

528
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:46,938
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my fault.</font>

529
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I even hit you.</font>

530
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:52,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

531
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:55,298
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my fault.</font>

532
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:57,898
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Mum. I'm sorry.</font>

533
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:13,138
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what shall I do?</font>

534
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:16,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang drove the company to ruin.</font>

535
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:20,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What shall I do?</font>

536
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Mum. Everything will be fine.</font>

537
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:27,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I put in everything I have...</font>

538
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:31,338
<font color=#FFFF00>to pay off the debt.</font>

539
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:34,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What will become of us?</font>

540
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:42,038
<font color=#FFFF00>What if we are forced out onto the streets...</font>

541
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:45,298
<font color=#FFFF00>without any money?</font>

542
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about it.</font>

543
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:50,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing a part-time job these days.</font>

544
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:53,008
<font color=#FFFF00>I can support you, so don't worry.</font>

545
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:58,938
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right.</font>

546
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:03,698
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. What shall I do?</font>

547
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:06,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right.</font>

548
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:12,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook, you must be tired. I can drive.</font>

549
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be tired singing all day.</font>

550
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:17,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I should drive since I'm your manager.</font>

551
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:19,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not tired.</font>

552
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:21,898
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

553
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:24,898
<font color=#FFFF00>is it all right that we lie?</font>

554
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:30,238
<font color=#FFFF00>We're married couple, but we say that we're cousins.</font>

555
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:32,698
<font color=#FFFF00>That's no big deal.</font>

556
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:36,338
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not going to lie forever. It's just until you go into orbit.</font>

557
00:37:36,398 --> 00:37:37,568
<font color=#FFFF00>It's going to be all right.</font>

558
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:39,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It's quite thrilling.</font>

559
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:42,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You're funny.</font>

560
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,938
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's Dad. - It is him.</font>

561
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he going to the park when it's cold?</font>

562
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:05,508
<font color=#FFFF00>- I don't know. - Is he taking a walk?</font>

563
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:10,738
<font color=#FFFF00>There he is.</font>

564
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:13,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait a minute, Dong Sook.</font>

565
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,508
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

566
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:23,368
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems that he's carrying a cane.</font>

567
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:25,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he carrying a cane?</font>

568
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:31,838
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he doing now?</font>

569
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,508
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been thinking that there's something strange.</font>

570
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:39,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Father has a problem with his eyes, Dong Sook.</font>

571
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:41,398
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

572
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:44,668
<font color=#FFFF00>The cane...</font>

573
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:49,698
<font color=#FFFF00>looks like the ones for the visually handicapped.</font>

574
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:52,968
<font color=#FFFF00>That's impossible.</font>

575
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:08,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

576
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:13,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. It's me, Dong Sook.</font>

577
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:21,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Dong Sook.</font>

578
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:25,438
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here. Can't you see me?</font>

579
00:39:46,268 --> 00:39:47,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook.</font>

580
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:50,038
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

581
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:53,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

582
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:02,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

583
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:09,538
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to you?</font>

584
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

585
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:27,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

586
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:30,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

587
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:48,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so surprised.</font>

588
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:51,298
<font color=#FFFF00>When people get old,</font>

589
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:55,898
<font color=#FFFF00>they get problems here or there.</font>

590
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:58,768
<font color=#FFFF00>In my case,</font>

591
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:01,368
<font color=#FFFF00>it was my eyes.</font>

592
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:05,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know that you were unwell.</font>

593
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:09,438
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't deserve to be your daughter.</font>

594
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry, Dad. - Don't say that.</font>

595
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,238
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a sweet daughter to me.</font>

596
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:19,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

597
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:23,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.</font>

598
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:27,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you'd be less shocked...</font>

599
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>once I get used to it myself.</font>

600
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have noticed.</font>

601
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:36,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Father.</font>

602
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:40,568
<font color=#FFFF00>People have...</font>

603
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,538
<font color=#FFFF00>their own little inconveniences to some extent.</font>

604
00:41:43,638 --> 00:41:45,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't complain about that.</font>

605
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:47,568
<font color=#FFFF00>That's life.</font>

606
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:50,268
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

607
00:41:50,698 --> 00:41:53,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I've seen my children make their own families.</font>

608
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:55,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no regrets.</font>

609
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:58,438
<font color=#FFFF00>What I'm sorry about is...</font>

610
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,838
<font color=#FFFF00>that I can't watch Da Jeong get married...</font>

611
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:04,638
<font color=#FFFF00>with my own eyes.</font>

612
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:08,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, I'm sorry...</font>

613
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,638
<font color=#FFFF00>that I can't care for Dong Jin's baby later.</font>

614
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:15,298
<font color=#FFFF00>My poor dad!</font>

615
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,768
<font color=#FFFF00>That's life.</font>

616
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:25,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't go as I planned.</font>

617
00:42:25,598 --> 00:42:27,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!</font>

618
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,008
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying.</font>

619
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:48,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why are you so drunk? - Stop it.</font>

620
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:58,568
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you drink in a situation like this?</font>

621
00:42:58,598 --> 00:43:00,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you in a right mind or not?</font>

622
00:43:00,638 --> 00:43:02,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I got drunk...</font>

623
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:06,768
<font color=#FFFF00>because I'm in a situation like this, Mum.</font>

624
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:10,938
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I stand it on a day like this if I don't drink?</font>

625
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:14,238
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you answer back to me? You idiot!</font>

626
00:43:14,598 --> 00:43:15,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Mum.</font>

627
00:43:15,798 --> 00:43:18,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad devoted his lifetime to make the company grow.</font>

628
00:43:18,368 --> 00:43:21,968
<font color=#FFFF00>You drove it to ruin in less than a year. I can't believe it.</font>

629
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to do well.</font>

630
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,268
<font color=#FFFF00>While Dad was alive...</font>

631
00:43:27,598 --> 00:43:30,568
<font color=#FFFF00>he called me "Idiot!", "Fool!".</font>

632
00:43:31,368 --> 00:43:32,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Those words...</font>

633
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:36,368
<font color=#FFFF00>pierced my heart.</font>

634
00:43:37,508 --> 00:43:39,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to succeed...</font>

635
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:44,298
<font color=#FFFF00>and prove that Dad underestimated me.</font>

636
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:45,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this...</font>

637
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:47,798
<font color=#FFFF00>what you wanted to do?</font>

638
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:49,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know things would turn out this way.</font>

639
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:52,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It's driving me crazy.</font>

640
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:53,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Hyo Sang.</font>

641
00:43:53,768 --> 00:43:56,538
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take him upstairs. - You idiot.</font>

642
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You fool.</font>

643
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:01,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- You... - I'm Min Hyo Sang, the CEO!</font>

644
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,938
<font color=#FFFF00>He has no right to mope.</font>

645
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:10,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Your brother was never CEO material.</font>

646
00:44:11,138 --> 00:44:12,798
<font color=#FFFF00>We should've let...</font>

647
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:15,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin manage the company like your dad wanted.</font>

648
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:18,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm reaping what I sowed. This is all on me.</font>

649
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:21,468
<font color=#FFFF00>What now?</font>

650
00:44:21,598 --> 00:44:23,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you get it?</font>

651
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:27,238
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Hyo Sang were out of your depth.</font>

652
00:44:27,238 --> 00:44:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You brought this upon us.</font>

653
00:44:30,138 --> 00:44:32,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You act like you don't care.</font>

654
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:35,038
<font color=#FFFF00>The company and our family's ruined.</font>

655
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,698
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you talk like that?</font>

656
00:44:36,698 --> 00:44:38,498
<font color=#FFFF00>It's none of my business.</font>

657
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:40,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Joo, how can you say that?</font>

658
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:43,038
<font color=#FFFF00>What else should I say?</font>

659
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:48,338
<font color=#FFFF00>You're reaping what you sowed.</font>

660
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Accept the price and pay it.</font>

661
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,138
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all you can do.</font>

662
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:59,068
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare she.</font>

663
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:01,868
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a viper!</font>

664
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:04,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You evil brat!</font>

665
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down before you faint again.</font>

666
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:08,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

667
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Poor me.</font>

668
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:19,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

669
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:23,898
<font color=#FFFF00>were you aware of Dad's condition?</font>

670
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:28,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out a while after he left home.</font>

671
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell us until now?</font>

672
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:34,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have told me if not anyone else.</font>

673
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:40,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Dong Sook,</font>

674
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,038
<font color=#FFFF00>but Dad told me not to.</font>

675
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:46,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you his son and I'm not his daughter?</font>

676
00:45:46,868 --> 00:45:49,368
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you not tell me about this?</font>

677
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:52,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook, calm down.</font>

678
00:45:52,338 --> 00:45:54,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad told him not to tell anyone.</font>

679
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so.</font>

680
00:45:57,038 --> 00:45:59,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his only daughter.</font>

681
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea he's going blind.</font>

682
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:06,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I whined about wanting to get married...</font>

683
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:09,238
<font color=#FFFF00>and grinned from ear to ear once I got married.</font>

684
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the worst daughter a man could ever have.</font>

685
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:21,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel just as bad as you do.</font>

686
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:28,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I only found out before you did.</font>

687
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,538
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing...</font>

688
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:32,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I could do for him.</font>

689
00:46:34,998 --> 00:46:36,968
<font color=#FFFF00>My poor dad.</font>

690
00:46:38,598 --> 00:46:40,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so sorry for him.</font>

691
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:45,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying. You cried so much in front of him earlier.</font>

692
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:47,938
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll drain yourself.</font>

693
00:46:48,498 --> 00:46:50,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there a cure or treatment?</font>

694
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:53,738
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

695
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Does your mum know?</font>

696
00:46:57,038 --> 00:47:00,468
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't. I know it'll be hard, but pretend that...</font>

697
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,468
<font color=#FFFF00>nothing's wrong for now.</font>

698
00:47:02,468 --> 00:47:05,638
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what Dad wants.</font>

699
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

700
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:14,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't cry around him.</font>

701
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:17,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll hold it in.</font>

702
00:47:40,668 --> 00:47:41,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see.</font>

703
00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:45,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Your fever's gone.</font>

704
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:48,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine now. How did the partnership signing go?</font>

705
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Very well, of course. But Yun Shil...</font>

706
00:47:53,398 --> 00:47:57,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook and Tae Pyung found out Dad's sick.</font>

707
00:47:58,298 --> 00:47:59,538
<font color=#FFFF00>How?</font>

708
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:03,198
<font color=#FFFF00>They happened to see him in a park...</font>

709
00:48:03,198 --> 00:48:06,498
<font color=#FFFF00>practicing how to use a walking stick.</font>

710
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:10,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Was Dong Sook very upset?</font>

711
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,138
<font color=#FFFF00>She cried a lot.</font>

712
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:17,168
<font color=#FFFF00>We agreed not to tell Mum for now. I thought you should know.</font>

713
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:18,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

714
00:48:19,538 --> 00:48:21,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get dinner ready. You should shower.</font>

715
00:48:37,268 --> 00:48:38,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

716
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:41,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I just heard from Dong Jin.</font>

717
00:48:43,668 --> 00:48:44,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

718
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,268
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen?</font>

719
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:52,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad was a tailor all his life.</font>

720
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:57,198
<font color=#FFFF00>He was happiest when he was making a suit.</font>

721
00:48:57,998 --> 00:49:00,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he to do without his eyesight?</font>

722
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:02,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Are they still cooking?</font>

723
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:07,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Is dinner ready?</font>

724
00:49:07,898 --> 00:49:09,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mother, it's almost done.</font>

725
00:49:12,698 --> 00:49:14,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong, Dong Sook?</font>

726
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:17,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing's wrong. There's something in my eye...</font>

727
00:49:17,898 --> 00:49:20,998
<font color=#FFFF00>and I just asked Yun Shil to blow it out.</font>

728
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:23,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you even here?</font>

729
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:26,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Go and rest and leave dinner to us.</font>

730
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:27,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like that.</font>

731
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:31,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Finally, I can relax while my daughter...</font>

732
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,738
<font color=#FFFF00>and daughter-in-law prepare my meals.</font>

733
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:36,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad's hungry, so move a bit faster.</font>

734
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,738
<font color=#FFFF00>We will.</font>

735
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:46,838
<font color=#FFFF00>What now?</font>

736
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:09,098
<font color=#FFFF00>You used to make up excuses to stay out of the kitchen.</font>

737
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:11,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Today, you volunteered to cook...</font>

738
00:50:11,938 --> 00:50:13,998
<font color=#FFFF00>and are helping your dad eat.</font>

739
00:50:13,998 --> 00:50:15,638
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the occasion?</font>

740
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:19,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook's acting like the perfect daughter.</font>

741
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:22,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

742
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:26,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I was a useless daughter who only caused you trouble.</font>

743
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,138
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

744
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:33,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you two fight?</font>

745
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:34,598
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Mother.</font>

746
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:38,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that she's married, I think she finally grew up.</font>

747
00:50:38,398 --> 00:50:41,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It's high time she did, I guess.</font>

748
00:50:44,568 --> 00:50:46,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you two argue about something?</font>

749
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:49,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

750
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:53,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, right.</font>

751
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You weren't feeling too well. How are you now?</font>

752
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel better now.</font>

753
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know that.</font>

754
00:51:14,198 --> 00:51:17,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I've felt that I'm in debt to you for 10 years.</font>

755
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:19,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to run away,</font>

756
00:51:20,768 --> 00:51:22,898
<font color=#FFFF00>but I've endured it all along.</font>

757
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:26,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it all because of your lie?</font>

758
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:30,338
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

759
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:34,668
<font color=#FFFF00>make such a lie?</font>

760
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:37,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

761
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:40,338
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't believe me,</font>

762
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:44,998
<font color=#FFFF00>but if it were to make you happy,</font>

763
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:48,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I could give you my heart, not just a kidney.</font>

764
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you trying to die?</font>

765
00:52:03,068 --> 00:52:05,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You're drinking right after leaving the hospital?</font>

766
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:07,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave me alone. I don't mind dying.</font>

767
00:52:07,968 --> 00:52:10,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather die than live without Yun Shil.</font>

768
00:52:11,068 --> 00:52:13,538
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you say that to me?</font>

769
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:15,668
<font color=#FFFF00>She registered her marriage with someone else.</font>

770
00:52:15,668 --> 00:52:17,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you care about her?</font>

771
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:20,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you please get over her?</font>

772
00:52:21,368 --> 00:52:22,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do now?</font>

773
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,298
<font color=#FFFF00>She won't want to see me now.</font>

774
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:27,538
<font color=#FFFF00>But then,</font>

775
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:30,838
<font color=#FFFF00>if I were her, I wouldn't be able to forgive me.</font>

776
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:33,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I deceived her for over 10 years.</font>

777
00:52:34,938 --> 00:52:38,038
<font color=#FFFF00>She must feel so angry and betrayed.</font>

778
00:52:38,038 --> 00:52:41,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? How did you deceive her?</font>

779
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:43,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have told her.</font>

780
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:47,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm such an idiot. I'm a moron.</font>

781
00:52:47,138 --> 00:52:50,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it. What got into you? What are you doing?</font>

782
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:51,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Get a grip.</font>

783
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:59,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't he tell Yun Shil?</font>

784
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought he'd go straight to her.</font>

785
00:53:02,298 --> 00:53:03,898
<font color=#FFFF00>What was he up to?</font>

786
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:07,138
<font color=#FFFF00>You aren't making any sense.</font>

787
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:08,738
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

788
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:11,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't give up. Not like this.</font>

789
00:53:12,538 --> 00:53:14,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather die...</font>

790
00:53:14,038 --> 00:53:16,468
<font color=#FFFF00>than let him take Yun Shil from me.</font>

791
00:53:19,098 --> 00:53:21,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care now.</font>

792
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I should both take our own lives.</font>

793
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:42,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You were still a student then.</font>

794
00:53:43,268 --> 00:53:46,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad's death alone was shocking enough.</font>

795
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:49,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you ever blame yourself.</font>

796
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:52,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let him control me like a child.</font>

797
00:53:52,698 --> 00:53:54,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish that he suffers...</font>

798
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,098
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I wish he suffers more than I suffered.</font>

799
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,938
<font color=#FFFF00>- I... - I wish...</font>

800
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:02,538
<font color=#FFFF00>you wouldn't think like that.</font>

801
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:06,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you hate him for what he did?</font>

802
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:08,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Why wouldn't I?</font>

803
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:10,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Just thinking of what he did to you...</font>

804
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:13,398
<font color=#FFFF00>still makes my blood boil.</font>

805
00:54:15,038 --> 00:54:16,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why do you want me to forgive him?</font>

806
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,638
<font color=#FFFF00>If you spend your life hating him,</font>

807
00:54:20,568 --> 00:54:23,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it'll only make your life difficult.</font>

808
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:25,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how there's the saying,</font>

809
00:54:25,668 --> 00:54:27,998
<font color=#FFFF00>"The greatest revenge is indifference."</font>

810
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:31,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish you would take revenge the same way.</font>

811
00:54:42,468 --> 00:54:45,568
<font color=#FFFF00>The two of you seem quiet tonight.</font>

812
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:50,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not in the mood. - Why? What's wrong?</font>

813
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:54,198
<font color=#FFFF00>No. It's nothing.</font>

814
00:54:58,338 --> 00:54:59,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen?</font>

815
00:55:01,438 --> 00:55:02,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Have they worn out already?</font>

816
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Bae Sam Do.</font>

817
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Get a hold of yourself. With a body like that,</font>

818
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:14,038
<font color=#FFFF00>you should be able to stand up to your wife.</font>

819
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:24,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go take a cold shower,</font>

820
00:55:25,038 --> 00:55:27,868
<font color=#FFFF00>and then I'll dance the night away with Sun Nyeo.</font>

821
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:50,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Put away the table and spread the bedding.</font>

822
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:54,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Not tonight. I have work to finish. You go ahead and sleep.</font>

823
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Bae Sam Do is fully prepared.</font>

824
00:55:57,238 --> 00:55:58,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's dance the night away.</font>

825
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough with the nonsense.</font>

826
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:05,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Nonsense? Did you just say I'm talking nonsense?</font>

827
00:56:06,668 --> 00:56:08,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you...</font>

828
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:11,938
<font color=#FFFF00>actually think I'd fall for your word three times?</font>

829
00:56:11,998 --> 00:56:14,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop bothering me and just go to sleep.</font>

830
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:17,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Things were different then. Are you ignoring me?</font>

831
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:19,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

832
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:22,168
<font color=#FFFF00>If a lady says she doesn't want to be bothered,</font>

833
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:25,068
<font color=#FFFF00>a man should behave and listen. Why are you being so aggressive?</font>

834
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:30,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to spend some time with you, Honey.</font>

835
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:34,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm busy with work. You go to bed. I can't get anything done here.</font>

836
00:56:34,868 --> 00:56:37,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, wait. It's been a long time.</font>

837
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:43,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Has she gone crazy?</font>

838
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she rejecting me?</font>

839
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

840
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:01,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have to go to work?</font>

841
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:04,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a program scheduled for this evening. I'll be leaving later.</font>

842
00:57:05,098 --> 00:57:06,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh dear. My headaches.</font>

843

<font color=#FFFF00>Oh dear.</font>

845
00:57:18,638 --> 00:57:21,668
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who is it this early? - Madam Ko,</font>

846
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:24,298
<font color=#FFFF00>People from the court are here.</font>

847
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:27,198
<font color=#FFFF00>They said it would be obstruction of justice if I don't open the door,</font>

848
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:29,138
<font color=#FFFF00>so I let them in.</font>

849
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:32,538
<font color=#FFFF00>People from the court?</font>

850
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,238
<font color=#FFFF00>We will proceed a provisional seizure of corporeal property.</font>

851
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:46,238
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? What gives you the right?</font>

852
00:57:46,238 --> 00:57:49,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Woosung Bank has requested that we proceed a provisional seizure...</font>

853
00:57:49,998 --> 00:57:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>of the corporeal property Mr Min has secured. Let's begin.</font>

854
00:57:53,038 --> 00:57:55,468
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, Sir. - Goodness.</font>

883
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:45,938
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is it, Ji Yun? - Something's happened.</font>

884
00:59:45,938 --> 00:59:48,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is it this time? - Bailiffs from the court are here.</font>

885
00:59:48,898 --> 00:59:51,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- There are stickers everywhere. - What?</font>

886
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:56,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I've succeeded, haven't I? My picture's in the papers.</font>

887
00:59:56,368 --> 00:59:59,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder who these men are. They sure are handsome.</font>

888
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:01,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- I agree. - CEO Lee.</font>

889
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:04,398
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I keep this newspaper? - Of course.</font>

890
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:06,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to show this to my wife.</font>

891
01:00:07,298 --> 01:00:10,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I get the feeling she's ignoring me and looking down on me these days.</font>

892
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:13,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to prove to her how successful I am.</font>

893
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:15,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would Sun Nyeo look down on you?</font>

894
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:17,638
<font color=#FFFF00>She has started working.</font>

895
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:20,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that she's earning money, she's started to walk all over me.</font>

896
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:22,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Mrs Bok wouldn't do that.</font>

897
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:24,538
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. She's not that type.</font>

898
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:27,168
<font color=#FFFF00>No one would know until they see it.</font>

899
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:30,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go show this to my wife and have lunch with her.</font>

900
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You do that, Sam Do.</font>

901
01:00:38,598 --> 01:00:39,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Try this.</font>

902
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,138
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

903
01:00:46,168 --> 01:00:48,138
<font color=#FFFF00>It just melts in your mouth.</font>

904
01:00:48,198 --> 01:00:51,138
<font color=#FFFF00>The base of this sauce here was passed down from...</font>

905
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:52,868
<font color=#FFFF00>my great-grandmother.</font>

906
01:00:52,868 --> 01:00:55,198
<font color=#FFFF00>- I added my specially-made sauce. - I see.</font>

907
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:57,898
<font color=#FFFF00>This was a hit at Daejeon Jungang Market.</font>

908
01:00:57,998 --> 01:01:00,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to say. I'm so grateful...</font>

909
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:02,698
<font color=#FFFF00>that I can learn such a valuable secret recipe.</font>

910
01:01:03,098 --> 01:01:05,998
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're that grateful, you could entrust me with your bank work.</font>

911
01:01:05,998 --> 01:01:07,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course I will.</font>

912
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:10,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we open an account right away?</font>

913
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:12,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, indeed. - Thank you.</font>

914
01:01:12,598 --> 01:01:14,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Have another drumstick.</font>

915
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,238
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have it. You worked so hard making this sauce.</font>

916
01:01:17,368 --> 01:01:20,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure I heard that she works in this market.</font>

917
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Try it with this sauce.</font>

918
01:01:26,238 --> 01:01:28,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh dear. You got some sauce on your cheek.</font>

919
01:01:28,538 --> 01:01:30,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that woman doing over there?</font>

920
01:01:32,038 --> 01:01:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I got more sauce on your face.</font>

921
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:01,638
<font color=#FFFF00>You scum. What do you think you're doing?</font>

922
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,698
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you hit on another man's wife?</font>

923
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:05,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you, Mister?</font>

924
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:07,098
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing to my client?</font>

925
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You should just go on doing your job.</font>

926
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:12,598
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you hit on my wife by feeding her chicken? You scum.</font>

927
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:13,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- Scum? - There's been a misunderstanding.</font>

928
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:17,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's a client at our bank. - What? A misunderstanding?</font>

929
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:18,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw everything over there.</font>

930
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,898
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you hit on my wife with your cheesy moves?</font>

931
01:02:20,898 --> 01:02:24,468
<font color=#FFFF00>- You won't get away with this. - Honey. Stop!</font>

932
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:30,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here, you scum. I'll teach you a lesson.</font>

933
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:33,038
<font color=#FFFF00>- You won't get away with this. - Oh dear. Oh dear.</font>

934
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:35,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll break my neck. Be careful. My head!</font>

935
01:02:35,998 --> 01:02:37,838
<font color=#FFFF00>- My head, my head. Ouch! - My head, my head. Ouch!</font>

936
01:02:37,938 --> 01:02:40,168
<font color=#FFFF00>- I told you to stop, didn't I? - Wait. Ouch.</font>

937
01:02:40,168 --> 01:02:41,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Wait! Let go! - Ouch!</font>

938
01:02:46,398 --> 01:02:48,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you lost your mind?</font>

939
01:02:48,438 --> 01:02:52,438
<font color=#FFFF00>In financial banking, gaining trust is essential. You made a scene.</font>

940
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,898
<font color=#FFFF00>The market is my workplace. What would they think of me?</font>

941
01:02:55,198 --> 01:02:57,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think they'd be able to trust me with their money?</font>

942
01:02:58,438 --> 01:03:02,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you feed a stranger chicken in the first place?</font>

943
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,838
<font color=#FFFF00>That was nothing. I was just doing my job.</font>

944
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You've changed.</font>

945
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:14,698
<font color=#FFFF00>After starting work, you've been pushing me away and ignoring me.</font>

946
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:18,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Before it's too late, you should go see a doctor.</font>

947
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:22,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Did I get hurt? I don't see any blood.</font>

948
01:03:25,738 --> 01:03:27,438
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go to a mental hospital.</font>

949
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:30,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you've come down with a severe case of delusional jealousy.</font>

950
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:32,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - This is exactly why...</font>

951
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:35,368
<font color=#FFFF00>similar people should get married in order not to have any trouble.</font>

952
01:03:35,538 --> 01:03:37,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You were way over your head.</font>

953
01:03:37,668 --> 01:03:39,868
<font color=#FFFF00>You met such an amazing woman like me...</font>

954
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:42,498
<font color=#FFFF00>that you can't live a day without being anxious.</font>

955
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:45,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You're in a chronic and habitual state of mind.</font>

956
01:03:58,098 --> 01:03:59,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You're late.</font>

957
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:01,598
<font color=#FFFF00>The janggi match lasted a while.</font>

958
01:04:01,598 --> 01:04:03,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you bet over lunch?</font>

959
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:05,568
<font color=#FFFF00>As usual.</font>

960
01:04:06,038 --> 01:04:07,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm tired.</font>

961
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:19,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are his shoes so dirty?</font>

962
01:04:41,438 --> 01:04:42,898
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

963
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:02,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Was the janggi game that tiring?</font>

964
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:05,598
<font color=#FFFF00>He never used to take a nap.</font>

965
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:15,298
<font color=#FFFF00>He should hang up his coat.</font>

966
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:21,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he win money playing janggi?</font>

967
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:22,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it so heavy?</font>

968
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:30,398
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

969
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:34,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a stick.</font>

970
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:39,638
<font color=#FFFF00>This looks like the one that blind people use.</font>

971
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:20,738
<font color=#FFFF00>(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

972
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:23,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? Why do you have it?</font>

973
01:06:23,798 --> 01:06:24,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have a drink?</font>

974
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:26,898
<font color=#FFFF00>People who work sometimes drink.</font>

975
01:06:26,898 --> 01:06:28,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the problem?</font>

976
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:32,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe these stickers are in my own house.</font>

977
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:36,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Did the bank take all your assets as collateral?</font>

978
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:38,138
<font color=#FFFF00>- They called a board meeting. - How did it go?</font>

979
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go to Anseong.</font>

980
01:06:39,568 --> 01:06:41,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasted 10 years of my life,</font>

981
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,738
<font color=#FFFF00>but I decided to get over it and move on.</font>

982
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:47,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll see if there's a way to make up for the lost 10 years.</font>
