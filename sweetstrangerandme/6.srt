00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,067
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

158
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,837
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Who are all these people?</font>

159
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:13,007
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - Little Brother,</font>

160
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,667
<font color="yellow">please help me.</font>

161
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,907
<font color="yellow">Little Brother...</font>

162
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,467
<font color="yellow">- Go. Go inside. - Why?</font>

163
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,567
<font color="yellow">- Little Brother. - My feet won't move.</font>

164
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,667
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - Go.</font>

165
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,537
<font color="yellow">- She said not to even go near her. - Little Brother.</font>

166
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,967
<font color="yellow">Little Brother!</font>

167
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:35,067
<font color="yellow">While resting here, I felt good like this clear water.</font>

168
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:38,337
<font color="yellow">I thought, maybe this is why people go to suburbs.</font>

169
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:42,667
<font color="yellow">However, thanks to you,</font>

170
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,807
<font color="yellow">I feel like this now.</font>

171
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:50,467
<font color="yellow">I'm showing you since you seem to be dull.</font>

172
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:55,637
<font color="yellow">Stop making my life into a mess and drink this.</font>

173
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,607
<font color="yellow">Must I drink this?</font>

174
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,467
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll drink it.</font>

175
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:10,907
<font color="yellow">If that will make you feel better, I will.</font>

176
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:12,967
<font color="yellow">Stop acting.</font>

177
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:15,207
<font color="yellow">It's arrowroot juice.</font>

178
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,367
<font color="yellow">I feel bad to the juice for comparing it to my life.</font>

179
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,367
<font color="yellow">Apparently, it's good for hangovers.</font>

180
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:22,037
<font color="yellow">Leave after you drink it.</font>

181
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,337
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin will transfer to the Hong Kong head office.</font>

182
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:35,067
<font color="yellow">When I go with him after marriage, I won't bother you.</font>

183
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,707
<font color="yellow">We won't ever run into each other.</font>

184
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:39,007
<font color="yellow">Then you should just move to Hong Kong quietly.</font>

185
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:40,607
<font color="yellow">It's fine with me,</font>

186
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:45,537
<font color="yellow">but Dong Jin is scared of being seen as the bad guy.</font>

187
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:47,137
<font color="yellow">You must know that already.</font>

188
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,137
<font color="yellow">Know what? I don't know anything about him.</font>

189
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:52,667
<font color="yellow">I don't want to lose Dong Jin.</font>

190
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,067
<font color="yellow">Please. Just act as if we're on good terms.</font>

191
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:59,067
<font color="yellow">I don't have friends, and I'm a loner at work now.</font>

192
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,137
<font color="yellow">What if no one comes to my wedding?</font>

193
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,507
<font color="yellow">I respect your nerve.</font>

194
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:07,237
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this because of your wedding?</font>

195
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,667
<font color="yellow">It's a once in a lifetime event.</font>

196
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,637
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what an eggplant flower looks like?</font>

197
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:23,207
<font color="yellow">A flower this small grows up to be this big.</font>

198
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,367
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about time you grow up, too?</font>

199
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,267
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

200
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,837
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, do you know what my strength is?</font>

201
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,337
<font color="yellow">I have no pride.</font>

202
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,967
<font color="yellow">I'll wait for you outside.</font>

203
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:50,937
<font color="yellow">Who does she think she is?</font>

204
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,307
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come out, too?</font>

205
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,107
<font color="yellow">This meeting involves you, too.</font>

206
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,467
<font color="yellow">If you sign, the development will start right away.</font>

207
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,167
<font color="yellow">Seulgi Supermarket's owner isn't here.</font>

208
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,067
<font color="yellow">She said she will sign if you do.</font>

209
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,437
<font color="yellow">The restaurant will be auctioned anyway.</font>

210
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,707
<font color="yellow">I don't want to buy it from Da Da at a high price.</font>

211
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,637
<font color="yellow">Why don't we help each other out?</font>

212
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,637
<font color="yellow">Fine, but only under one condition.</font>

213
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,307
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

214
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,837
<font color="yellow">Keep the lake and the forest.</font>

215
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:27,937
<font color="yellow">Then I'm in.</font>

216
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:33,067
<font color="yellow">I guess you are not a good liar.</font>

217
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:38,437
<font color="yellow">Hey, Nan Gil, the one having his first love and crush.</font>

218
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:43,807
<font color="yellow">Why are you so obsessed with the lake and forest?</font>

219
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,567
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Na Ri.</font>

220
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,267
<font color="yellow">Are you staying here for good?</font>

221
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:57,137
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

222
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,907
<font color="yellow">Why did I come here?</font>

223
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,507
<font color="yellow">I can't remember why.</font>

224
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,267
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

225
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,737
<font color="yellow">Do you think she heard?</font>

226
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,937
<font color="yellow">Even if she did, she wouldn't know anything.</font>

227
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,437
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Ms. Kwon will leave the contract with you.</font>

228
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:16,467
<font color="yellow">This is business.</font>

229
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:20,307
<font color="yellow">Look at their faces filled with hope.</font>

230
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,507
<font color="yellow">Hey, Nan Gil, the one having his first love and crush.</font>

231
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:35,037
<font color="yellow">His first love and crush?</font>

232
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,907
<font color="yellow">Haven't we met?</font>

233
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,337
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

234
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,907
<font color="yellow">Do you live here?</font>

235
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,467
<font color="yellow">Well, yes. I think so.</font>

236
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,337
<font color="yellow">This perfume is good only for summer.</font>

237
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:16,837
<font color="yellow">I remember you now.</font>

238
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,937
<font color="yellow">You are the guy who was with Na Ri at the airport.</font>

239
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,507
<font color="yellow">Why do you still have the contract with you?</font>

240
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:31,467
<font color="yellow">Are you proving you are incompetent?</font>

241
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,567
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, I'm in front of your house. Please come out.</font>

242
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,777
<font color="yellow">Little Brother.</font>

243
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:53,007
<font color="yellow">Do you know how he and Na Ri know each other?</font>

244
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:55,777
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

245
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,837
<font color="yellow">There was one time...</font>

246
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:01,467
<font color="yellow">he and Na Ri were together at the airport.</font>

247
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,367
<font color="yellow">They seemed so close then.</font>

248
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,237
<font color="yellow">I guess she is keeping it a secret from you.</font>

249
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:21,807
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

250
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,207
<font color="yellow">Have a family meeting with this.</font>

251
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,867
<font color="yellow">Your stepfather would never...</font>

252
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,107
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

253
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,737
<font color="yellow">Don't take it. Give it back to him.</font>

254
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:31,967
<font color="yellow">You saw that, right?</font>

255
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,937
<font color="yellow">Your stepfather didn't even read the contract.</font>

256
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,837
<font color="yellow">Stepfather?</font>

257
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,067
<font color="yellow">Brother, why are you still here?</font>

258
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,807
<font color="yellow">Go inside and take care of the restaurant.</font>

259
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,067
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

260
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,937
<font color="yellow">I told you I would be out waiting.</font>

261
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,137
<font color="yellow">He's the guy at the airport, right?</font>

262
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:11,407
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell everyone that you are dating.</font>

263
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:17,537
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

264
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,507
<font color="yellow">You aren't even answering me.</font>

265
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,867
<font color="yellow">You admit that you are dating. Isn't that right?</font>

266
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,567
<font color="yellow">Fine, what do you want me to do?</font>

267
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:31,637
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2 and 3. Cheese.</font>

268
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,667
<font color="yellow">(Hong Dumplings)</font>

269
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,907
<font color="yellow">I'll upload this to the group chat.</font>

270
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,007
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want. Leave already.</font>

271
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,737
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2 and 3. Cheese.</font>

272
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:47,067
<font color="yellow">I hope you two work out.</font>

273
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,707
<font color="yellow">I don't think you are the generous type.</font>

274
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:54,067
<font color="yellow">I didn't introduce him.</font>

275
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,237
<font color="yellow">This is Kwon Duk Bong.</font>

276
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,307
<font color="yellow">He is the president of a robot museum in Seulgi-ri.</font>

277
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:01,807
<font color="yellow">He is one of the family members of Greenland.</font>

278
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:04,167
<font color="yellow">Well, goodbye.</font>

279
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,467
<font color="yellow">- Duk Bong, why don't we go inside? - "We"?</font>

280
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,507
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

281
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:11,207
<font color="yellow">Greenland?</font>

282
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:17,807
<font color="yellow">Did you look me up?</font>

283
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,367
<font color="yellow">I'm one of the family members of Greenland.</font>

284
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,067
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you're a snob.</font>

285
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,777
<font color="yellow">I didn't have to look it up. Everyone in town knows.</font>

286
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,967
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I thought I'd feel better, but I don't.</font>

287
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,007
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

288
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:34,507
<font color="yellow">You need to be worse when you deal with snobs.</font>

289
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:37,967
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

290
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:41,307
<font color="yellow">You said something at the restaurant.</font>

291
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:46,307
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

292
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,967
<font color="yellow">You're good at observing women. She's a snob.</font>

293
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,437
<font color="yellow">You looked like you wanted to say something.</font>

294
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:55,837
<font color="yellow">It's really nothing.</font>

295
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,007
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

296
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,837
<font color="yellow">Since we are all here together,</font>

297
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:24,067
<font color="yellow">why don't we discuss this like adults?</font>

298
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:27,737
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, are you afraid of your stepfather?</font>

299
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,707
<font color="yellow">If not, why can't you even read the contract?</font>

300
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,107
<font color="yellow">Do you know that you can claim this is your house?</font>

301
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,207
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

302
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,537
<font color="yellow">And you, Nan Gil.</font>

303
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,007
<font color="yellow">It's true that this house is under your name.</font>

304
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,567
<font color="yellow">But you can't just sell it as you wish.</font>

305
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,667
<font color="yellow">Na Ri can stop you from doing so.</font>

306
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:46,867
<font color="yellow">And are you uncomfortable being with your daughter?</font>

307
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:51,037
<font color="yellow">Are you doing your part as her stepfather?</font>

308
00:21:56,937 --> 00:21:58,267
<font color="yellow">This is frustrating.</font>

309
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:01,107
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

310
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,007
<font color="yellow">You two should seriously talk about it...</font>

311
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:08,137
<font color="yellow">as a family.</font>

312
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,137
<font color="yellow">You are family after all, aren't you?</font>

313
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:14,537
<font color="yellow">Families don't play hard to get.</font>

314
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,267
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't Nan Gil want to eat?</font>

315
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,767
<font color="yellow">He said he is sick of the soup.</font>

316
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,507
<font color="yellow">- He didn't say that. - He didn't say that.</font>

317
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:46,907
<font color="yellow">Traitors.</font>

318
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,667
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

319
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:20,967
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

320
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,207
<font color="yellow">Why are you avoiding her?</font>

321
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,067
<font color="yellow">Put on your uniform properly.</font>

322
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,207
<font color="yellow">My first guess is that you're uncomfortable around her.</font>

323
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:43,767
<font color="yellow">Second guess, you still have feelings for her.</font>

324
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:46,437
<font color="yellow">Third guess, you want her to miss you. Which one is it?</font>

325
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,667
<font color="yellow">I think Na Ri misses you.</font>

326
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:53,507
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

327
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,307
<font color="yellow">Why is he always angry at me?</font>

328
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:01,967
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

329
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,207
<font color="yellow">Let's see if you can avoid me here, too.</font>

330
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:40,667
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong came to the airport to talk about the land.</font>

331
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,067
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me that?</font>

332
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,907
<font color="yellow">You've been avoiding me ever since.</font>

333
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:49,707
<font color="yellow">I'm not close to him. I'm not taking his side.</font>

334
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,507
<font color="yellow">I don't care whether or not you sell the land.</font>

335
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:55,967
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you leaving? - Do you know how I feel?</font>

336
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,367
<font color="yellow">I know you've been drinking every afternoon.</font>

337
00:24:58,467 --> 00:24:59,807
<font color="yellow">Just leave, then.</font>

338
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:03,537
<font color="yellow">I drank with the elders because I missed Mom. So what?</font>

339
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,567
<font color="yellow">I regret it like crazy.</font>

340
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:10,067
<font color="yellow">I planned that stupid wedding for years,</font>

341
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:12,267
<font color="yellow">but I never once went on a trip with her.</font>

342
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,907
<font color="yellow">I'm a stewardess, so airfare is cheap, too.</font>

343
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,767
<font color="yellow">I must've been a terrible daughter.</font>

344
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:23,137
<font color="yellow">I'm the insect and the pig's toenail after all.</font>

345
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,407
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

346
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,267
<font color="yellow">Did you buy this to plant?</font>

347
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:03,467
<font color="yellow">Yes. I want to make this my land.</font>

348
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,607
<font color="yellow">I'm new, so I want to start with lettuce and peppers.</font>

349
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,907
<font color="yellow">- Don't sprinkle it like that! - Then how do I do it?</font>

350
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:20,267
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

351
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:24,707
<font color="yellow">A little at a time...</font>

352
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:26,307
<font color="yellow">And gently...</font>

353
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:36,367
<font color="yellow">Mother didn't go on a trip because she wanted to.</font>

354
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:39,067
<font color="yellow">This was her entire world.</font>

355
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,267
<font color="yellow">Regardless, I'm the insect.</font>

356
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:44,937
<font color="yellow">Seulgi Supermarket's owner's daughter took off...</font>

357
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,867
<font color="yellow">with all her money and never even called.</font>

358
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:49,607
<font color="yellow">How could Mom brag about you to her?</font>

359
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,837
<font color="yellow">What about pig's toenail?</font>

360
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,967
<font color="yellow">- It's because of me. - What was?</font>

361
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:59,107
<font color="yellow">I hated, envied and was jealous of her daughter, Na Ri,</font>

362
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:03,937
<font color="yellow">so she pretended to curse you to make me feel better.</font>

363
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,937
<font color="yellow">I'll ask again since you said you hated me.</font>

364
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,867
<font color="yellow">- The one who splashed me... - It wasn't me!</font>

365
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:17,367
<font color="yellow">Let's say it wasn't.</font>

366
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,067
<font color="yellow">I used to get hit with pebbles when I was little.</font>

367
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,067
<font color="yellow">Someone stuck gum on my shoe, too.</font>

368
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,807
<font color="yellow">- Was that you? - I've never once...</font>

369
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,467
<font color="yellow">done anything that childish in my life.</font>

370
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,867
<font color="yellow">- They did it because you were a brat. - Hey!</font>

371
00:27:30,437 --> 00:27:32,667
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be so rude to me.</font>

372
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,207
<font color="yellow">Will you let me keep this land?</font>

373
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,437
<font color="yellow">- Will you go to Seoul then? - Fine, I'll go!</font>

374
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:39,407
<font color="yellow">- I'm never coming back... - Here again?</font>

375
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,537
<font color="yellow">You say that all the time, but you come here too often.</font>

<font color="yellow">(1 year ago)</font>

377
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,567
<font color="yellow">- Hey, you. - Oh my gosh.</font>

378
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:21,737
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

379
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:37,067
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the punk there?</font>

380
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,937
<font color="yellow">- There. - That punk ruined my field.</font>

381
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:42,337
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

382
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:54,737
<font color="yellow">Hands.</font>

383
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:14,737
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

384
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:19,367
<font color="yellow">You assert your right to remain silent. Is that right?</font>

385
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:21,967
<font color="yellow">Then should I say I caught the perp who has been...</font>

386
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,267
<font color="yellow">breaking scarecrows and damaging farms?</font>

387
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,137
<font color="yellow">- They were annoying. - Who was?</font>

388
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,237
<font color="yellow">Those farm owners' kids.</font>

389
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,867
<font color="yellow">You transferred here, right? And they picked on you.</font>

390
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,367
<font color="yellow">Still, will you tear up all the farms here?</font>

391
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,367
<font color="yellow">They have dogs and cows, too.</font>

392
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,837
<font color="yellow">Can you kill them, too?</font>

393
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,967
<font color="yellow">- Are you crazy? - Rice is alive, too.</font>

394
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,667
<font color="yellow">Don't you see them grow?</font>

395
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:57,537
<font color="yellow">There are...</font>

396
00:29:57,807 --> 00:30:01,437
<font color="yellow">idiots who enjoy picking on others.</font>

397
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,637
<font color="yellow">They have no idea their lives are becoming garbage.</font>

398
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:08,867
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your emotions and time for those jerks.</font>

399
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:11,267
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

400
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:14,667
<font color="yellow">Hey, kid. I'll be watching.</font>

401

423

00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:09,637
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil, I need you to come here.</font>

471
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:11,677
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What is it?</font>

472
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,967
<font color="yellow">I'm at...</font>

473
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:15,767
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

474
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,537
<font color="yellow">Would you explain where we are?</font>

475
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:28,537
<font color="yellow">We're halfway down the road to Injung-ri by the field.</font>

476
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:29,837
<font color="yellow">Okay. Got it.</font>

477
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:36,677
<font color="yellow">Okay. This is his number.</font>

478
00:38:38,677 --> 00:38:39,677
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

479
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,807
<font color="yellow">Wait. Weren't you the one on the bike just now?</font>

480
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,837
<font color="yellow">Right? How could you drive...</font>

481
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,507
<font color="yellow">How could you ride your bike like that?</font>

482
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:53,707
<font color="yellow">You had plenty of room. Why did you come at me?</font>

483
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,207
<font color="yellow">I didn't go at you.</font>

484
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:57,037
<font color="yellow">You were completely oblivious,</font>

485
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:58,767
<font color="yellow">so I rang my bell to ask you to move.</font>

486
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,007
<font color="yellow">Where could I have moved to? You forced me here.</font>

487
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:11,567

<font color="yellow">I'll hold your arm. Lean on me.</font>

491

<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

492
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:20,367
<font color="yellow">You need to get to the hospital.</font>

493
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:21,807

00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:58,837
<font color="yellow">Where exactly does it hurt?</font>

502
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,367

536
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,607

<font color="yellow">Duk Shim, would you give me a hand?</font>

539
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:14,807
<font color="yellow">You did it on purpose, didn't you?</font>

540
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:18,937
<font color="yellow">You're rude as soon as the men leave.</font>

541
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,507
<font color="yellow">You're the one who sent those notes to Nan Gil,</font>

545
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:29,837

546
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,637
<font color="yellow">Your shoe size fits!</font>

547
00:42:32,137 --> 00:42:34,107
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Is it a middle school thing?</font>

548
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:35,407
<font color="yellow">I'm in high school.</font>

549
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:37,867
<font color="yellow">I rang my bell from behind.</font>

550
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:39,637
<font color="yellow">It's because you're old and unathletic.</font>

551
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:40,637
<font color="yellow">Old?</font>

552
00:42:44,237 --> 00:42:47,607
<font color="yellow">Locking me in the shed and this were both dangerous.</font>

553
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:49,177
<font color="yellow">Tell me why you did it.</font>

554
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:50,837
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I'll...</font>

555
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:55,437
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you're in school. I'll show no mercy.</font>

556
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:02,107
<font color="yellow">Latching onto another guy because you were dumped...</font>

557
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:03,907
<font color="yellow">is degrading to all women.</font>

558
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:05,967
<font color="yellow">And you flirt at my brother, too.</font>

559
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:07,677
<font color="yellow">You're a total player.</font>

560
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:11,037
<font color="yellow">If you made a mistake and registered your marriage,</font>

561
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:13,537
<font color="yellow">be cool and get a divorce!</font>

562
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:19,107
<font color="yellow">When do you ever study?</font>

563
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,567
<font color="yellow">- You dug all this up. - I saw.</font>

564
00:43:21,737 --> 00:43:23,067
<font color="yellow">You got your ex-boyfriend drunk...</font>

565
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,067
<font color="yellow">and fought with his new girlfriend who came to get him.</font>

566
00:43:25,177 --> 00:43:27,337
<font color="yellow">You came to my brother and acted like a girl.</font>

567
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:29,467
<font color="yellow">You talked about canceling a marriage.</font>

568
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:31,537
<font color="yellow">I would've given in if you had any of it right,</font>

569
00:43:31,537 --> 00:43:33,067
<font color="yellow">but you got it all wrong.</font>

570
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,967
<font color="yellow">Then what's your relationship with my Nan Gil?</font>

571
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:37,037
<font color="yellow">- Your Nan Gil? - That's right.</font>

572
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:40,407
<font color="yellow">Why are you latching onto him? You're so annoying.</font>

573
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:43,137
<font color="yellow">You should apologize for what you did to me.</font>

574
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:44,737
<font color="yellow">What? Annoying?</font>

575
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:47,937
<font color="yellow">Why is it so hard to get an apology in this society?</font>

576
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:50,937
<font color="yellow">Kwon Duk Shim. You messed with the wrong person.</font>

577
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,107
<font color="yellow">I won't let this go.</font>

578
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:54,637
<font color="yellow">I'm going to press charges and investigate.</font>

579
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:57,067
<font color="yellow">I warned you that I won't show mercy.</font>

580
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:01,967
<font color="yellow">You really didn't know she was my sister?</font>

581
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:04,737
<font color="yellow">That's right. It's hard not to notice things like that.</font>

582
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:05,837
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

583
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:08,307
<font color="yellow">She's my sister. What is there not to like?</font>

584
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:09,937
<font color="yellow">She's quiet and innocent,</font>

585
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:11,837
<font color="yellow">but you called her a juvenile delinquent.</font>

586
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:13,837
<font color="yellow">I have only one sister.</font>

587
00:44:13,837 --> 00:44:16,267
<font color="yellow">I don't have a quiet and innocent sister.</font>

588
00:44:16,937 --> 00:44:19,207
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil! Nan Gil!</font>

589
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:20,937
<font color="yellow">Call the police right this instant!</font>

590
00:44:21,037 --> 00:44:22,037
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

591
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:23,267
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

592
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,207
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

593
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,367
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

594
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,537
<font color="yellow">No, I...</font>

595
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,767
<font color="yellow">Why are you making a kid get on her knees?</font>

596
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:38,867
<font color="yellow">She didn't mean it.</font>

597
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:40,267
<font color="yellow">- She meant it. - She meant it.</font>

598
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,437
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

599
00:44:42,907 --> 00:44:45,637
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to her to find out why,</font>

600
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,437
<font color="yellow">but she left without apologizing.</font>

601
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,167
<font color="yellow">Go to your sister.</font>

602
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:54,537
<font color="yellow">Okay, then... I'm sorry, Na Ri.</font>

603
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:55,637
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

604
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,837
<font color="yellow">- This is terrible. - What is?</font>

605
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:05,467
<font color="yellow">- Does everyone hate you? - Hey!</font>

606
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,237
<font color="yellow">She's an innocent kid. I wonder why she did that.</font>

607
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:10,137
<font color="yellow">You think she's quiet and innocent?</font>

608
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,137
<font color="yellow">She glared me down and said, "I rang the bell."</font>

609
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:16,467
<font color="yellow">"It's because you're old and unathletic."</font>

610
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:18,467
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

611
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:33,837
<font color="yellow">Do you know what emotion wastes the most energy?</font>

612
00:45:35,437 --> 00:45:38,537
<font color="yellow">First, a crush. Second, jealousy.</font>

613
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:42,537
<font color="yellow">So if you have a crush on someone, keep it a crush.</font>

614
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,337
<font color="yellow">If you add jealousy to a crush, you'll go crazy.</font>

<font color="yellow">Your energy will be depleted.</font>

616
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:49,207
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

617
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:51,507
<font color="yellow">You like her, don't you?</font>

618
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:54,237
<font color="yellow">Don't change the subject.</font>

619

00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,067

625
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:09,237
<font color="yellow">Player?</font>

626
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,467
<font color="yellow">Why is Na Ri a player?</font>

627
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:15,337
<font color="yellow">She won't give him a divorce but is playing other men.</font>

628
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:16,807
<font color="yellow">You should become a writer.</font>

629
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:20,237
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what Nan Gil and Na Ri are legally?</font>

630
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:23,107
<font color="yellow">I know about the request to cancel the marriage.</font>

631
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:25,667
<font color="yellow">They are parent and child. Stepdad and daughter.</font>

632
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:31,107
<font color="yellow">What stupidity is that?</font>

633
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:34,607
<font color="yellow">Is "stepdad and daughter" stupidity to you?</font>

634
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:38,867
<font color="yellow">- Let me out. - Am I your driver?</font>

635
00:46:38,907 --> 00:46:41,007
<font color="yellow">Let me out! Let me out!</font>

636
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,967
<font color="yellow">Let me out before I go even crazier!</font>

637
00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:05,407
<font color="yellow">Are you doing okay?</font>

638
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,837
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - We'll take another scan tomorrow...</font>

639
00:47:08,837 --> 00:47:10,367
<font color="yellow">and you can leave if it looks good.</font>

640
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:14,437
<font color="yellow">Exercise, so it doesn't become chronic. Walk some more.</font>

641
00:47:14,737 --> 00:47:16,867
<font color="yellow">- Please hold onto her and help her. - I will.</font>

642
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:28,837
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear him say to walk some more?</font>

643
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:34,637
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

644
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:38,967
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it strain my back if I walk too much?</font>

645
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,567
<font color="yellow">It hasn't even been 10 minutes.</font>

646
00:47:41,337 --> 00:47:43,007
<font color="yellow">What kind of dad are you?</font>

647
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:46,167
<font color="yellow">I never expected to nurse an old daughter, either.</font>

648
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:50,167
<font color="yellow">Should I look for my father?</font>

649
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:55,907
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Mom may be hurt if she heard this,</font>

650
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,867
<font color="yellow">but I didn't hate my father.</font>

651
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:01,067
<font color="yellow">The first time I rode the plane was with my father.</font>

652
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:04,307
<font color="yellow">I was too young to remember much,</font>

653
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,367
<font color="yellow">but I remember being shocked at how big it was.</font>

654
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,707
<font color="yellow">I wonder why Mom didn't go with us.</font>

655
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:16,807
<font color="yellow">Where did I go alone with my father? I wonder.</font>

656
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:21,537
<font color="yellow">It must not have been fun if you can't remember.</font>

657
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:25,707
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was. My father was pretty funny.</font>

658
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:28,607
<font color="yellow">Everyone in town liked him.</font>

659
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:32,067
<font color="yellow">But whenever I told my mom that,</font>

660
00:48:32,137 --> 00:48:35,267
<font color="yellow">she said I never flew with my dad...</font>

661
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,467
<font color="yellow">although I remember for certain.</font>

662
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:42,167
<font color="yellow">No. I rode an airplane with my father. I'm positive.</font>

663
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,937
<font color="yellow">Maybe Mom didn't like that you two went alone.</font>

664
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:48,367
<font color="yellow">You're right. That must be it.</font>

665
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,707
<font color="yellow">But you want to find your father to ask about that?</font>

666
00:48:52,107 --> 00:48:55,607
<font color="yellow">No. Mom kept many secrets from me.</font>

667
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,707
<font color="yellow">I realize that now.</font>

668
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:00,937
<font color="yellow">I want to ask what those secrets are.</font>

669
00:49:02,937 --> 00:49:04,137
<font color="yellow">Still, don't look for him.</font>

670
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:07,167
<font color="yellow">He's better off hiding from Da Da.</font>

671
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:11,207
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

672
00:49:14,507 --> 00:49:16,507
<font color="yellow">- Let's make 10 more laps. - Hey.</font>

673
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:21,167
<font color="yellow">Let's walk.</font>

674
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:27,807
<font color="yellow">While you were in your cave,</font>

675
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:31,667
<font color="yellow">I went to see Na Ri.</font>

676
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:35,767
<font color="yellow">I know. I saw the picture you sent.</font>

677
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:40,167
<font color="yellow">I talked a lot with her for two days...</font>

678
00:49:40,337 --> 00:49:41,967
<font color="yellow">and I feel better now.</font>

679
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:43,807
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

680
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,467
<font color="yellow">Is that all? Aren't you going to ask how she's doing?</font>

681
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:54,067
<font color="yellow">She's tough. I'm sure she's fine.</font>

682
00:49:55,137 --> 00:49:59,307
<font color="yellow">Luckily, she found herself a great guy there.</font>

683
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,337
<font color="yellow">A guy?</font>

684
00:50:04,907 --> 00:50:06,167
<font color="yellow">He isn't a guy.</font>

685
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,567
<font color="yellow">I heard you met Kwon Duk Bong...</font>

686
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,267
<font color="yellow">when you went there, too.</font>

687
00:50:15,837 --> 00:50:17,767
<font color="yellow">Kwon Duk Bong?</font>

688
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:22,237
<font color="yellow">Did you know he was from the Greenland family?</font>

689
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:27,107
<font color="yellow">She claims he's a friend,</font>

690
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,637
<font color="yellow">but he came to the airport, too.</font>

691
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:32,867
<font color="yellow">It looked like they've been together for a while.</font>

692
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:36,837
<font color="yellow">She may have cheated first.</font>

693
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,167
<font color="yellow">You have nowhere to return to.</font>

694
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,767
<font color="yellow">Who said I was going back?</font>

695
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,167
<font color="yellow">But Na Ri...</font>

696
00:50:46,237 --> 00:50:48,967
<font color="yellow">isn't the type to cheat.</font>

697
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:52,907
<font color="yellow">If she says he's a friend, he is a friend.</font>

698
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:59,007
<font color="yellow">Do you know me as well as you know her?</font>

699
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:02,367
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I've been feeling?</font>

700
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:06,167
<font color="yellow">I've been an outcast for stealing her man...</font>

701
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:09,137
<font color="yellow">and been getting night shifts.</font>

702
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,537
<font color="yellow">But I didn't let on, did I?</font>

703
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,937
<font color="yellow">You seem like the old Do Yeo Joo today.</font>

704
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:21,367
<font color="yellow">The first day we met, you came over that night...</font>

705
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:24,067
<font color="yellow">saying you couldn't get me out of your mind.</font>

706
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:27,867
<font color="yellow">You always said what you wanted.</font>

707
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:30,337
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about Na Ri from now on.</font>

708
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:33,307
<font color="yellow">You don't need to send me pictures like that.</font>

709
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:36,707
<font color="yellow">You are you, Yeo Joo. Okay?</font>

710
00:51:42,537 --> 00:51:46,907
<font color="yellow">I must have been acting like Na Ri to impress you...</font>

712
