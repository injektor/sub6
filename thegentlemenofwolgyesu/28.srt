<font color="yellow">He's cold and cautious.</font>

158
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,568
<font color="yellow">He can't be seeing someone already.</font>

159
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,838
<font color="yellow">No, I'm getting a weird feeling.</font>

160
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:46,098
<font color="yellow">He didn't seem...</font>

161
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:48,698
<font color="yellow">to have even an ounce of regret about what happened.</font>

162
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:50,368
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

163
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:55,698
<font color="yellow">Do you regret getting divorced?</font>

164
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:57,438
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

165
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:59,898
<font color="yellow">Why would I regret it? What's there to regret about?</font>

166
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,568
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you have any regrets.</font>

167
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,198
<font color="yellow">I'll try talking to him in person.</font>

168
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:06,838
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything useless.</font>

169
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:08,468
<font color="yellow">I might go crazy.</font>

170
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,798
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious. You're being ridiculous.</font>

171
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:16,738
<font color="yellow">You can't find someone like Dong Jin.</font>

172
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,668
<font color="yellow">You signed those divorce papers too thoughtlessly.</font>

173
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:33,568
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me, Hyo Won.</font>

174
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:36,268
<font color="yellow">What is this about? This video call is making me uncomfortable.</font>

175
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,398
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to hang up. - If you hang up,</font>

176
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:39,838
<font color="yellow">I'll run away from home again.</font>

177
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:43,098
<font color="yellow">You're using that to threaten me every single time.</font>

178
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:44,598
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?</font>

179
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,538
<font color="yellow">I just took a shower.</font>

180
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:50,098
<font color="yellow">- Then what will you do from now on? - I'm going to put on my skin toner.</font>

181
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,168
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead and do it. - Sorry?</font>

182
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:55,668
<font color="yellow">I wanted to know how you'd apply your toner.</font>

183
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,638
<font color="yellow">So don't mind me and go ahead.</font>

184
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,468
<font color="yellow">Why are you curious about such random things?</font>

185
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:01,198
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

186
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:19,338
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, you look cool even when you're doing that.</font>

187
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,538
<font color="yellow">You can be a model for skincare products.</font>

188
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:24,998
<font color="yellow">We're good now, right? Bye.</font>

189
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:25,998
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

190
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,168
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

191
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:30,098
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

192
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:33,098
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do a few push-ups before going to bed.</font>

193
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,338
<font color="yellow">- Have a good night, then. - That's perfect.</font>

194
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:37,698
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a countdown and say, "Start."</font>

195
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:39,868
<font color="yellow">- All right, one... - What are you doing now?</font>

196
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,068
<font color="yellow">Start now.</font>

197
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:42,438
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

198
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,338
<font color="yellow">I won't bug you after this.</font>

199
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:48,038
<font color="yellow">Just do this for me as one last favour. Please?</font>

200
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,168
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

201
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:50,868
<font color="yellow">This is the last time.</font>

202
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,838
<font color="yellow">All right. One...</font>

203
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:04,438
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

204
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:07,868
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

205
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,598
<font color="yellow">Four.</font>

206
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:20,668
<font color="yellow">20, 21.</font>

207
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:23,798
<font color="yellow">22.</font>

208
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:25,038
<font color="yellow">What's this sound?</font>

209
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,038
<font color="yellow">23.</font>

210
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:30,498
<font color="yellow">24.</font>

211
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,968
<font color="yellow">Keep it up. You're almost there.</font>

212
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,598
<font color="yellow">All right. 25.</font>

213
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:38,098
<font color="yellow">26.</font>

214
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:40,898
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing right now?</font>

215
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:42,038
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

216
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:45,098
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kang Tae Yang.</font>

217
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:48,298
<font color="yellow">Why on earth are you topless right now?</font>

218
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,598
<font color="yellow">He's working out. Don't interrupt him.</font>

219
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,138
<font color="yellow">26.</font>

220
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,998
<font color="yellow">You're seriously a piece of work.</font>

221
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,898
<font color="yellow">I guess you're trying to seduce my daughter with your muscles.</font>

222
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,938
<font color="yellow">- Are you a gigolo or what? - Pardon me?</font>

223
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,098
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so rude to him?</font>

224
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:05,368
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

225
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,098
<font color="yellow">You said you are not interested in my daughter.</font>

226
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,238
<font color="yellow">How dare you get topless in front of her? You little...</font>

227
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:13,598
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that he's topless? Look.</font>

228
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,238
<font color="yellow">He's clearly wearing a top.</font>

229
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,238
<font color="yellow">- Look! - I'm angry, so just hang up!</font>

230
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,468
<font color="yellow">See you later, Tae Yang.</font>

231
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,668
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

232
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,968
<font color="yellow">He's wearing a top. Because of you, I couldn't watch...</font>

233
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:27,068
<font color="yellow">I'm so scatterbrained right now.</font>

234
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,368
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I fell for Ms Min's trick again.</font>

235
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,998
<font color="yellow">For some strange reason, I always end up doing what she asks for.</font>

236
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:46,698
<font color="yellow">What brings you here this late?</font>

237
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:49,098
<font color="yellow">You said you're working late today, so I thought I should stop by.</font>

238
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:52,138
<font color="yellow">I see. I was just about to call you.</font>

239
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,038
<font color="yellow">Have a seat. Let's sit down.</font>

240
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,568
<font color="yellow">I'm seriously so upset...</font>

241
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,398
<font color="yellow">because of your mother and Hyo Won.</font>

242
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,198
<font color="yellow">I don't even know how I got into that situation with them.</font>

243
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,368
<font color="yellow">They hate me, don't they?</font>

244
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,798
<font color="yellow">They'll open up to you soon.</font>

245
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,038
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

246
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:17,468
<font color="yellow">I'm actually more worried about Hyo Won.</font>

247
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,338
<font color="yellow">I hear you. I'm more worried about her, as well.</font>

248
00:16:22,268 --> 00:16:23,368
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which,</font>

249
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,898
<font color="yellow">can you think of a way for me to get closer to her?</font>

250
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:30,498
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. The situation has gotten pretty awkward.</font>

251
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:44,398
<font color="yellow">What's up, Dong Sook?</font>

252
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,368
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving this to me?</font>

253
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,098
<font color="yellow">Release your album first.</font>

254
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:54,938
<font color="yellow">I don't need that money urgently.</font>

255
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,638
<font color="yellow">No, I don't need this. Take it back.</font>

256
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:58,968
<font color="yellow">Don't be stubborn. Just listen to me.</font>

257
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:02,108
<font color="yellow">Stop performing at clubs and cabarets.</font>

258
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,668
<font color="yellow">- Release an album with this and... - If I want to release a new album,</font>

259
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,608
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do it on my own.</font>

260
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:09,568
<font color="yellow">I won't get help from other people.</font>

261
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,638
<font color="yellow">- Jun. - I've been regretting a lot.</font>

262
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,968
<font color="yellow">If I didn't get help from you back then,</font>

263
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,138
<font color="yellow">we didn't need to become this distant.</font>

264
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,838
<font color="yellow">I tried to rely on others to take the easy way and ruined everything.</font>

265
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:26,568
<font color="yellow">Whether I succeed or not, I won't depend on others any more.</font>

266
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:28,238
<font color="yellow">I'll figure it out on my own.</font>

267
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:32,568
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

268
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,498
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Hey, Dong Sook. It's me.</font>

269
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:39,068
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling again?</font>

270
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,568
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, you remember...</font>

271
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,068
<font color="yellow">the prenuptial agreement, right?</font>

272
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,938
<font color="yellow">I revised it. Check this out.</font>

273
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:46,138
<font color="yellow">You know that the living allowance was 2,000 dollars, right?</font>

274
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,938
<font color="yellow">I increased it to 2,500 dollars.</font>

275
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:52,838
<font color="yellow">Also, it said you won't get anything if you give birth to a girl, right?</font>

276
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,368
<font color="yellow">50,000 dollars!</font>

277
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:57,068
<font color="yellow">I increased it from 0 to 50,000 dollars.</font>

278
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,368
<font color="yellow">You must remember Section six about your family, too.</font>

279
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:02,868
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give them 300 dollars every month.</font>

280
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:03,968
<font color="yellow">I made these revisions.</font>

281
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:05,968
<font color="yellow">You know what? This means...</font>

282
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,138
<font color="yellow">that I made all the compromises I could.</font>

283
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:09,368
<font color="yellow">Don't make any compromises.</font>

284
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,738
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me? - I won't be signing that agreement,</font>

285
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:15,468
<font color="yellow">so you don't need to make compromises.</font>

286
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:18,738
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

287
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:21,568
<font color="yellow">Should I have increased it to 2,700 dollars?</font>

288
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:26,038
<font color="yellow">Did you and Mr Park have a fight?</font>

289
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:31,398
<font color="yellow">I'll be direct.</font>

290
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,638
<font color="yellow">If you say that you want to date me now,</font>

291
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:36,668
<font color="yellow">I'd definitely be interested.</font>

292
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:40,438
<font color="yellow">Do you want to date me?</font>

297
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,838
<font color="yellow">That's the last thing I can do for you.</font>

298
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:06,698
<font color="yellow">You're a coward.</font>

299
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:10,198
<font color="yellow">You're such a coward.</font>

300
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,108
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Mum?</font>

301
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:21,068
<font color="yellow">Did you have a fight with Tae Pyung?</font>

302
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:25,068
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset, Da Jeong.</font>

303
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,368
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

304
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,138
<font color="yellow">It was all for nothing.</font>

305

<font color="yellow">You'll be blessed.</font>

308
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:43,738
<font color="yellow">Let's hope so.</font>

309
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:44,798
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

310
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:46,168
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

311
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:48,798
<font color="yellow">Did you really forget that...</font>

312
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,998
<font color="yellow">you'd put the ticket in the sole of your shoe?</font>

313
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:54,438
<font color="yellow">Did you lie?</font>

314
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,838
<font color="yellow">I did not. I really forgot about it.</font>

315
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,138
<font color="yellow">How could you forget where you hid something?</font>

316
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:02,238
<font color="yellow">I just did.</font>

317
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,368
<font color="yellow">How could you forget something like that?</font>

318
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,498
<font color="yellow">You stressed me out so much over the past few weeks...</font>

319
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,138
<font color="yellow">that I almost lost my mind.</font>

320
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:10,638
<font color="yellow">So stop causing trouble.</font>

321
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,138
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

322
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:20,398
<font color="yellow">I was getting my bedsheets out.</font>

323
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:21,538
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

324
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:24,638
<font color="yellow">I just got back from a party at Sam Do's.</font>

325
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:27,668
<font color="yellow">Is he celebrating something?</font>

326
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:30,238
<font color="yellow">No, Tae Pyung is.</font>

327
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:33,538
<font color="yellow">He won the second prize in the lottery.</font>

328
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,868
<font color="yellow">Did he really?</font>

329
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:38,798
<font color="yellow">Yes. So we gathered for a drink to congratulate him.</font>

330
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,198
<font color="yellow">That's great news.</font>

331
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,038
<font color="yellow">He'd had a hard time after he got conned.</font>

332
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:46,108
<font color="yellow">He did. I'm happy for him.</font>

333
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:49,968
<font color="yellow">I'm envious. He must be so pleased.</font>

334
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,268
<font color="yellow">You won the lottery, too.</font>

335
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:54,108
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

336
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:58,138
<font color="yellow">You won me, Lee Dong Jin. I'm a lottery ticket, too.</font>

337
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:01,398
<font color="yellow">You're telling lame jokes again.</font>

338
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,338
<font color="yellow">- Do you want a hug? - What?</font>

339
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:06,368
<font color="yellow">If you want a hug, just say so.</font>

340
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:09,968
<font color="yellow">Don't beat around the bush and complain about my jokes.</font>

341
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,938
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should talk any more.</font>

342
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,998
<font color="yellow">- I'm hanging up. - Just a moment.</font>

343
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:19,998
<font color="yellow">We have a date at 2am. See you in my dreams.</font>

344
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,768
<font color="yellow">I'll hug you then.</font>

345
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:25,738
<font color="yellow">I really have to go. See you tomorrow.</font>

346
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:33,238
<font color="yellow">No one ever reacted to my jokes as warmly as she does.</font>

347
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:54,768
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

348
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:57,198
<font color="yellow">I was waiting to take you to work.</font>

349
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,898
<font color="yellow">I said I'd walk with Ms Geum.</font>

350
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,768
<font color="yellow">Are you ready, Yun Shil?</font>

351
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:12,338
<font color="yellow">Is she still sleeping?</font>

353
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,768
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Are you ready for work?</font>

354
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,868
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting outside the gate.</font>

355
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:36,538
<font color="yellow">I got up late. You can go ahead.</font>

356
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:38,368
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

357
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:44,098
<font color="yellow">Why was she whispering?</font>

358
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:46,168
<font color="yellow">Is there something wrong with her phone?</font>

359
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:57,368
<font color="yellow">Let's go the other way.</font>

360
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:05,998
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

361
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:10,238
<font color="yellow">I waited for you a while and my hands are cold.</font>

362
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,568
<font color="yellow">What if someone sees us?</font>

363
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,268
<font color="yellow">There's no one here.</font>

364
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,398
<font color="yellow">Do you want to brag that we're holding hands?</font>

365
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:33,638
<font color="yellow">- No. - It's too obvious if we walk apart.</font>

366
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:35,368
<font color="yellow">Stay close and natural.</font>

367
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:36,998
<font color="yellow">- Should I? - Come here.</font>

368
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:42,098
<font color="yellow">See? It's much better this way.</font>

369
00:23:50,498 --> 00:23:53,398
<font color="yellow">I feel uncomfortable. Can we not hold hands?</font>

370
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,398
<font color="yellow">I'll carry you if you keep complaining.</font>

371
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:59,298
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll keep quiet. Let's just walk.</font>

372

<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

373
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,468
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

374
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:24,238
<font color="yellow">You said Dong Jin would take you to see a doctor.</font>

375
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:26,998
<font color="yellow">I have to go somewhere before my appointment.</font>

376

<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

377
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,368
<font color="yellow">To meet some friends.</font>

378
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,568
<font color="yellow">Which friends?</font>

379
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:34,838
<font color="yellow">It's not like you to keep prying.</font>

380
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:37,368
<font color="yellow">I think it's strange that you leave home...</font>

381
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:41,268
<font color="yellow">at the same time every day when you don't go to the store any more.</font>

382
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:43,298
<font color="yellow">Nothing's strange. I'm going for a walk.</font>

383
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:44,698
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

384
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:50,298
<font color="yellow">Is he going somewhere?</font>

<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

394
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:20,898

<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

397
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:39,768
<font color="yellow">Is he sick?</font>

400
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,438

403
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:19,868
<font color="yellow">This is called a stylus...</font>

404
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,868
<font color="yellow">and you use it to write braille.</font>

405
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:25,138
<font color="yellow">Hold it like this and press down to punch holes.</font>

406
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:36,298
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

407
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:38,898
<font color="yellow">What's he doing in there?</font>

408
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:43,538
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

409
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:46,538

<font color="yellow">who became or will become blind.</font>

414
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,238

418
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:20,938
<font color="yellow">I'm not able to talk to you right now.</font>

419
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:23,098
<font color="yellow">Let's talk when I get to work.</font>

420
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:27,598
<font color="yellow">Is he losing his sight? How is that possible?</font>

421
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:29,838
<font color="yellow">You did very well today.</font>

422
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:32,338

<font color="yellow">That's what I'd like to ask you.</font>

426
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,468
<font color="yellow">You left home...</font>

427
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:51,768
<font color="yellow">to take some time to settle things down for your condition.</font>

428
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:57,238
<font color="yellow">I had no idea even if I called myself as your best pupil.</font>

429
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,138
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

430
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,438
<font color="yellow">Don't be.</font>

431
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:05,198

<font color="yellow">I never strayed from my road...</font>

433
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:10,798
<font color="yellow">during my life as a tailor.</font>

434
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:12,998
<font color="yellow">That makes me a happy man.</font>

435
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:17,098
<font color="yellow">- Master. - Many people have died...</font>

436
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:19,268
<font color="yellow">but I'm still here, alive and well.</font>

437
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,698
<font color="yellow">I have a trustworthy pupil like you,</font>

438
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:28,498
<font color="yellow">and my son inherited the business so my ancestors will be proud.</font>

439
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:30,998
<font color="yellow">What could beat that?</font>

440
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:32,368
<font color="yellow">You were alone.</font>

441
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:36,098
<font color="yellow">You must have felt so lost.</font>

442
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:41,568
<font color="yellow">My heart breaks for you.</font>

443
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,838
<font color="yellow">I think this is a huge gift.</font>

444
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:48,568
<font color="yellow">I was given a chance to sort things out...</font>

445
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:50,998
<font color="yellow">and as you can see,</font>

446
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:55,838
<font color="yellow">I was given time to get used to what will come next.</font>

447
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:58,438
<font color="yellow">From now on...</font>

448
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,738
<font color="yellow">I will take better care of you.</font>

449
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,138
<font color="yellow">I was too indifferent.</font>

450
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:05,598
<font color="yellow">I'm okay at the moment.</font>

451
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:10,038
<font color="yellow">I will tell my wife and Dong Jin when the time is right.</font>

452
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:12,968
<font color="yellow">Keep it from them until then.</font>

453
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,798
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin came across a report from the hospital,</font>

454
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,098
<font color="yellow">so he knows my condition.</font>

455
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:20,568
<font color="yellow">Master...</font>

456
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:22,298

00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,238
<font color="yellow">This is our new menu. Please give it a try.</font>

458

<font color="yellow">This soy sauce dressing...</font>

459
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:43,168
<font color="yellow">is handed down in the family from the mother of my grandmother.</font>

460
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,198
<font color="yellow">Addition to that, I mixed it with a special sauce of mine.</font>

461
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:47,938
<font color="yellow">- How do you like it? - It's good.</font>

462
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:49,838
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

463
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,838
<font color="yellow">I heard your chicken is tremendous.</font>

464
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:58,298
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

465
00:29:58,398 --> 00:29:59,838
<font color="yellow">We are coming back from the bank.</font>

466
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:02,738
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to be filthy rich?</font>

467
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:03,938
<font color="yellow">It's all because of you.</font>

468
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:05,898
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

469
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:08,598
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - It's your share of the money.</font>

470
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:12,138
<font color="yellow">It's not that much, but I want you to have it.</font>

471
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:16,798
<font color="yellow">Forget it. If Sam Do finds out about this, he'll scold me.</font>

472
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:20,868
<font color="yellow">It's really not much.</font>

473
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,798
<font color="yellow">- It's what Sung Jun wants. - That's right.</font>

474
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:25,568
<font color="yellow">When my second album comes out and sweeps the charts,</font>

475
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:28,268
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back again. So just keep this one.</font>

476
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:32,538
<font color="yellow">This isn't what I had in mind when I gave you the lottery ticket.</font>

477
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:48,838
<font color="yellow">I'll work hard...</font>

478
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:50,668
<font color="yellow">and pay back the rest of your money.</font>

479
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:55,098
<font color="yellow">Is that all you have to say to me?</font>

480
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:57,898
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

481
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:00,498
<font color="yellow">Pay back properly with interest.</font>

482
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:04,668
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook. You're here.</font>

483
00:31:04,768 --> 00:31:05,998
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

484
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,238
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - It's the prenuptial agreement.</font>

485
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:10,398
<font color="yellow">The corrected version.</font>

486
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:12,038
<font color="yellow">I said I'm not interested. Stop doing this.</font>

487
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,738
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, I know what has been bothering you.</font>

488
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,198
<font color="yellow">I talked to my lawyer and corrected them all.</font>

489
00:31:16,198 --> 00:31:18,138
<font color="yellow">All you need to do now is put your stamp on it.</font>

490
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:21,138
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you read it? - What are you talking about?</font>

491
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,568
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, you shouldn't do things like that so carelessly.</font>

492
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,368
<font color="yellow">What? It's none of your business.</font>

493
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:28,068
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business and get lost.</font>

494
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:32,138
<font color="yellow">I said I don't want to marry you with or without this agreement.</font>

495
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:33,668
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, I'll take a look.</font>

496
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,468
<font color="yellow">"Prenuptial Agreement"</font>

497
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,398
<font color="yellow">"The husband, Park Dae Sub, will control all financial matters."</font>

498
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,798
<font color="yellow">"Park Dae Sub has no obligations to support...</font>

499
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,968
<font color="yellow">"Lee Dong Sook's daughter Kim Da Jung."</font>

500
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:48,398
<font color="yellow">"In case of divorce, you will not request a division of assets."</font>

501
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,768
<font color="yellow">What kind of contract is this?</font>

502
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:53,138
<font color="yellow">Give it back.</font>

503
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,268
<font color="yellow">And stay out of this.</font>

504
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,338
<font color="yellow">You don't even deserve someone like Dong Sook.</font>

505
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:59,768
<font color="yellow">How dare you propose something like this to her?</font>

506
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,268
<font color="yellow">And you call yourself a man?</font>

507
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:04,138
<font color="yellow">You're irritating me. You have been bothering me.</font>

508
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,138
<font color="yellow">Just what exactly is your relationship with Dong Sook?</font>

509
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,738
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to interrupt everything I do?</font>

510
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:11,898
<font color="yellow">Let go of me before you hurt yourself.</font>

511
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:15,868
<font color="yellow">Okay. I did. So what?</font>

512
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:18,398
<font color="yellow">How dare you use violence on him?</font>

513
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:22,398
<font color="yellow">- Take that. - What was that, Dong Sook?</font>

514
00:32:22,598 --> 00:32:24,098
<font color="yellow">- Why are you doing this? - I'll knock some sense into you.</font>

515
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:26,768
<font color="yellow">- Why are you doing this? - You won't learn any other way.</font>

516
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,338
<font color="yellow">"Prenuptial Agreement"? It's more like "Slavery Agreement".</font>

517
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:32,798
<font color="yellow">I didn't let her go so she could be treated like this.</font>

518
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:44,068
<font color="yellow">- Oh, gosh. It hurts. - Don't you ever come see Dong Sook.</font>

519
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:45,768
<font color="yellow">That will be the last day of your life.</font>

520
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:49,798
<font color="yellow">What are you two trying to do on me?</font>

521
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:52,138
<font color="yellow">Get lost before I really hurt you.</font>

522
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:54,138
<font color="yellow">I'll go. I'm going.</font>

523
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:56,298
<font color="yellow">But one day, you'll regret this.</font>

524
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,368
<font color="yellow">My head.</font>

525
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:05,298
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Dong Sook?</font>

526
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:07,168
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

527
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,338
<font color="yellow">Did you mean what you just said?</font>

528
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:13,168
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

529
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:20,368
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

530
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:24,698
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking a step back? You should've proposed to me.</font>

531
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:42,268
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

532
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,868
<font color="yellow">Tell you what?</font>

533
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:46,198
<font color="yellow">That Mr Lee is sick.</font>

534
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:48,598
<font color="yellow">I was just at the community centre for the blind.</font>

535
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:51,338
<font color="yellow">He wanted to...</font>

536
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:52,968
<font color="yellow">keep it a secret for a while.</font>

537
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,868
<font color="yellow">But you should have told me.</font>

538
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:57,298
<font color="yellow">He said he'd tell you himself.</font>

539
00:33:57,968 --> 00:33:58,998
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

540
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:03,268
<font color="yellow">I can't even stay standing up.</font>

541
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:08,368
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

542
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,138
<font color="yellow">What happens now?</font>

543
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:12,138
<font color="yellow">For the time being,</font>

544
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,438
<font color="yellow">we should do as he says.</font>

545
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:17,598
<font color="yellow">He's a very composed man.</font>

546
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:22,198
<font color="yellow">When he's ready, he'll tell everyone else.</font>

547
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:24,938
<font color="yellow">Why can't I stop crying?</font>

548
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:29,538
<font color="yellow">My dad is a strong person.</font>

549
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:32,568
<font color="yellow">He took it very well.</font>

550
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,598
<font color="yellow">Let's just see how it goes for the time being.</font>

551
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:37,668
<font color="yellow">If he does lose his vision...</font>

552
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,968
<font color="yellow">and can't be without someone by his side,</font>

553
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:44,438
<font color="yellow">then we should help him.</font>

554
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:57,508
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me, Ms Choi.</font>

555
00:34:57,668 --> 00:34:59,898
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for your call.</font>

556
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:03,268
<font color="yellow">Did you look into where this old man goes everyday?</font>

557
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,968
<font color="yellow">I saw him playing go at a go club.</font>

558
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:07,368
<font color="yellow">- He plays go? - Yes.</font>

559
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:11,638
<font color="yellow">He plays money games with his friends, too.</font>

560
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:15,098
<font color="yellow">When he's hungry, he orders jjajangmyeon, too.</font>

561
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:18,598
<font color="yellow">Then he should've told me that. Why would he keep it a secret?</font>

562
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:19,598
<font color="yellow">He's been...</font>

563
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:22,938
<font color="yellow">working all his life.</font>

564
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:27,638
<font color="yellow">He must have not wanted you to think that he's idle.</font>

565
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,338
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

566
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:30,838
<font color="yellow">So Ms Choi...</font>

567
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:33,438
<font color="yellow">Don't worry at all.</font>

568
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,768
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't.</font>

569
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:38,838
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Goodbye, Ms Choi.</font>

570
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,768
<font color="yellow">Why would I think like that?</font>

571
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:47,738
<font color="yellow">You sacrificed you entire life working for family.</font>

572
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:50,268
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong about playing go?</font>

573
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:53,968
<font color="yellow">What a stubborn man he is.</font>

574
00:35:54,638 --> 00:35:55,668
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

575
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:10,008
<font color="yellow">- Are you really not going to work? - Why would I? I quit.</font>

576
00:36:10,898 --> 00:36:14,468
<font color="yellow">Why would you quit your job for someone like Tae Yang?</font>

577
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:19,338
<font color="yellow">It's not entirely about him.</font>

578
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,508
<font color="yellow">Do you know what they call me at the office?</font>

579
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:25,098
<font color="yellow">Princess Loner.</font>

580
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:26,898
<font color="yellow">Princess Loner? What does it mean?</font>

581
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:28,638
<font color="yellow">It means I don't have any friends.</font>

582
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:29,868
<font color="yellow">How dare they?</font>

583
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,538
<font color="yellow">Who would call my daughter like that?</font>

584
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,798
<font color="yellow">- Who said that? - Calm down.</font>

585
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:36,898
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I got that nickname?</font>

586
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:40,138
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm not social and don't have capabilities.</font>

587
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,838
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. I didn't get there by myself.</font>

588
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,468
<font color="yellow">The other employees don't think of me as a head of department.</font>

589
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,238
<font color="yellow">I think so, too.</font>

590
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,968
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won. - I never liked my job anyway.</font>

591
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,098
<font color="yellow">I wasn't cut out for it, too.</font>

592
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:56,798
<font color="yellow">- So stop expecting so much from me. - You mean to tell me...</font>

593
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:58,898
<font color="yellow">that you will keep seeing Kang Tae Yang...</font>

594
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,898
<font color="yellow">while being unemployed?</font>

595
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:03,698
<font color="yellow">I mean, marriage is the same as being employed.</font>

596
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:07,338
<font color="yellow">Get a grip, you fool.</font>

597
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,168
<font color="yellow">That hurt.</font>

598
00:37:10,868 --> 00:37:13,008
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to work there, you have to go study abroad.</font>

599
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:15,968
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - If you say yes,</font>

600
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,298
<font color="yellow">- I'll let you to date him. - What?</font>

601
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:20,698
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

602
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:24,668
<font color="yellow">This is the burger and coke you ordered. Thank you.</font>

603
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:34,838
<font color="yellow">Can you take my order?</font>

604
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:36,368
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

605
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,238
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was here?</font>

606
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:45,168
<font color="yellow">I know a person or two in your building.</font>

607
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,798
<font color="yellow">- What about your job? - I told you.</font>

608
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,098
<font color="yellow">I handed in my resignation.</font>

609
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:54,638
<font color="yellow">- What on earth are you doing? - What?</font>

610
00:37:57,398 --> 00:37:59,438
<font color="yellow">I'll have bulgogi burger and coffee.</font>

611
00:37:59,938 --> 00:38:01,068
<font color="yellow">Make that an americano, please.</font>

612
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,568
<font color="yellow">Bulgogi burger and coffee, coming right up.</font>

613
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,368
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

614
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:23,008
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

615
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:25,068
<font color="yellow">All the best!</font>

616
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,438
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

617
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,568
<font color="yellow">(Tony Burger)</font>

618
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:35,698
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

619
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:39,568
<font color="yellow">She's been sitting there all day.</font>

620
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:40,798
<font color="yellow">She's even sleeping now.</font>

621
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:42,598
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we do something about this?</font>

622
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,138
<font color="yellow">Ma'am?</font>

623
00:39:06,698 --> 00:39:08,938
<font color="yellow">You should leave if you're done with your food.</font>

624
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:10,968
<font color="yellow">I'm not done yet.</font>

625
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:12,698
<font color="yellow">I can eat some more.</font>

626
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:15,198
<font color="yellow">But you had so much already.</font>

627
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:18,138
<font color="yellow">I can still eat. No problem at all.</font>

628
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,338
<font color="yellow">Can you take my order?</font>

629
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:31,268
<font color="yellow">Stop eating. You might get sick.</font>

630
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:33,698
<font color="yellow">It's totally fine.</font>

631
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:35,738
<font color="yellow">I normally eat like a glutton.</font>

632
00:39:38,098 --> 00:39:40,298
<font color="yellow">Which one shall I get?</font>

633
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:44,398
<font color="yellow">I'll get a chicken burger. I'd like some orange juice, too.</font>

634
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:46,838
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

635
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:49,468
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

636
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:00,938
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

637
00:40:02,298 --> 00:40:03,668
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

638
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:08,198
<font color="yellow">I wanted to go home with you, so I've been waiting for you.</font>

639
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,638
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you doing here all day?</font>

640
00:40:10,638 --> 00:40:12,368
<font color="yellow">I saw you working...</font>

641
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:15,598
<font color="yellow">and had a filling meal, too. It was a pretty good day...</font>

642
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:20,338
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

643
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:24,568
<font color="yellow">Did I eat too much?</font>

644
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:26,598
<font color="yellow">I think I have indigestion.</font>

645
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:31,868
<font color="yellow">You kept eating. I knew this would happen.</font>

646
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:35,168
<font color="yellow">I feel like throwing up.</font>

647
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:42,938
<font color="yellow">Try to hold it. You cannot... Don't throw up, okay?</font>

648
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:48,508
<font color="yellow">This way. Let's go.</font>

649
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:53,638
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

650
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:21,568
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling all right?</font>

651
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:37,638
<font color="yellow">Good work, Sam Do.</font>

652
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:40,838
<font color="yellow">This one looks even better than the one you made for the competition.</font>

653
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:42,138
<font color="yellow">I agree, Master.</font>

654
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:46,038
<font color="yellow">The higher placement of the notched lapel makes it look very stylish.</font>

655
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:50,738
<font color="yellow">Definitely. This suit certainly looks different from other ones.</font>

656
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,238
<font color="yellow">It does. I'm sure Gianni will love it, too.</font>

657
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:56,168
<font color="yellow">You think so? Then shall we send it via express courier tomorrow?</font>

658
00:41:56,168 --> 00:41:58,768
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll take care of it as soon as I get to work tomorrow.</font>

659
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:00,768
<font color="yellow">Great. Let's call it a day, then.</font>

660
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,508
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin. - Yes.</font>

661
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:05,798
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling a little down. Do you want to go for soju with me?</font>

662
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:09,198
<font color="yellow">I'm actually meeting up with my university friends this evening.</font>

663
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:10,838
<font color="yellow">Really? Okay, then.</font>

664
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:14,668
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, let's grab food together before we head home.</font>

665
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,698
<font color="yellow">My husband is away on a business trip.</font>

666
00:42:19,138 --> 00:42:21,698
<font color="yellow">I'm supposed to meet up with Tae Yang for dinner.</font>

667
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:23,198
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

668
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:27,168
<font color="yellow">Then I should just go home and eat the leftover food.</font>

669
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:33,368
<font color="yellow">What are you guys doing? You should get ready to leave.</font>

670
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:34,868
<font color="yellow">- Right. - Yes, Master.</font>

671
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,198
<font color="yellow">- Have you been waiting long? - No, I just got here.</font>

672
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:55,868
<font color="yellow">Here. Give me your hand.</font>

673
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:04,268
<font color="yellow">It's so cold.</font>

674
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:09,938
<font color="yellow">There we go.</font>

675
00:43:12,668 --> 00:43:16,598
<font color="yellow">It looks like Sam Do has a lot on his mind because of my dad.</font>

676
00:43:18,468 --> 00:43:22,768
<font color="yellow">So it's just a matter of time before your family finds out.</font>

677
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:24,868
<font color="yellow">I'm worried.</font>

678
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:28,898
<font color="yellow">If Ms Choi finds out about it, she'll be so shocked.</font>

679
00:43:29,968 --> 00:43:32,638
<font color="yellow">We'll get through it. We'll console and support each other.</font>

680
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:38,768
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that I might be adding to your stress.</font>

681
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:44,068
<font color="yellow">This is our very first date.</font>

682
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:48,668
<font color="yellow">Let's try to talk about hopeful and happy things, okay?</font>

683
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:50,868
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

684
00:43:51,638 --> 00:43:55,768
<font color="yellow">Since it's our first date, I paid special attention to plan it.</font>

685
00:43:56,498 --> 00:43:59,368
<font color="yellow">First, we'll have Italian food accompanied by wine for dinner.</font>

686
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:01,438
<font color="yellow">Then we'll have some tea at a place with a great night view.</font>

687
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,938
<font color="yellow">And we'll end the night by watching a film together. What do you think?</font>

688
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:07,568
<font color="yellow">Do you want to do all of those things in one night?</font>

689
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:10,538
<font color="yellow">As you know, I'm quite capable. Don't you worry.</font>

690
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:12,838
<font color="yellow">We don't need to do fancy things.</font>

691
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:15,968
<font color="yellow">Let's just go for a bowl of warm noodles.</font>

692
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:17,698
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so not romantic.</font>

693
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:20,898
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten how special today is? It's...</font>

694
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:25,368
<font color="yellow">our first day together as a couple.</font>

695
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:28,368
<font color="yellow">We eat those noodles every day. It's not special enough for today.</font>

696
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:33,498
<font color="yellow">You don't need to do anything. I'll take care of everything.</font>

697
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:35,168
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and just come with me.</font>

698
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:36,768
<font color="yellow">Wait, where are we going now?</font>

699
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:37,938
<font color="yellow">The first destination.</font>

700
00:44:37,938 --> 00:44:41,038
<font color="yellow">We're going to have Italian food with wine for dinner.</font>

701
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:54,238
<font color="yellow">This is my place.</font>

702
00:44:54,638 --> 00:44:58,138
<font color="yellow">Yes. We're going to have Italian food and wine...</font>

703
00:44:58,498 --> 00:45:00,298
<font color="yellow">right here at your place.</font>

704
00:45:00,938 --> 00:45:03,238
<font color="yellow">The ingredients are already here.</font>

705
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:05,938
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

706
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:09,298
<font color="yellow">The salad and pasta. Okay.</font>

707
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:12,598
<font color="yellow">- Open the door for me. - Sorry?</font>

708
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:14,898
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

709
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:49,568
<font color="yellow">By the way, is this the only apron you have?</font>

710
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:54,468
<font color="yellow">Can I give you a hand with anything?</font>

711
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:55,538
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry.</font>

712
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:58,398
<font color="yellow">Just relax and chill in your room.</font>

713
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,738
<font color="yellow">I'll chop the onions for you at least.</font>

714
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:06,438
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'll take care of everything. Just go inside and rest.</font>

715
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:08,398
<font color="yellow">I have so much to do.</font>

716
00:46:08,938 --> 00:46:11,698
<font color="yellow">I think I smell something burning.</font>

717
00:46:12,438 --> 00:46:14,098
<font color="yellow">Isn't it the meat on the frying pan?</font>

718
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:17,838
<font color="yellow">Goodness, I said I got this. Don't you worry. Just go inside.</font>

719
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:19,198
<font color="yellow">Don't come out.</font>

720
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,598
<font color="yellow">I must not burn it.</font>

721
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:29,368
<font color="yellow">What should I do next? Right. The spaghetti.</font>

722
00:46:36,938 --> 00:46:37,968
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

723
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,198
<font color="yellow">Dinner is ready. Come out.</font>

724
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,268
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

725
00:46:48,668 --> 00:46:50,198
<font color="yellow">Did you make all these by yourself, Mr Lee...</font>

726
00:46:51,438 --> 00:46:53,268
<font color="yellow">I mean Dong Jin. Did you really make all of these dishes?</font>

727
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,898
<font color="yellow">I didn't have enough time to put 100 percent of my skills,</font>

728
00:46:57,538 --> 00:46:59,298
<font color="yellow">but it won't taste bad.</font>

729
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:02,068
<font color="yellow">I'm impressed.</font>

730
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:03,268
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

731
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:09,338
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's start with the wine.</font>

732
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:11,398
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Here.</font>

733
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:16,768
<font color="yellow">We have to use these mugs because you don't have any wine glasses.</font>

734
00:47:23,668 --> 00:47:24,698
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

735
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:26,098
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

736
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:31,068
<font color="yellow">There aren't that many dishes, but I hope you enjoy everything.</font>

737
00:47:31,198 --> 00:47:33,198
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

738
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:50,768
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Does it taste bad?</font>

739
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:53,598
<font color="yellow">I think the steak is burnt.</font>

740
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:57,668
<font color="yellow">That's weird. I let just the outside burn slightly to give it a taste.</font>

741
00:48:01,768 --> 00:48:03,368
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is it so burnt?</font>

742
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:06,798
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I prefer well done.</font>

743
00:48:06,798 --> 00:48:10,268
<font color="yellow">No, no. Don't eat the steak. Try this spaghetti instead, okay?</font>

744
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:14,568
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second. Let me try it first.</font>

745
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:21,768
<font color="yellow">The noodles are all soggy.</font>

746
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:24,498
<font color="yellow">It's all right. I like soggy noodles.</font>

747
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,038
<font color="yellow">Do you have any instant noodles by any chance?</font>

748
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:31,038
<font color="yellow">I'm really good at making instant noodles.</font>

749
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:42,538
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

750
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:45,998
<font color="yellow">I made a little mistake earlier,</font>

751
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:48,698
<font color="yellow">but I guarantee that you won't be disappointed now.</font>

752
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:50,998
<font color="yellow">I prepared so much for this.</font>

753
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:54,698
<font color="yellow">I said we're going to watch a film. Do you remember?</font>

754
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:56,638
<font color="yellow">Are we going to watch a film here?</font>

755
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:58,198
<font color="yellow">That's right. We'll watch a film.</font>

756
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:01,198
<font color="yellow">Right here.</font>

757
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:09,538
<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

758
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,238
<font color="yellow">It's my favourite film, but I'm not sure if you'll like it or not.</font>

759
00:49:13,568 --> 00:49:15,738
<font color="yellow">I love this film, too.</font>

760
00:49:16,368 --> 00:49:19,638
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so relieved. This is a success, then.</font>

761
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:34,038
<font color="yellow">You're 10 times prettier...</font>

762
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,968
<font color="yellow">than Julia Roberts.</font>

763
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:37,868
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

764
00:49:37,868 --> 00:49:38,898
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

765
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,298
<font color="yellow">I don't tell lies.</font>

766
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:47,468
<font color="yellow">By the way, I think you look like that male character.</font>

767
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:49,338
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

768
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:53,698
<font color="yellow">I guess our eyes look similar.</font>

769
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:55,498
<font color="yellow">But don't you think...</font>

770
00:49:56,968 --> 00:49:59,038
<font color="yellow">my eyes are prettier?</font>

771
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:00,798
<font color="yellow">When I was at school,</font>

772
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,398
<font color="yellow">they called me Pretty Eyes.</font>

773
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:05,998
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you made me shiver.</font>

774
00:50:07,468 --> 00:50:10,138
<font color="yellow">Pull up the blanket, then.</font>

775
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:12,798
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Look at me.</font>

776
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:20,198
<font color="yellow">- What do you think? - No.</font>

777
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:28,038
<font color="yellow">What about now?</font>

778
00:50:28,038 --> 00:50:29,338
<font color="yellow">- Wait. - How is it?</font>

779
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:32,798
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

780
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:42,438
<font color="yellow">I'm home, Honey.</font>

781
00:50:42,538 --> 00:50:45,168
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me. I have to focus right now.</font>

782
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:48,638
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

783
00:50:50,168 --> 00:50:53,168
<font color="yellow">If Leather Jacket came in second, I can come in first.</font>

784
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:54,468
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

785
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:56,898
<font color="yellow">I gave it some thought.</font>

786
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:59,398
<font color="yellow">I can't just hand over my dream of a lifetime...</font>

787
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,538
<font color="yellow">to Leather Jacket.</font>

788
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:04,168
<font color="yellow">My lucky dream is still valid.</font>

789
00:51:05,168 --> 00:51:06,468
<font color="yellow">Look at these.</font>

790
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,268
<font color="yellow">How much do these cost?</font>

791
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,838
<font color="yellow">If I win the first prize, this will look like pocket change.</font>

792
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:12,668
<font color="yellow">You never stop surprising me.</font>

793
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,438
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - What was that?</font>

794
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:18,298
<font color="yellow">It's the method I invented.</font>

795
00:51:19,098 --> 00:51:22,068
<font color="yellow">Coming up with different series of numbers is hard.</font>

796
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:26,498
<font color="yellow">You're so smart when it comes to things like this.</font>

797
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:30,098
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

798
00:51:31,398 --> 00:51:32,968
<font color="yellow">- Are those your numbers? - Yes.</font>

799
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:34,898
<font color="yellow">Is anyone in there?</font>

800
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:36,998
<font color="yellow">- Is nobody in here? - Who's that?</font>

801
00:51:37,738 --> 00:51:38,938
<font color="yellow">Lee Dong Sook.</font>

802
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:41,698
<font color="yellow">Where is Lee Dong Sook?</font>

803
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:43,468
<font color="yellow">Come out here, Lee Dong Sook.</font>

804
00:51:44,498 --> 00:51:46,368
<font color="yellow">- That sounds like Mr Park. - Lee Dong Sook.</font>

805
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:48,798
<font color="yellow">What on earth does he think he's doing?</font>

806
00:51:51,668 --> 00:51:52,838
<font color="yellow">Lee Dong Sook.</font>

807
00:51:53,668 --> 00:51:55,438
<font color="yellow">Come out here!</font>

808
00:51:57,338 --> 00:51:58,498
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

809
00:52:00,098 --> 00:52:01,098
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

810
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:03,838
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

811
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:06,698
<font color="yellow">What brings you here without any notice?</font>

812
00:52:06,698 --> 00:52:08,398
<font color="yellow">Hello, mother-in-law.</font>

813
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:11,938
<font color="yellow">I came here to tell you something.</font>

814
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:14,138
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling a mother-in-law?</font>

815
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:15,738
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

816
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:18,938
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

817
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:23,168
<font color="yellow">I can't wrap my head around it.</font>

818
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:24,838
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

819
00:52:27,538 --> 00:52:29,468
<font color="yellow">I think you are drunk.</font>

820
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:32,798
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, come back when you're sober.</font>

821
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:34,038
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

822
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:37,438
<font color="yellow">I have to do this now...</font>

823
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,968
<font color="yellow">in front of everyone.</font>

824
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:47,298
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for? Come inside.</font>

825
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:51,738
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that guy?</font>

826
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:53,098
<font color="yellow">Did you two have a fight?</font>

827
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:55,368
<font color="yellow">He's a lunatic.</font>

828
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:57,138
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

829
00:52:58,068 --> 00:52:59,098
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

830
00:53:00,298 --> 00:53:02,098
<font color="yellow">Do you know what this is?</font>

831
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:04,568
<font color="yellow">This is the diamond ring...</font>

832
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:08,898
<font color="yellow">I got for Dong Sook.</font>

833
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:12,798
<font color="yellow">My goodness. It should be two-carat at least.</font>

834
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:15,738
<font color="yellow">That's right. It is two-carat diamond.</font>

835
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:17,798
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

836
00:53:17,898 --> 00:53:19,798
<font color="yellow">I didn't do something like this when I got married for the first time.</font>

837
00:53:20,098 --> 00:53:22,598
<font color="yellow">I made a big decision...</font>

838
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:26,068
<font color="yellow">to get this for Dong Sook.</font>

839
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:27,368
<font color="yellow">Why did you two fight?</font>

840
00:53:28,568 --> 00:53:29,638
<font color="yellow">We didn't.</font>

841
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:31,538
<font color="yellow">I just got...</font>

842
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:35,068
<font color="yellow">beaten up by them.</font>

843
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,798
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook and that nightclub singer who lives upstairs.</font>

844
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:38,938
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

845
00:53:39,168 --> 00:53:41,398
<font color="yellow">This is what they did to me.</font>

846
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:43,638
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

847
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,338
<font color="yellow">He deserved it.</font>

848
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:48,368
<font color="yellow">I deserved it?</font>

849
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:49,668
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

850
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:51,398
<font color="yellow">Look what I've got.</font>

851
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:54,698
<font color="yellow">All I asked for was her seal on this agreement.</font>

852
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,998
<font color="yellow">That's when they started beating me up.</font>

853
00:53:58,998 --> 00:53:59,998
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

854
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,438
<font color="yellow">- "Prenuptial Agreement"? - Let me see.</font>

855

867
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:37,068
<font color="yellow">How is that possible?</font>

868
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,168
<font color="yellow">I can't leave Da Jeong behind just to get married.</font>

869
00:54:42,568 --> 00:54:43,568
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

870
00:54:44,668 --> 00:54:46,868
<font color="yellow">It's not like I raised her.</font>

871
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:50,298
<font color="yellow">Why would I be obligated...</font>

872
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:52,268
<font color="yellow">to support a 20-year-old adult?</font>

873

<font color="yellow">She's an adult now.</font>

874
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:56,768
<font color="yellow">She should take care of herself.</font>

875
00:54:56,768 --> 00:54:57,838
<font color="yellow">So you're saying...</font>

876
00:54:58,768 --> 00:55:01,298
<font color="yellow">you'll marry my daughter,</font>

877
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:05,568
<font color="yellow">but will treat my granddaughter like a complete stranger?</font>

878
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:08,298
<font color="yellow">We wouldn't be complete strangers, but think about it.</font>

879
00:55:08,298 --> 00:55:10,498
<font color="yellow">What about when she decides to get married later?</font>

880
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:12,538
<font color="yellow">I'll have to pay for the wedding and everything.</font>

881
00:55:12,638 --> 00:55:15,798
<font color="yellow">That will be a lot of money.</font>

882
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:18,768
<font color="yellow">Why would I want something like that?</font>

883

<font color="yellow">You disgraceful jerk.</font>

884

<font color="yellow">Don't let someone like that get on your nerves.</font>

888
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:35,168
<font color="yellow">They say you never know the true human nature of someone.</font>

<font color="yellow">I can't leave with that ring.</font>

895
00:55:54,168 --> 00:55:55,898
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - Fine.</font>

896
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,498
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Get out of here.</font>

897
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:02,938
<font color="yellow">We'll take care of him.</font>

898
00:56:02,938 --> 00:56:04,668
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry, Mr Lee and Ms Choi.</font>

899
00:56:08,268 --> 00:56:09,468
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

900
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:12,768
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

901
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:14,738
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

902
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:19,038
<font color="yellow">I should have never forced you to get married to him.</font>

903
00:56:30,368 --> 00:56:32,368
<font color="yellow">You'll feel better since you took the pills.</font>

904
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:33,868
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt a lot?</font>

905
00:56:34,868 --> 00:56:36,538
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling better now.</font>

906
00:56:38,868 --> 00:56:40,868
<font color="yellow">Your tummy is too small to take all that food.</font>

907
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:42,868
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't eat so recklessly.</font>

908
00:56:45,498 --> 00:56:46,938
<font color="yellow">I did it because I was sorry.</font>

909
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:53,838
<font color="yellow">My brother fired you, so you had to start working part-time.</font>

910
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:55,568
<font color="yellow">I was sorry about that.</font>

911
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:58,638
<font color="yellow">I felt like I needed to help you.</font>

912
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:01,568
<font color="yellow">You had 5 hamburgers and 3 drinks in one sitting...</font>

915
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:13,238
<font color="yellow">I don't understand.</font>

916
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:14,538
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

917
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:16,638
<font color="yellow">Someone like you...</font>

918
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,668
<font color="yellow">should have rich and handsome men lined up for you.</font>

919
00:57:20,598 --> 00:57:23,368
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you want me so badly.</font>

920
00:57:24,468 --> 00:57:26,568
<font color="yellow">I thought it was because you're dumb.</font>

921
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,598
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

922
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:30,568
<font color="yellow">But you're not like that when it comes to other things.</font>

923
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:32,798
<font color="yellow">Or maybe,</font>

924
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:35,868
<font color="yellow">you're looking for an easy target who won't abandon you...</font>

925
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:40,838
<font color="yellow">after being heartbroken after a breakup.</font>

926
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:44,268
<font color="yellow">You're not easy.</font>

927
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:47,568
<font color="yellow">If I put in half as much effort as I did to you to other guys,</font>

928
00:57:48,338 --> 00:57:50,668
<font color="yellow">they would be all over me by now.</font>

929
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,198
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me, then?</font>

930
00:57:59,038 --> 00:58:00,068
<font color="yellow">You move my heart.</font>

931
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:09,598
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

932
00:58:12,038 --> 00:58:13,038
<font color="yellow">move my heart.</font>

933
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:17,698
<font color="yellow">I know I'll look stupid.</font>

934
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:21,468
<font color="yellow">I know you won't understand.</font>

935
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:25,498
<font color="yellow">But I don't want to be smart and calculative...</font>

936
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:27,768
<font color="yellow">when I'm with you.</font>

937
00:58:28,268 --> 00:58:29,598
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be like that.</font>

938
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:35,738
<font color="yellow">I want to show you who I really am.</font>

939
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:38,138
<font color="yellow">I just want to follow my heart...</font>

940
00:58:38,968 --> 00:58:40,838
<font color="yellow">without considering the consequences.</font>

941
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:52,798
<font color="yellow">I have faith that...</font>

942
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:55,568
<font color="yellow">you will accept me one day...</font>

943
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:58,038
<font color="yellow">as who I really am.</font>

944
00:58:59,968 --> 00:59:01,038
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

945
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:04,598
<font color="yellow">I don't know if you heard,</font>

946
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:07,438
<font color="yellow">but my mum...</font>

947
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:09,338
<font color="yellow">is a second wife.</font>

948
00:59:12,938 --> 00:59:15,738
<font color="yellow">She kicked out my dad's sick wife for his money...</font>

949
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:17,068
<font color="yellow">and took her spot.</font>

950
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:21,368
<font color="yellow">She was shunned by everyone ever since then.</font>

951
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:25,068
<font color="yellow">I didn't show it,</font>

952
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:27,968
<font color="yellow">but it was hard for me, too.</font>

953
00:59:30,898 --> 00:59:33,738
<font color="yellow">Kids teased me and bullied me...</font>

954
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,598
<font color="yellow">when I was in school.</font>

955
00:59:37,938 --> 00:59:41,368
<font color="yellow">The mum of a guy I met a few times when I was in college...</font>

956
00:59:42,998 --> 00:59:46,898
<font color="yellow">called to tell me to leave him because she didn't want...</font>

957
00:59:47,568 --> 00:59:49,738
<font color="yellow">her son to date the daughter of a mistress.</font>

958
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:53,698
<font color="yellow">Really? That's horrible.</font>

959
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:56,368
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

960
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:00,898
<font color="yellow">But things like that happened.</font>

961
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:06,998
<font color="yellow">I pretended to be okay,</font>

962
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,238
<font color="yellow">but I always felt intimidated.</font>

963
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:14,938
<font color="yellow">I was always concerned what others thought about me.</font>

964
01:00:16,998 --> 01:00:19,868
<font color="yellow">That's why I found it hard to make friends.</font>

965
01:00:22,738 --> 01:00:23,738
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

966
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:26,838
<font color="yellow">strangely enough, when I'm with you,</font>

967
01:00:27,738 --> 01:00:29,398
<font color="yellow">I let my guard down.</font>

968
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:32,298
<font color="yellow">I trust you...</font>

969
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:36,568
<font color="yellow">and I think you'll understand however stupidly I act.</font>

970
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:43,668
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault that my mum's a mistress.</font>

971
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:47,598
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault that you're poor.</font>

972
01:00:50,598 --> 01:00:51,698
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

973
01:00:52,738 --> 01:00:56,498
<font color="yellow">your conditions are of no concern to me.</font>

974
01:00:58,298 --> 01:01:00,368
<font color="yellow">We all lack something...</font>

975
01:01:01,668 --> 01:01:05,098
<font color="yellow">and if that's money, then that's actually a relief.</font>

976
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,068
<font color="yellow">I thought you were thoughtless.</font>

977
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,168
<font color="yellow">You actually had a lot to think about.</font>

978
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:17,298
<font color="yellow">Am I a goldfish? To have no thoughts?</font>

979
01:01:26,968 --> 01:01:28,098
<font color="yellow">That stank.</font>

980
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:34,338
<font color="yellow">I'm beginning to feel much better.</font>

981
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,568
<font color="yellow">You can't burp like that in public. You are a goldfish.</font>

982
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:46,098
<font color="yellow">Did you call me a goldfish?</font>

983
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:48,098
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

984
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,998
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything.</font>

985
01:01:53,238 --> 01:01:56,068
<font color="yellow">You called me a goldfish. I heard it loud and clear.</font>

986
01:01:58,768 --> 01:02:00,068
<font color="yellow">I'm not a goldfish.</font>

987
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:04,538
<font color="yellow">What else are you?</font>

988
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:06,498
<font color="yellow">Carry me.</font>

989
01:02:07,168 --> 01:02:08,938
<font color="yellow">I can't carry you.</font>

990
01:02:10,038 --> 01:02:12,238
<font color="yellow">My tummy's hurting again.</font>

991
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:14,868
<font color="yellow">Is it really?</font>

992
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,368
<font color="yellow">- Are you happy now? - Yes.</font>

993
01:02:24,668 --> 01:02:26,568
<font color="yellow">- Is your tummy okay? - Yes.</font>

994
01:02:27,898 --> 01:02:29,438
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure? - Yes.</font>

995
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:33,298
<font color="yellow">Good, then.</font>

996
01:02:47,538 --> 01:02:49,868
<font color="yellow">How was our first date?</font>

997
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:52,738
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget it forever.</font>

998
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:56,438
<font color="yellow">Mr Pretty Eyes.</font>

999
01:02:57,898 --> 01:02:59,568
<font color="yellow">I should go. It's getting cold.</font>

1000
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:00,998
<font color="yellow">I'll walk you to the door.</font>

1001
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:03,998
<font color="yellow">It was cold while watching a film. Go inside and warm up.</font>

1002
01:03:03,998 --> 01:03:06,268
<font color="yellow">- But still. - Go inside.</font>

1003
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:09,368
<font color="yellow">Walk safely back.</font>

1004
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:15,138
<font color="yellow">Bye, then.</font>

1005
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:17,468
<font color="yellow">Mr Pretty Eyes is out.</font>

1006
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:43,638
<font color="yellow">Who's here?</font>

1007
01:03:47,368 --> 01:03:50,838
<font color="yellow">What's the boss doing here so late at night?</font>

1008
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:53,068
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving after seeing Yun Shil.</font>

1009
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:56,768
<font color="yellow">What are you all doing here so late at night?</font>

1010
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:57,838
<font color="yellow">Us?</font>

1011
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,438
<font color="yellow">Our boss sent us.</font>

1012
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:02,838
<font color="yellow">I thought I warned you.</font>

1013
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:04,838
<font color="yellow">Stay away from his wife.</font>

1014
01:04:06,198 --> 01:04:08,498
<font color="yellow">You threaten and scare people.</font>

1015
01:04:08,998 --> 01:04:12,498
<font color="yellow">I know that's your thing, but it won't work with me.</font>

1016
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:13,768
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

1017
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:16,068
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

1018
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:18,998
<font color="yellow">Stay away from Yun Shil.</font>

1019
01:04:18,998 --> 01:04:22,868
<font color="yellow">If you keep bothering a powerless young lady, I will make you pay.</font>

1020
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:24,898
<font color="yellow">Are you actually challenging us?</font>

1021
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,568
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

1022
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,898
<font color="yellow">This is above our pay-grade.</font>

1023
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:32,068
<font color="yellow">Let's talk to the boss.</font>

1024
01:04:42,138 --> 01:04:43,398
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

1025
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:46,598
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you at work? Are you sick?</font>

1026
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:49,638
<font color="yellow">I'll come in a bit late. I have something to take care of.</font>

1027
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:51,098
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

1028
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:53,968
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, really. I'll tell you later.</font>

1029
01:04:54,738 --> 01:04:55,738
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Prison)</font>

1031
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:44,038
<font color="yellow">Hello there. You came sooner than I thought.</font>

1032
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:45,368
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Dong Jin.</font>

1033
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:47,638

<font color="yellow">(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

1035
01:06:34,268 --> 01:06:35,568
<font color="yellow">Are you dating?</font>

1036
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:37,568
<font color="yellow">Your expression changed recently.</font>

1037
01:06:37,568 --> 01:06:40,068
<font color="yellow">How could you turn your back on me like this?</font>

1038
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:41,938
<font color="yellow">I gave up everything for you.</font>

1039
01:06:41,938 --> 01:06:43,068
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

1040
01:06:43,068 --> 01:06:45,968
<font color="yellow">You can't step a foot out of your room without my permission.</font>

1041
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,768
<font color="yellow">This is illegal, Mum. I'll call the police.</font>

1042
01:06:48,768 --> 01:06:51,738
<font color="yellow">She hasn't called me once today. Is something wrong?</font>

1043
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:54,068
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid you'll get hurt.</font>

1044
01:06:54,068 --> 01:06:56,498
<font color="yellow">Both happiness and fear come from heart.</font>

1045
01:06:56,498 --> 01:06:57,738
<font color="yellow">So, focus on the happiness only.</font>
