71
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,950

75
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,110
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong? You look upset.</font>

76
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
<font color="yellow">Where's Sam Do?</font>

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,510
<font color="yellow">I think someone swapped the jacket that Sam Do made.</font>

78
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,980
<font color="yellow">They went to the office.</font>

79
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,510
<font color="yellow">The jacket got swapped? What are you talking about?</font>

80
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,550
<font color="yellow">Did you check the security footage?</font>

81
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,610
<font color="yellow">They were turned off.</font>

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,580
<font color="yellow">Something smells fishy.</font>

83
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,020
<font color="yellow">Someone did this in cahoots with the organiser.</font>

84
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,050
<font color="yellow">No one could have pulled this off unless it was planned by...</font>

85
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,980
<font color="yellow">someone who knows the procedures.</font>

86
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,180
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

87
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,020
<font color="yellow">Meesa's PR Team asked me to tape the competition.</font>

88
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,880
<font color="yellow">I set things up and then went back.</font>

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,380
<font color="yellow">That's right. You asked me to keep an eye on it, but I forgot.</font>

90
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,280
<font color="yellow">It should still be rolling.</font>

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,050
<font color="yellow">It might have caught something the security cameras didn't.</font>

92
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,110
<font color="yellow">Where is it? Let's check.</font>

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,110
<font color="yellow">This man...</font>

94
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know him?</font>

95
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,520
<font color="yellow">It's Mr Kim, one of Meesa Apparel's chief directors.</font>

96
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
<font color="yellow">He's Hyo Sang's right-hand man.</font>

97
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,980
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that Meesa Apparel stole my jacket?</font>

98
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,520
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,950
<font color="yellow">Can you send this to my email?</font>

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - My goodness.</font>

101
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,080
<font color="yellow">Did you take care of it?</font>

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,710
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee's team will be throwing a fit right about now.</font>

103
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,050
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

104
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,280
<font color="yellow">It's evidence of the theft you put Mr Kim up to.</font>

105
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,910
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

106
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,450
<font color="yellow">The rat's taking off.</font>

107
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,480
<font color="yellow">- Wait up. - Rats love to run.</font>

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,580
<font color="yellow">We're coming for you.</font>

109
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,350
<font color="yellow">Do you still fear me?</font>

110
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,580
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

111
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about it. Leave me out of it.</font>

112
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,110
<font color="yellow">Your childish bouts of jealousy...</font>

113
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,850
<font color="yellow">aren't even worth making a fuss about.</font>

114
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,810
<font color="yellow">Recuse yourself from the panel...</font>

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,780
<font color="yellow">and give back the jacket you stole.</font>

116
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,910
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

117
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,780
<font color="yellow">I said I know nothing.</font>

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,910
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

119
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,280
<font color="yellow">Then I'll hand this over to the competition organisers.</font>

120
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,980
<font color="yellow">Gianni Moravia will end up watching it.</font>

121
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,650
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, we caught the rat.</font>

122
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,780
<font color="yellow">- He had the jacket. - We got it back.</font>

123
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,980
<font color="yellow">Nothing's working out.</font>

124
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,880
<font color="yellow">- I didn't... - Be quiet.</font>

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know what he's been eating, but he's really heavy.</font>

126
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,950
<font color="yellow">What's he doing with them anyway?</font>

127
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,450
<font color="yellow">What should I do with this?</font>

128
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,380
<font color="yellow">I think we should do as you said.</font>

129
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,380
<font color="yellow">Someone who knows about suits should be on the judging panel.</font>

130
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,580
<font color="yellow">I'm just a businessman.</font>

131
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
<font color="yellow">I know nothing about suits.</font>

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,310
<font color="yellow">You found a new boyfriend.</font>

133
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,280
<font color="yellow">Why the long face?</font>

134
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,810
<font color="yellow">Would you want to date a man like him?</font>

135
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,750
<font color="yellow">I meet up with him because Mum wants me to,</font>

136
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,280
<font color="yellow">but it's so frustrating.</font>

137
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,680
<font color="yellow">- I can see why. - I envy you.</font>

138
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,510
<font color="yellow">You married Sam Do. What more could you want from a man?</font>

139
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,450
<font color="yellow">The grass is always greener on the other side.</font>

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,150
<font color="yellow">The weather is so beautiful.</font>

141
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,380
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

142
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,610
<font color="yellow">The sky's so blue.</font>

143
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,710
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get a job at a friend's clothes store starting today?</font>

144
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,550
<font color="yellow">I have to get going.</font>

145
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,450
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get a job frying chicken?</font>

146
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,410
<font color="yellow">I should get going, too.</font>

147
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,450
<font color="yellow">- I really don't want to go. - I really don't want to go.</font>

148
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,050
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

149
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,310
<font color="yellow">How about we go and have some fun?</font>

150
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,250
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

151
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,610
<font color="yellow">We didn't come here to look at cheap stuff.</font>

152
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
<font color="yellow">Let's go and see...</font>

153
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,380
<font color="yellow">what luxury brands look like.</font>

154
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,550
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

<font color="yellow">Get lost, all of you.</font>

462
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,080
<font color="yellow">The Bespoke Suit Fashion Show will begin shortly.</font>

463
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,850
<font color="yellow">This is being broadcast live via satellite to 23 countries.</font>

464
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,610
<font color="yellow">The tailor suit fashion show will begin shortly.</font>

465
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,550
<font color="yellow">This fashion show will be broadcast live by satellite in 23 countries.</font>

466
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,080
<font color="yellow">So now, let's give our undivided attention...</font>

467
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,710
<font color="yellow">to the work of master tailors representing Korea.</font>

468
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,680
<font color="yellow">We're the only amateurs among the professional models.</font>

469
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,950
<font color="yellow">What if we ruin the fashion show?</font>

470
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,750
<font color="yellow">Out of the four of us here, you look the most like a model.</font>

471
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,710
<font color="yellow">Are you sure we should do this?</font>

472
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,080
<font color="yellow">Yes. Anyone who can show off their suit the best is allowed...</font>

473
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,380
<font color="yellow">to walk on stage, even if he's not a professional model.</font>

474
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,280
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest.</font>

475
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,010
<font color="yellow">You, you and you.</font>

476
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,080
<font color="yellow">Your looks and my figure together...</font>

477
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,610
<font color="yellow">means we can take on any professional model.</font>

478
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,280
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

479
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,280
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3, turn.</font>

480
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,080
<font color="yellow">That's not your average walk.</font>

481
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,880
<font color="yellow">You're awesome.</font>

482
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,780
<font color="yellow">Have you done this before?</font>

483
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,980
<font color="yellow">You still don't believe me, do you?</font>

484
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,550
<font color="yellow">I used to be huge both on stage and off.</font>

485
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,610
<font color="yellow">How many times...</font>

486
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,410
<font color="yellow">would we get a chance to model, wearing suits that I made myself?</font>

487
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,480
<font color="yellow">- Let's do our best. - Sam Do's right.</font>

488
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,010
<font color="yellow">It's a once-in-a-lifetime event.</font>

489
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,780
<font color="yellow">Let's make this a lasting memory, Ddong Jin.</font>

490
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,810
<font color="yellow">I will. Just don't call me that.</font>

491
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,650
<font color="yellow">- Okay, Ddong Jin. - I feel great.</font>

492
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,080
<font color="yellow">It's my day.</font>

493
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,450
<font color="yellow">Seeing you like this...</font>

494
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,780
<font color="yellow">made me realise that you look great in suits.</font>

495
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,380
<font color="yellow">You're right. We should make him model our suits.</font>

496
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,280
<font color="yellow">If it's for Wolgyesu, I'll model for free.</font>

497
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,380
<font color="yellow">Sam Do, make me a suit, and I'll model forever.</font>

498
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,850
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't need you.</font>

499
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,280
<font color="yellow">Get ready, everyone.</font>

500
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,210
<font color="yellow">- It's time. - This is it.</font>

501
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,710
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, Ma'am.</font>

502
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,350
<font color="yellow">I said I don't want any dates. I just want to dance.</font>

503
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,250
<font color="yellow">No one wants to date you.</font>

504
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,150
<font color="yellow">Can you get off the stage? You're getting in everyone's way.</font>

505
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,410
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

506
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,710
<font color="yellow">You're taking up the whole stage.</font>

507
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,050
<font color="yellow">People are complaining that they can't dance.</font>

508
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,950
<font color="yellow">What's their problem?</font>

509
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,880
<font color="yellow">They can dance in their corner, and I can dance in mine.</font>

510
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,010
<font color="yellow">- Leave me alone. - I can't.</font>

511
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,110
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, let's go home.</font>

512
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,280
<font color="yellow">- Already? - What do you mean?</font>

513
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,110
<font color="yellow">You've been here for over an hour.</font>

514
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,650
<font color="yellow">Let's stay for just one more hour.</font>

515
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,880
<font color="yellow">It's Sam Do.</font>

516
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,350
<font color="yellow">What's he doing up there?</font>

517
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,250
<font color="yellow">He's doing all sorts of things now.</font>

518
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,050
<font color="yellow">Why has he changed so much?</font>

519
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,610
<font color="yellow">All that dancing helped me blow off some stress.</font>

520
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,880
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much about the baby.</font>

521
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,350
<font color="yellow">It's fine if Sam Do says it is.</font>

522
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,680
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid...</font>

523
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,010
<font color="yellow">he'll end up having a son with another woman.</font>

524
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,280
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

525
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,350
<font color="yellow">He would never do that.</font>

526
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,980
<font color="yellow">You never know.</font>

527
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,280
<font color="yellow">He says it's okay now,</font>

528
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,450
<font color="yellow">but he might change his mind when he gets older.</font>

529
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,150
<font color="yellow">You worry about things you shouldn't have to.</font>

530
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,980
<font color="yellow">I'd have no worry in the world if I had a husband like him.</font>

531
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,110
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

532
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,950
<font color="yellow">Leather Jacket might be good to date, but he's not for marriage.</font>

533
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,550
<font color="yellow">Try to make it work with Mr Park.</font>

534
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,180
<font color="yellow">Listen to me. I'm older, and I know better.</font>

535
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

536
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,950
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

537
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,810
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

538
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,610
<font color="yellow">We know them all.</font>

539
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,180
<font color="yellow">What's he doing there?</font>

540
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,410
<font color="yellow">Sir, can you stop the car?</font>

541
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,510
<font color="yellow">Today's the last day of the tailor competition.</font>

542
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,080
<font color="yellow">They held a fashion show.</font>

543
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,220
<font color="yellow">We should've gone there instead of the nightclub.</font>

544
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,110
<font color="yellow">I could've cheered for Jun.</font>

545
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,150
<font color="yellow">You're way too easy.</font>

546
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,220
<font color="yellow">After all the trouble he put you through,</font>

547
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,750
<font color="yellow">do you still want to support him?</font>

548
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,280
<font color="yellow">You're right, but...</font>

549
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,250
<font color="yellow">Let's play hard to get.</font>

550
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,510
<font color="yellow">Be confident, okay?</font>

551
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

552
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,450
<font color="yellow">He looks so different in a suit.</font>

553
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,110
<font color="yellow">Mr Park looks so ugly compared to my Jun.</font>

554
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,550
<font color="yellow">He really is...</font>

555
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,450
<font color="yellow">the best-looking man in Korea.</font>

556
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,250
<font color="yellow">So what if he is?</font>

557
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,480
<font color="yellow">He gives me such a hard time. What a waste of good looks.</font>

558
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,350
<font color="yellow">- Did you get off work together? - Yes.</font>

559
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

560
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,950
<font color="yellow">Why are you two so late?</font>

561
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,010
<font color="yellow">They did a fashion show after the competition,</font>

562
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,750
<font color="yellow">so we couldn't leave.</font>

563
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,810
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin looked so different. - What?</font>

564
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,880
<font color="yellow">Could you please bring me a glass of water?</font>

565
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

566
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,150
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

567
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,680
<font color="yellow">He looks much happier now. He smiles a lot, too.</font>

568
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,220
<font color="yellow">He even walked the runway as a model.</font>

569
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,310
<font color="yellow">- Who? Dong Jin? - Yes.</font>

570
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,480
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I find it very hard to believe.</font>

571
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,310
<font color="yellow">He's so square. What has gotten into him?</font>

572
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,350
<font color="yellow">I know, right? I wonder if he's already seeing someone.</font>

573
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,350
<font color="yellow">He looks so much happier compared to a few months ago.</font>

574
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,250
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

575
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,880
<font color="yellow">You have no taste.</font>

576
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,880
<font color="yellow">You look dashing.</font>

577
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,720
<font color="yellow">You look much more dashing than me.</font>

578
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,510
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

579
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,810
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, are you happy to be home after being away for so long?</font>

580
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,410
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm very happy.</font>

581
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,410
<font color="yellow">You haven't told Ms Choi that Mr Lee is coming home today, have you?</font>

582
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,680
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

583
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,480
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to believe her eyes.</font>

584
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,550
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's go in.</font>

585
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,910
<font color="yellow">We're home, Ms Choi!</font>

586
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,980
<font color="yellow">Welcome home. It must've been a long day for you guys.</font>

587
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,650
<font color="yellow">I'm back, Gok Ji.</font>

588
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,910
<font color="yellow">I'm here now.</font>

589
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,080
<font color="yellow">Who told you that you can come back here?</font>

590
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,850
<font color="yellow">You leave and come back as you wish.</font>

591
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,450
<font color="yellow">I hate you so much. Goodness.</font>

592
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,050
<font color="yellow">Then shall I leave again?</font>

593
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,550
<font color="yellow">Not a chance.</font>

594
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,980
<font color="yellow">I won't let you go anywhere. Never.</font>

595
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I worried you.</font>

596
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,780
<font color="yellow">I promise you that I'll never break your heart again.</font>

597
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,550
<font color="yellow">How can you just write a letter and leave like that?</font>

598
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,510
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried I've been?</font>

599
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,250
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

600
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,980
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

601
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
<font color="yellow">you don't look well.</font>

602
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,810
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

603
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,510
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

604
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,650
<font color="yellow">I missed you too much. That's probably why I don't look well.</font>

605
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,050
<font color="yellow">Goodness, don't be silly.</font>

606
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,650
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously. You're too much. You're such a handful.</font>

607
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to interrupt,</font>

608
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,550
<font color="yellow">but please save the lovers' spat for later.</font>

609
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,780
<font color="yellow">Go in and let us greet you properly.</font>

610
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,510
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Yes, please.</font>

611
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,810
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside. Come in.</font>

612
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,880
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy and grateful that you're back, Mr Lee.</font>

613
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,180
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who should thank you.</font>

614
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,350
<font color="yellow">You came back to the shop...</font>

615
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,720
<font color="yellow">and helped us win such a renowned award.</font>

616
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,110
<font color="yellow">I just did my job.</font>

617
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,810
<font color="yellow">Move over a little.</font>

618
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,380
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Come on.</font>

619
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,310
<font color="yellow">Please take my bow.</font>

620
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,510
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

621
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you bowing to my husband?</font>

622
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,950
<font color="yellow">What does it mean?</font>

623
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, nothing special.</font>

624
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,720
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to do it to show him my respect as a tenant.</font>

625
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,580
<font color="yellow">You want to be part of everything, don't you?</font>

626
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,850
<font color="yellow">Everyone, let's go. Dinner is ready.</font>

627
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,780
<font color="yellow">- All right. - Okay.</font>

628
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,750
<font color="yellow">That looks heavy. Give it to me.</font>

629
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,610
<font color="yellow">It's a late dinner.</font>

630
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,880
<font color="yellow">There aren't many dishes, but I hope you enjoy everything.</font>

631
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,080
<font color="yellow">Eat up, Honey.</font>

632
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,480
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's eat, everyone.</font>

633
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,280
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

634
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,980
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee. May I ask what your favourite song is?</font>

635
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,650
<font color="yellow">I'd like to welcome you and celebrate your safe return...</font>

636
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,280
<font color="yellow">by singing your favourite song for you.</font>

637
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,450
<font color="yellow">We're having dinner, so we should focus on eating.</font>

638
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,950
<font color="yellow">Just eat your food and go to your room.</font>

639
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,780
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

640
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,910
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, I'm here.</font>

641
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,680
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi? Oh, there you are.</font>

642
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,450
<font color="yellow">Why is that bloke here again?</font>

643
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,810
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you.</font>

644
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,780
<font color="yellow">Mr Park is dating Dong Sook.</font>

645
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,750
<font color="yellow">I invited him because I thought you should meet him.</font>

646
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,510
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Lee. My name is Park Dae Sub.</font>

647
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,250
<font color="yellow">Please take my bow.</font>

648
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,080
<font color="yellow">I'll join you if that's okay.</font>

649
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,450
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, please. - Hey. Ouch...</font>

650
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,780
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

651
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,220
<font color="yellow">I even like the way you bow.</font>

652
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,750
<font color="yellow">Why is he acting all friendly as if he has met Mr Lee before?</font>

653
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,850
<font color="yellow">Don't you think he's too much?</font>

654
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,610
<font color="yellow">He's going way overboard.</font>

655
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,350
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, can you bring a bowl of rice and soup for Mr Park?</font>

656
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,680
<font color="yellow">Sure, that's no problem.</font>

657
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, do you need something?</font>

658
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,410
<font color="yellow">No. The rice is in here, right?</font>

659
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,050
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's okay.</font>

660
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,750
<font color="yellow">I can do this much.</font>

661
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,980
<font color="yellow">You two look like a newly-wed couple.</font>

662
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,850
<font color="yellow">- That's nonsense. - What are you talking about?</font>

663
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,910
<font color="yellow">Why do you guys look so serious?</font>

664
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,480
<font color="yellow">I was just kidding. I don't know why you're taking it so seriously.</font>

665
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that wasn't even funny. Why did you come here?</font>

666
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,550
<font color="yellow">I can't swallow my food there because of someone I can't stand.</font>

667
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,110
<font color="yellow">It looks heavy. Give it to me. I'll carry it for you.</font>

668
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,610
<font color="yellow">What was that about? Is something really going on between them?</font>

669
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,450
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

670
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,480
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook is home.</font>

671
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,510
<font color="yellow">- Mr Lee. - My gosh!</font>

672
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,250
<font color="yellow">Dad! When did you come back?</font>

673
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,510
<font color="yellow">I've been so worried about you.</font>

674
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,080
<font color="yellow">I called you and sent you so many texts, but you never got back to me.</font>

675
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,410
<font color="yellow">I'm back safe and sound, so all is good now, right?</font>

676
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,710
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm so glad that you're back.</font>

677
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,350
<font color="yellow">- Thanks so much for coming back. - I'm glad, too.</font>

678
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,980
<font color="yellow">We would've rushed home if we had known that you're back.</font>

679
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,010
<font color="yellow">Thank you for making such a big decision.</font>

680
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,350
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to have Sam Do back at the shop.</font>

681
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,410
<font color="yellow">I called the fried chicken place, and they said you weren't there.</font>

682
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,050
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

683
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,550
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

684
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously. This woman...</font>

685
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,750
<font color="yellow">Mr Park. What brings you here by the way?</font>

686
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,850
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

687
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,310
<font color="yellow">How can I do nothing when my future father-in-law is back?</font>

688
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,280
<font color="yellow">I had to come meet him, of course.</font>

689
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,580
<font color="yellow">Father-in-law?</font>

690
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,950
<font color="yellow">How can you make such a rash remark?</font>

691
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,980
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

692
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,150
<font color="yellow">I like that he's so straightforward.</font>

693
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, boy.</font>

694
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,010
<font color="yellow">What is that in your hand?</font>

695
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,910
<font color="yellow">I went shopping with Dong Sook.</font>

696
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,450
<font color="yellow">I got this 300-dollar dress for myself.</font>

697
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,510
<font color="yellow">I also bought this 100-dollar scarf for myself.</font>

698
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,950
<font color="yellow">And I got this 2,000-dollar designer purse, too.</font>

699
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,210
<font color="yellow">2,000 dollars? Are you out of your mind?</font>

700
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,310
<font color="yellow">You always do whatever you want.</font>

701
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,410
<font color="yellow">I've decided to do whatever I want from now on like you.</font>

702
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,110
<font color="yellow">You're honestly being so ridiculous.</font>

703
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,750
<font color="yellow">I guess you're doing this because I booked vasectomy secretly.</font>

704
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,680
<font color="yellow">You can't do this, though.</font>

705
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,250
<font color="yellow">Let's sit down and talk since the topic has come up already.</font>

706
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,180
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you. Get lost.</font>

707
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,080
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

708
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,280
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to say it again?</font>

709
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,150
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

710
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,780
<font color="yellow">- Mr Park. - Yes.</font>

711
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,550
<font color="yellow">I'll say this again.</font>

712
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,910
<font color="yellow">Please don't visit my place without my permission.</font>

713
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,910
<font color="yellow">As you know, my future mother-in-law invited me today.</font>

714
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,680
<font color="yellow">It's not like we're married.</font>

715
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,850
<font color="yellow">It's uncomfortable to hear you call my parents your in-laws.</font>

716
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,310
<font color="yellow">Marriage? We'll soon get married anyway.</font>

717
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,880
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

718
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,750
<font color="yellow">When did I ever say I wanted a proposal from you?</font>

719
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,380
<font color="yellow">"Proposal"?</font>

720
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,080
<font color="yellow">Were you expecting that from me?</font>

721
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,050
<font color="yellow">What's with women and their obsession with proposals?</font>

722
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,750
<font color="yellow">- That's not what I meant. - I understand.</font>

723
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,010
<font color="yellow">Just give me some time.</font>

724
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,750
<font color="yellow">I'll put a lot of money into it and surprise you.</font>

725
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,780
<font color="yellow">You just wait. Got it?</font>

726
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,650
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Mum. - Hello.</font>

727
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,510
<font color="yellow">You're coming home late.</font>

728
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,850
<font color="yellow">- I work night shifts. - I see.</font>

729
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,410
<font color="yellow">Let's see here. You've been working hard.</font>

730
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,650
<font color="yellow">How about I give you some allowance?</font>

731
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,510
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. I'll pass.</font>

732
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,710
<font color="yellow">In this case, you just say thank you and accept the money.</font>

733
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,610
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

734
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,310
<font color="yellow">Hands.</font>

735
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,950
<font color="yellow">Hold out your hands.</font>

736
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,280
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

737
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,280
<font color="yellow">On top of that, here's one more.</font>

738
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,980
<font color="yellow">You thought I was done, right?</font>

739
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,180
<font color="yellow">There's another one.</font>

740
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,210
<font color="yellow">Let's make it 30 dollars.</font>

741
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,810
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Sure.</font>

742
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,550
<font color="yellow">Buy yourself something nice.</font>

743
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,680
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

744
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,810
<font color="yellow">Now that I took out my wallet, I'll give you some allowance, too.</font>

745
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,910
<font color="yellow">I'm good.</font>

746
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,080
<font color="yellow">It's fine. This is nothing. Here you go.</font>

747
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,350
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

748
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,650
<font color="yellow">- Is it too much? - Yes.</font>

749
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,850
<font color="yellow">It's way too much.</font>

750
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,450
<font color="yellow">I can't accept this kind of money without having a heart attack.</font>

751
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,650
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

752
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,280
<font color="yellow">She's even thrifty.</font>

753
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,380
<font color="yellow">I like that.</font>

754
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,650
<font color="yellow">She's quite the opposite to how she looks.</font>

755
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,310
<font color="yellow">She has every right to be my wife...</font>

756
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,450
<font color="yellow">You scared me!</font>

757
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,610
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - 50 dollars? Is that it?</font>

758
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,750
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you own buildings? You're lying, aren't you?</font>

759
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,080
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

760
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,780
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much wastepaper you need to recycle for 50 dollars?</font>

761
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,180
<font color="yellow">There's a reason why you're still living on rent at that age.</font>

762
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:01,110
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to live on rent? Are you trying to start a fight?</font>

763
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,380
<font color="yellow">Here we go again.</font>

764
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,450
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. Hit me.</font>

765
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,380
<font color="yellow">This should make some pocket change. Go on. Hit me.</font>

766
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,680
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - You're pathetic.</font>

767
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,210
<font color="yellow">Hitting other people takes money, too.</font>

768
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,410
<font color="yellow">People who live on rent like you...</font>

769
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,280
<font color="yellow">can't afford to go around punching other people. Got it?</font>

770
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,710
<font color="yellow">Why you little...</font>

771
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,910
<font color="yellow">I won't forget this.</font>

772
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,080
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee and Ms Choi, I'll be going now.</font>

773
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,310
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a ride.</font>

774
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,480
<font color="yellow">We're going the same direction. Tae Yang said he'd walk me home.</font>

775
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,480
<font color="yellow">All right, then. Have a safe trip.</font>

776
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,580
<font color="yellow">- Are you done now? - Yes.</font>

777
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,980
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, then. - Okay.</font>

778
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,250
<font color="yellow">Where's Yun Shil?</font>

779
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,410
<font color="yellow">- She just left. - Why did she go so early?</font>

780
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,750
<font color="yellow">I packed all the side dishes and bulgogi for her to take home.</font>

781
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,380
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

782
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,880
<font color="yellow">- I'll deliver them to her. - You will?</font>

783
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,650
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

784
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:28,850
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

785
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,580
<font color="yellow">I'll have to quit my job.</font>

786
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,750
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something happen?</font>

787
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,380
<font color="yellow">Mr Min found out...</font>

788
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,710
<font color="yellow">about me and Ji Yun.</font>

789
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,910
<font color="yellow">But all you wanted to do was...</font>

790
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,710
<font color="yellow">prove your worth regardless of your relationship with her.</font>

791
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,180
<font color="yellow">Don't rush into any decisions.</font>

792
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,310
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

793
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,880
<font color="yellow">I thought I got the job because I was worth it.</font>

794
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,550
<font color="yellow">But Mr Min knew of our relationship in the first place and hired me.</font>

795
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,910
<font color="yellow">- What? - I think he wanted to play with us.</font>

796
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,050
<font color="yellow">He enjoyed watching our reaction...</font>

797
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,710
<font color="yellow">as he planned everything behind our backs.</font>

798
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,750
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

799
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,250
<font color="yellow">I should have known.</font>

800
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,680
<font color="yellow">I should have known he's a wicked man...</font>

801
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,280
<font color="yellow">when he switched our suits.</font>

802
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,210
<font color="yellow">I know I'm desperate,</font>

803
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,050
<font color="yellow">but I can't continue working there knowing his intentions.</font>

804
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,010
<font color="yellow">Does Ji Yun know about this?</font>

805
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,080
<font color="yellow">I heard this from her.</font>

806
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,610
<font color="yellow">She's still not going to break up with him?</font>

807
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,510
<font color="yellow">She said she was grateful...</font>

808
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,950
<font color="yellow">for him not leaving her despite knowing everything.</font>

809
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,080
<font color="yellow">She's not in her right mind, either.</font>

810
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,350
<font color="yellow">I noticed that she's changed a lot when I saw her earlier today.</font>

811
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,410
<font color="yellow">I'm having a hard time trying to understand everything.</font>

812
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,010
<font color="yellow">I'm confused.</font>

813
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,210
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

814
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:22,850
<font color="yellow">It's me, Dong Jin.</font>

815
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,480
<font color="yellow">My mum asked me dearly...</font>

816
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,980
<font color="yellow">to deliver you this food.</font>

817
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,250
<font color="yellow">Open up.</font>

818
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:36,910
<font color="yellow">Is she sleeping already?</font>

819
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,150
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

820
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,180
<font color="yellow">Hello? Open up, already.</font>

821
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,610
<font color="yellow">It's me, Dong Jin.</font>

822
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,550
<font color="yellow">Isn't she too old to go to bed this early?</font>

823
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,350
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

824
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,380
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

825
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:07,910
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams.</font>

826
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,780
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here? - Oh, gosh.</font>

827
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

828
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,450
<font color="yellow">Oh, I...</font>

829
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,310
<font color="yellow">My mum got me to send you these.</font>

830
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,350
<font color="yellow">She packed some food for you.</font>

831
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,810
<font color="yellow">Well, I didn't want to come.</font>

832
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,280
<font color="yellow">I'm really tired.</font>

833
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,510
<font color="yellow">I asked her if I could give you this tomorrow,</font>

834
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,480
<font color="yellow">but she kept insisting that I give you this today.</font>

835
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,010
<font color="yellow">You know how stubborn she can get.</font>

836
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,850
<font color="yellow">Right. Good work today.</font>

837
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,980
<font color="yellow">- Let's go out drinking some time. - Sure, Dong Jin.</font>

838
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,110
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow, Yun Shil.</font>

839
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,210
<font color="yellow">I almost took the food with me.</font>

840
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,210
<font color="yellow">I forget things these days.</font>

841
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,050
<font color="yellow">I'll really go now.</font>

842
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,110
<font color="yellow">Don't be wandering around so late.</font>

843
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,150
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

844
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,110
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. It's nothing.</font>

845
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,110
<font color="yellow">I'll go now.</font>

846
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,010
<font color="yellow">What's going on with him?</font>

847
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:36,680
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee's been acting strange today.</font>

848
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,110
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

849
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,980
<font color="yellow">he has a crush on you.</font>

850
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,010
<font color="yellow">Who does?</font>

851
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,780
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, of course.</font>

852
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,750
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

853
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,950
<font color="yellow">Why would he have a crush on someone like me?</font>

854
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,950
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

855
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,510
<font color="yellow">I think I'm right about this.</font>

856
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,750
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

857
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,610
<font color="yellow">I'm certain.</font>

858
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,150
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin has a crush on you.</font>

859
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,810
<font color="yellow">Ms Min?</font>

860
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,350
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

861
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,450
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for you.</font>

862
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,010
<font color="yellow">Why would you wait for me?</font>

863
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,110
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

864
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,310
<font color="yellow">- I marked you. - What?</font>

865
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:43,710
<font color="yellow">I marked you as mine.</font>

866
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,080
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Yang is mine now.</font>

867
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,110
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to let anyone else take you away from me.</font>

868
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,410
<font color="yellow">Ms Min.</font>

869
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so unreasonable?</font>

870
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,280
<font color="yellow">Are you mocking me?</font>

871
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,380
<font color="yellow">Why are you so twisted?</font>

872
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,250
<font color="yellow">I'm not mocking you.</font>

873
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,110
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you that I love you.</font>

874
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,010
<font color="yellow">I already told you.</font>

875
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,180
<font color="yellow">I don't feel the same way about you.</font>

876
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,810
<font color="yellow">But if you keep doing this,</font>

877
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,180
<font color="yellow">it makes me think that you're mocking me.</font>

878
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,380
<font color="yellow">I've never loved anyone like this...</font>

879
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,480
<font color="yellow">in my life.</font>

880
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,950
<font color="yellow">I fell for you when I first laid my eyes on you.</font>

881
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,910
<font color="yellow">I constantly thought about you and missed you.</font>

882
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,080
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you think I'm shallow and have no self-esteem.</font>

883
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,710
<font color="yellow">When you love someone with all of your heart,</font>

884
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,310
<font color="yellow">things like self-esteem don't matter.</font>

885
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,410
<font color="yellow">- Ms Min. - My name is Hyo Won.</font>

886
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,250
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

887
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,810
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, I get that...</font>

888
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,350
<font color="yellow">you're the purest person I've ever met.</font>

889
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,980
<font color="yellow">But that's about it. I don't have any more feelings.</font>

890
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,910
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

891
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,150
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm really not your type.</font>

892
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,110
<font color="yellow">I get it. I'm not some stalker.</font>

893
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,010
<font color="yellow">I won't continue to do this if you say so.</font>

894
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about everything.</font>

895
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:29,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

896
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,680
<font color="yellow">You should be.</font>

897
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,850
<font color="yellow">You should be sorry, Tae Yang.</font>

898
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,450
<font color="yellow">Do you know why?</font>

899
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:43,510
<font color="yellow">From now on, no other woman will ever love you the way I loved you.</font>

900
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going.</font>

901
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,050
<font color="yellow">I'll get you a cab.</font>

902
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,050
<font color="yellow">Stop being kind to me.</font>

903
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,610
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing this,</font>

904
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,980
<font color="yellow">I might not be able to forget you.</font>

905
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:15,810
<font color="yellow">I'll go now.</font>

906
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:53,110
<font color="yellow">You're going to quit working at the tailor shop?</font>

907
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,610
<font color="yellow">Now that there's Dong Jin...</font>

908
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:59,580
<font color="yellow">and Sam Do, it's about time I step down.</font>

909
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:03,510
<font color="yellow">Are you sure we can leave the tailor shop up to those kids?</font>

910
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,280
<font color="yellow">Fresh eggs belong in a new basket.</font>

911
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,850
<font color="yellow">They'll figure it out on their own.</font>

912
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,480
<font color="yellow">But you spent your whole life doing needlework.</font>

913
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,180
<font color="yellow">What are you intending to do all day without suits?</font>

914
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,380
