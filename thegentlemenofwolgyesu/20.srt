110
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,109
<font color="yellow">Is all this for me?</font>

111
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,369
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what you like, so I ordered one of each.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me. Eat all you want.</font>

128
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,639
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

129
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,299
<font color="yellow">Because I want to look at you.</font>

130
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,699

140
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,669

141
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,739
<font color="yellow">- I'll eat the rest at my desk. - Don't be so picky.</font>

142

<font color="yellow">- I asked him to join me. - Why not the others, then?</font>

156
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,669
<font color="yellow">- What if people gossip? - Stop it.</font>

157
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,269
<font color="yellow">Don't make a fuss out of nothing.</font>

158
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:53,799
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

159
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,239
<font color="yellow">I will tell you again, just to make it clear.</font>

160
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,839
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won isn't the average employee, so treat her properly.</font>

161
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,339
<font color="yellow">Don't cause a scandal...</font>

162
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,139
<font color="yellow">that will make her and our family look bad.</font>

163
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,199
<font color="yellow">You'll be the death of me.</font>

164
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,939
<font color="yellow">- Get off, Mum. - What floor is this?</font>

165
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,639
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see your brother.</font>

166
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,869
<font color="yellow">Just get off.</font>

167
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,999
<font color="yellow">- Remember what I said. - He doesn't have to.</font>

168
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:23,639
<font color="yellow">- Forget about it, Tae Yang. - Hey.</font>

169
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,639
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

170
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,039
<font color="yellow">This is so confusing.</font>

171
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,569
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

172
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,869
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

173
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,399
<font color="yellow">You drive me up the wall.</font>

174
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,339
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Tae Yang saw it all.</font>

175
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,969
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything wrong, did I?</font>

176
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,799
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

177
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,199
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

178
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:51,799
<font color="yellow">I caught her alone with a male employee...</font>

179
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,539
<font color="yellow">and gave him a warning, and that set her off.</font>

180
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,269
<font color="yellow">Who? Kang Tae Yang?</font>

181
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,369
<font color="yellow">Yes. I sensed something fishy, so I told him to back off,</font>

182
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,399
<font color="yellow">and she's complaining that I embarrassed her.</font>

183
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,899
<font color="yellow">- You're so crass and rude! - What?</font>

184
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,099
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

185
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,299
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won's immature and all that,</font>

186
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,439
<font color="yellow">but she'd never fall for someone like him.</font>

187
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,039
<font color="yellow">- She has standards. - What's wrong with him?</font>

188
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,639
<font color="yellow">He has nothing to his name.</font>

189
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,669
<font color="yellow">His dad died when he was young, and his mum's a farmer.</font>

190
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:21,869
<font color="yellow">He has nowhere to stay, so he lives in a gosiwon.</font>

191
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,739
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

192
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,469
<font color="yellow">I happened to overhear some staff talk about him.</font>

193
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:30,939
<font color="yellow">My goodness. He looked rich, so I had my hopes up,</font>

194
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,839
<font color="yellow">but he's just useless.</font>

195
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,099
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

196
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,339
<font color="yellow">stay out of my business.</font>

197
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:39,039
<font color="yellow">How dare you.</font>

198
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,939
<font color="yellow">Something's going on.</font>

199
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:49,739
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

200
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,769
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won's naive and silly and all that,</font>

201
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,099
<font color="yellow">but she wouldn't fall for Tae Yang.</font>

202
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,699
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

203
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,169
<font color="yellow">Don't forget you have a blind date today.</font>

204
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,439
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

205
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,969
<font color="yellow">Is it because of that announcer?</font>

206
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,099
<font color="yellow">It's because of my pride.</font>

207
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,299
<font color="yellow">I don't want to meet a woman whose mum looks down on us.</font>

210
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,969

211
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,839
<font color="yellow">The whole world mocked and ridiculed me,</font>

212
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,339
<font color="yellow">but you were my only hope and strength.</font>

213
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,599

<font color="yellow">Nothing. What should I do first?</font>

259
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:54,499
<font color="yellow">When Dong Sook was young, people wanted her to enter pageants.</font>

00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:57,969
<font color="yellow">At least five beauty parlour owners came to ask for my permission.</font>

00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,169
<font color="yellow">It wasn't just her looks.</font>

267
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:17,309
<font color="yellow">Apparently, she ate like a starved woman the whole evening.</font>

<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

273
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,899

274
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:36,099
<font color="yellow">Mr Park spent over 300 dollars on food alone.</font>

275

00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:19,469
<font color="yellow">I'm coming down with a cold. I just need to take some medicine.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

285
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:22,269
<font color="yellow">I'll get you something.</font>

286
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,839
<font color="yellow">I'll go myself once I finish this.</font>

287
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,569
<font color="yellow">Seeing Gi Pyo must've stressed you out.</font>

288
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,199
<font color="yellow">What did he say to you this time?</font>

289
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,809
<font color="yellow">He didn't say anything.</font>

290
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,739
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he did. I know what he's like.</font>

291

00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,069

<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

295
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:56,599
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

296
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,599
<font color="yellow">Something for indigestion and headaches, too.</font>

303
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,439
<font color="yellow">You're buying all sorts of things.</font>

304
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:20,039
<font color="yellow">I'm just replenishing my medicine cabinet.</font>

305
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,439

306
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,499
<font color="yellow">It looks like you have a cold.</font>

307
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,139
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - You should...</font>

<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

463
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:57,769
<font color="yellow">I think she's cheating on me.</font>

464
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,399
<font color="yellow">Hello and welcome.</font>

465
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:11,039
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - I don't feel like singing.</font>

466
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,199
<font color="yellow">It's your first day at work. Let's celebrate.</font>

467
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,469
<font color="yellow">We haven't done this in a few months.</font>

468
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,639
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like it.</font>

469
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:21,799
<font color="yellow">- Is there a room? - Of course.</font>

470
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:24,269
<font color="yellow">Go into room four. How long will you stay?</font>

471
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,199
<font color="yellow">- One hour for starters. - Okay.</font>

472
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,799
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 20 more minutes for free.</font>

473
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:30,339
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Okay.</font>

474
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,499
<font color="yellow">How embarrassing.</font>

475
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,369
<font color="yellow">I wonder if she'll like this.</font>

476
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,139
<font color="yellow">I should give her extra.</font>

477
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,999
<font color="yellow">Enjoy yourselves.</font>

478
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:08,499
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

479
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:11,399
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Aren't you a singer?</font>

480
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:14,299
<font color="yellow">I'm not. You're mistaken.</font>

481
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:16,769
<font color="yellow">I'm not mistaken.</font>

482
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,169
<font color="yellow">He looks like the singer...</font>

483
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,039
<font color="yellow">- you used to like in high school. - No.</font>

484
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,639
<font color="yellow">That was someone else.</font>

485
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,669
<font color="yellow">I remember him, though.</font>

486
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,769
<font color="yellow">What was that song he sang? It was about a handkerchief.</font>

487
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,739
<font color="yellow">Why would a singer be working here?</font>

488
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:35,569
<font color="yellow">- You should get back to work. - I should.</font>

489
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:36,769
<font color="yellow">Enjoy yourselves.</font>

490
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:37,899
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

491
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,199
<font color="yellow">Sung Jun's "Susanna's Handkerchief".</font>

492
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,639
<font color="yellow">"Susanna's Handkerchief"? I never heard of that song before.</font>

493
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,439
<font color="yellow">That's because you're young.</font>

494
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:46,639
<font color="yellow">He was famous back in my day.</font>

495
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,539
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you on TV at all.</font>

496
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:51,299
<font color="yellow">- Do you own a karaoke bar? - Yes, well...</font>

497
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,669
<font color="yellow">Seeing that we met,</font>

498
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,839
<font color="yellow">could you please sing...</font>

499
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:59,239
<font color="yellow">- "Susanna's Handkerchief"? - What?</font>

500
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:01,799
<font color="yellow">How could you ask him such a thing?</font>

501
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,239
<font color="yellow">It's good to see someone from our era.</font>

502
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,099
<font color="yellow">Sing it for us.</font>

503
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,539
<font color="yellow">I found the song.</font>

504
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:10,399
<font color="yellow">Sing for us. Sing for us.</font>

505
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:12,099
<font color="yellow">Sing for us.</font>

506
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,169
<font color="yellow">I'll willingly sing for my fans.</font>

507
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:16,569
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

508
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:24,869
<font color="yellow">When I looked at your beautiful face.</font>

509
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:31,839
<font color="yellow">It brought tears to my eyes.</font>

510
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,539
<font color="yellow">That's when you would silently.</font>

511
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:46,439
<font color="yellow">Hand me your handkerchief.</font>

512
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,569
<font color="yellow">- You used to always tell me - Mister.</font>

513
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,099
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Why are you here? We're busy.</font>

514
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,699
<font color="yellow">They asked me to sing a song.</font>

515
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,139
<font color="yellow">You can't leave the counter unattended.</font>

516
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,639
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

517
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,939
<font color="yellow">I'll sing for you some other time.</font>

518
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,199
<font color="yellow">Have a good time.</font>

519
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,069
<font color="yellow">Why did you give them so much popcorn?</font>

520
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:08,939
<font color="yellow">They're regulars, okay?</font>

521
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:11,339
<font color="yellow">It's my business, not yours.</font>

522
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:27,069
<font color="yellow">What should I do with him?</font>

523
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:37,569
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Come home right now.</font>

524
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:38,599
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

525
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:43,539
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mum.</font>

526
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:45,399
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - Sit down.</font>

527
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:51,569
<font color="yellow">- About Mr Park. - Who's that?</font>

528
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,669
<font color="yellow">Your blind date.</font>

529
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:59,039
<font color="yellow">Oh, the Mr Park I went on a date with?</font>

530
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,439
<font color="yellow">- What about him? - The matchmaker said...</font>

531
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:04,569
<font color="yellow">on the day you two met,</font>

532
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,969
<font color="yellow">you ate three portions of meat, a bowl of naengmyeon,</font>

533
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:09,299
<font color="yellow">cake and coffee.</font>

534
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:12,039
<font color="yellow">He spent over 300 dollars just on food.</font>

535
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,369
<font color="yellow">- Is that true? - What?</font>

536
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,709
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. It's all true.</font>

537
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,039
<font color="yellow">You're a picky eater with almost no appetite.</font>

538
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,569
<font color="yellow">How can you eat over 300 dollars' worth of food?</font>

539
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,599
<font color="yellow">You know that...</font>

540
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:30,069
<font color="yellow">I haven't been eating well because I was stressed.</font>

541
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:32,299
<font color="yellow">Mr Park took me to a barbecue place,</font>

542
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,369
<font color="yellow">and the food there was so delicious.</font>

543
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,299
<font color="yellow">Still, it's very unlike you.</font>

544
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,969
<font color="yellow">Aren't 3 servings too much food for 1 person?</font>

545
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:42,839
<font color="yellow">You know how those high-end restaurants are.</font>

546
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,969
<font color="yellow">One serving was less than a handful of food.</font>

547
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:50,369
<font color="yellow">Wait a second. Didn't he complain about my looks the other day?</font>

548
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,269
<font color="yellow">Is he now saying that I eat like a glutton?</font>

549
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:55,769
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you're such a fool.</font>

550
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,139
<font color="yellow">If you were hungry, you should've just waited until you got home.</font>

551
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,599
<font color="yellow">You met him for the first time that day.</font>

552
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:03,969
<font color="yellow">How can you eat three servings of meat in front of him?</font>

553
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,369
<font color="yellow">That was a blind date, not a barbecue feast!</font>

554
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,669
<font color="yellow">I didn't expect this outcome.</font>

555
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,269
<font color="yellow">I'm home, Honey.</font>

556
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,299
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting home just now?</font>

557
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:28,239
<font color="yellow">How can a housewife neglect housework...</font>

558
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:30,539
<font color="yellow">and stay out until this late hour?</font>

559
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,069
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

560
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,209
<font color="yellow">I had a busy day due to my business.</font>

561
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,339
<font color="yellow">Business? What business?</font>

562
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:39,669
<font color="yellow">What kind of business is keeping you busy? Are you cheating on me?</font>

563
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,169
<font color="yellow">Cheating? What are you talking about?</font>

564
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:44,299
<font color="yellow">Why would you be out until this late if you're not cheating on me?</font>

565
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,069
<font color="yellow">Give me his number.</font>

566
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:50,439
<font color="yellow">- Who? - Who do you think?</font>

567
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,369
<font color="yellow">That weasel who gave you a ride the other day.</font>

568
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:56,399
<font color="yellow">I see. Mr Park? Why do you want his number?</font>

569
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:59,939
<font color="yellow">I need to see what kind of weasel is shaking its tail...</font>

570
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:01,939
<font color="yellow">to seduce my wife with my own two eyes.</font>

571
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,569
<font color="yellow">This is a serious case of delusional jealousy.</font>

572
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,339
<font color="yellow">This is why marrying someone in your league is important.</font>

573
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,739
<font color="yellow">You were too greedy for your own good...</font>

574
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,799
<font color="yellow">Because you married someone like me.</font>

575
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,469
<font color="yellow">Because you married someone like me.</font>

576
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,209
<font color="yellow">That's why you're always anxious and nervous.</font>

577
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,139
<font color="yellow">That's why you're always anxious and nervous.</font>

578
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,539
<font color="yellow">In short, you're living in chronic, habitual paranoia.</font>

579
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,469
<font color="yellow">You're living in chronic, habitual paranoia.</font>

580
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:32,039
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so tired.</font>

581
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,169
<font color="yellow">I need to get some rest.</font>

582
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,869
<font color="yellow">Honey, wait. I'm not done yet.</font>

583
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,869
<font color="yellow">Who were you with? What did you do? Answer me!</font>

584
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:42,299
<font color="yellow">Don't be so lame and clingy. Let go!</font>

585
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:53,099
<font color="yellow">Is she traumatised from the false pregnancy?</font>

586
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:56,099
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

587
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,669
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what am I supposed to do?</font>

588
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:15,739
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, I shouldn't have talked about your ex-girlfriend.</font>

589
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,769
<font color="yellow">Forgive me.</font>

590
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:22,439
<font color="yellow">You look the most handsome when you smile, so don't be angry.</font>

591
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:24,939
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

592
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,099
<font color="yellow">Why is she being like this to me?</font>

593
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,599
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Hey.</font>

594
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,069
<font color="yellow">How are your eyes?</font>

595
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:47,709
<font color="yellow">I feel less burdened because I was able to accomplish what I had to do.</font>

596
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,999
<font color="yellow">I feel like I can see better now because of it.</font>

597
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,339
<font color="yellow">The weather has gotten quite chilly,</font>

598
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:55,439
<font color="yellow">so I bought a sweater for you. I hope you like it.</font>

599
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:57,839
<font color="yellow">It feels very nice.</font>

600
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,469
<font color="yellow">The size is also perfect for me.</font>

601
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:02,669
<font color="yellow">I see that you've adapted yourself to the tailoring business now.</font>

602
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:09,639
<font color="yellow">Oh, we decided to participate in the Bespoke Suit Tailoring Competition.</font>

603
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:12,239
<font color="yellow">I see. I'm glad to hear that.</font>

604
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:16,339
<font color="yellow">Sam Do hesitated because he didn't want to disgrace your reputation,</font>

605
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,799
<font color="yellow">but the other employees and I persuaded him.</font>

606
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,499
<font color="yellow">I trust that Sam Do can do it.</font>

607
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,339
<font color="yellow">Yes. We're currently working on the suit for the preliminaries.</font>

608
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,069
<font color="yellow">Sam Do is in charge of the design and tailoring...</font>

609
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,369
<font color="yellow">while Yun Shil is taking care of the actual sewing.</font>

610
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:33,939
<font color="yellow">I know how meticulous Yun Shil is when she sews.</font>

611
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,299
<font color="yellow">You'll certainly pass the preliminary round.</font>

612
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:40,669
<font color="yellow">I wish you could come to the finals and cheer for us.</font>

613
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,639
<font color="yellow">By the way, how is your friend doing?</font>

614
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,069
<font color="yellow">Doctors say that she can pass away any day now.</font>

615
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:50,839
<font color="yellow">But since she has many regrets,</font>

616
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,669
<font color="yellow">it's hard for her to let go of her life.</font>

617
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,139
<font color="yellow">I told her to stop tormenting herself and to just let it go.</font>

618
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:01,239
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

619
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,439
<font color="yellow">What did you love about her?</font>

620
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,899
<font color="yellow">I loved her bright smile.</font>

621
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:11,599
<font color="yellow">Her smile used to brighten up the entire world around her.</font>

622
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:14,239
<font color="yellow">Your mum is prettier than her,</font>

623
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:18,469
<font color="yellow">but she had the most beautiful smile I've ever seen.</font>

624
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:35,769
<font color="yellow">Do you regret parting ways with her?</font>

625
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:39,439
<font color="yellow">I don't regret it because I met your mum,</font>

626
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:44,939
<font color="yellow">but I ran away like a coward instead of making a decision.</font>

627
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,709
<font color="yellow">I can't stop beating myself up for that.</font>

628
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,839
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, a man must not...</font>

629
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:54,599
<font color="yellow">take a step back when he has to muster up his courage.</font>

630
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,099
<font color="yellow">Nothing in life comes for free.</font>

631
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,139
<font color="yellow">When you truly want something,</font>

632
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:02,469
<font color="yellow">you must be willing to overcome obstacles to make it yours.</font>

633
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:27,339
<font color="yellow">This looks great here.</font>

634
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,299
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so chilly now.</font>

635
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:31,369
<font color="yellow">- Good morning, Ms Geum. - Where is Yun Shil?</font>

636
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:35,209
<font color="yellow">She caught a bad cold, so I don't think she can work today.</font>

637
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,939
<font color="yellow">I went upstairs to check on her, and she has a high fever.</font>

638
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,069
<font color="yellow">- Shouldn't she go see a doctor? - I told her that I'd take her,</font>

639
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:43,069
<font color="yellow">but she kept saying she's fine because she took medicine.</font>

640
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,339
<font color="yellow">I heard that the cold that's going around now is a really bad one.</font>

641
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:48,669
<font color="yellow">I guess she was stressed out about visiting Gi Pyo yesterday.</font>

642
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,839
<font color="yellow">She's become so sick all of a sudden.</font>

643
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,669
<font color="yellow">I can't just leave her like that. I'll take her to a doctor.</font>

644
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,469
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll take her.</font>

645
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:57,469
<font color="yellow">- You will? - Really?</font>

646
00:40:57,469 --> 00:41:00,369
<font color="yellow">We're backed up on orders, so you two should work. I'll be back soon.</font>

647
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:04,709
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil. It's me, Dong Jin. Let me in.</font>

648
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,599
<font color="yellow">Are you there? Please open the door.</font>

649
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:12,769
<font color="yellow">Is she not home?</font>

650
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:22,839
<font color="yellow">It's open.</font>

651
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:32,339
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

652
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:36,269
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

653
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:42,569
<font color="yellow">Is she unconscious?</font>

654
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:51,269
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, wake up.</font>

655
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:54,939
<font color="yellow">It looks like she's unconscious.</font>

656
00:41:56,899 --> 00:41:57,939
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

657
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,499
<font color="yellow">Is she asleep?</font>

658
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,299
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my goodness! - Gosh, you startled me.</font>

659
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,709
<font color="yellow">Ouch, my head! What are you doing here?</font>

660
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,639
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Is your head okay?</font>

661
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,969
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm fine.</font>

662
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,569
<font color="yellow">What brings you here by the way?</font>

663
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:21,869
<font color="yellow">Master Bae sent me here to take you to a doctor.</font>

664
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,339
<font color="yellow">Let me take you to a hospital.</font>

665
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,969
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

666
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:27,439
<font color="yellow">You don't look fine. You're coughing.</font>

667
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:29,869
<font color="yellow">I felt really sick until this morning,</font>

668
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:33,369
<font color="yellow">but I feel much better now because I had a good sleep.</font>

669
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,569
<font color="yellow">I still think you should go see a doctor.</font>

670
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:39,069
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay. I feel totally fine now.</font>

671
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:43,209
<font color="yellow">That cold medicine you gave me yesterday must've been effective.</font>

672
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,139
<font color="yellow">I brought you some porridge. You should eat it now.</font>

673
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,739
<font color="yellow">It's not like I really wanted to buy it for you.</font>

674
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:53,709
<font color="yellow">I just want you to get better soon so that you can work on that suit.</font>

675
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,969
<font color="yellow">I'll eat it later. I don't have any appetite right now.</font>

676
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:00,999
<font color="yellow">It's porridge, so just swallow it down.</font>

677
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,939
<font color="yellow">Gosh, your corny joke is giving me the chills.</font>

678
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,169
<font color="yellow">I think it was funny.</font>

679
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:18,999
<font color="yellow">Come on out!</font>

680
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,439
<font color="yellow">You really didn't have to do this.</font>

681
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,709
<font color="yellow">You must eat well when you're sick.</font>

682
00:43:29,939 --> 00:43:32,439
<font color="yellow">Chew well and eat all the porridge.</font>

683
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:42,799
<font color="yellow">How is it? Is it good?</font>

684
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:45,139
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's delicious.</font>

685
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:47,469
<font color="yellow">Eat the side dishes, too.</font>

686
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:54,339
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I said you should eat it with the side dishes.</font>

687
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,639
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

688
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:00,699
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

689
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,369
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is wrong with me?</font>

690
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:24,039
<font color="yellow">I tear up whenever I eat something delicious.</font>

691
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,369
<font color="yellow">It's an odd habit of mine.</font>

692
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,299
<font color="yellow">I'm silly, aren't I?</font>

693
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:32,269
<font color="yellow">Everyone already knows how silly you are.</font>

694
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,339
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be embarrassed.</font>

695
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:36,569
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

696
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,599
<font color="yellow">You don't mind eating together in the cafeteria, do you?</font>

697
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,199
<font color="yellow">You probably don't get to eat much at your gosiwon.</font>

698
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:33,939
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

699
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,499
<font color="yellow">I know you like bulgogi burgers.</font>

700
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:41,439
<font color="yellow">You must also like bulgogi.</font>

701
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,769
<font color="yellow">Am I right?</font>

702
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,569
<font color="yellow">I've had enough.</font>

703
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,739
<font color="yellow">I think there's a misunderstanding.</font>

704
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:00,339
<font color="yellow">I don't take you lightly because I'm the chairman's daughter.</font>

705
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:04,499
<font color="yellow">I'm not that immature.</font>

706
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:08,339
<font color="yellow">I'm a really nice person. You'll see once you get to know me.</font>

707
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,639
<font color="yellow">I'm done. I'll get going now.</font>

708
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,269
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go out with me?</font>

709
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:22,399
<font color="yellow">- What was that for? - I'm sorry.</font>

710
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:24,739
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

711
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:27,299
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

712
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:29,699
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

713
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:31,599
<font color="yellow">What's so surprising about that?</font>

714
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:34,439
<font color="yellow">Stop joking around, Ms Min.</font>

715
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:35,899
<font color="yellow">I'm not joking.</font>

716
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:38,039
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

717
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:40,869
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense for us to go out.</font>

718
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,269
<font color="yellow">Why does it not make sense?</font>

719
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,239
<font color="yellow">I'm surely your type of woman.</font>

720
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:46,939
<font color="yellow">I never said anything like that.</font>

721
00:46:46,939 --> 00:46:48,739
<font color="yellow">The lie detector did, though.</font>

722
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,469
<font color="yellow">It malfunctioned.</font>

723
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:54,739
<font color="yellow">I don't fall for people like you.</font>

724
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:58,669
<font color="yellow">What kind of person am I?</font>

725
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:00,799
<font color="yellow">You're self-centred. You have everything your way.</font>

726
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:03,139
<font color="yellow">I don't like people like that.</font>

727
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,539
<font color="yellow">I admit that I can be like that at times,</font>

728
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:12,399
<font color="yellow">but that's not all there is to me.</font>

729
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,769
<font color="yellow">- Stop being so judgmental. - I'll pretend I didn't...</font>

730
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:17,939
<font color="yellow">hear what you just said.</font>

731
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:28,599
<font color="yellow">How can he talk like that in front of my face?</font>

732
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,299
<font color="yellow">Does he hate me that much?</font>

733
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,669
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

734
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:56,399
<font color="yellow">Does he get any work done?</font>

735
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,069
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's quite competent.</font>

736
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:01,599
<font color="yellow">He has a good reputation among his colleagues, and he works hard.</font>

737
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:03,869
<font color="yellow">He's basically running the TF team.</font>

738
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:04,969
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

739
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:11,269
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

740
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:20,899
<font color="yellow">I just got a call from Ms Kim.</font>

741
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:22,539
<font color="yellow">I think they like you.</font>

742
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,569
<font color="yellow">That woman is a psycho.</font>

743
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,199
<font color="yellow">- Don't say that. - I'm a crazy person myself,</font>

744
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,269
<font color="yellow">but she's 10 times worse.</font>

745
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:32,939
<font color="yellow">She'll drive our family into ruins...</font>

746
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:34,599
<font color="yellow">if she becomes your daughter-in-law.</font>

747
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,069
<font color="yellow">Is she that bad?</font>

748
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,039
<font color="yellow">I'd rather live forever alone.</font>

749
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:40,939
<font color="yellow">I won't marry someone like that.</font>

750
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,869
<font color="yellow">- Mum, give Ji Yun a chance. - Hyo Sang!</font>

751
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:50,099
<font color="yellow">It's a little harsh of you to disapprove when you haven't met her.</font>

752
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:53,969
<font color="yellow">I thought about breaking up with her after taking your advice,</font>

753
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,969
<font color="yellow">but I can't. I just can't do that.</font>

754
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,269
<font color="yellow">Please, Mum? Please?</font>

755
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:06,369
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about yesterday.</font>

756
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:09,169
<font color="yellow">Give me a chance to explain what happened.</font>

757
00:49:09,669 --> 00:49:10,899
<font color="yellow">Jerk.</font>

758
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:15,799
<font color="yellow">Are you Choi Ji Yun?</font>

759
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:18,069
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's me.</font>

760
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,439
<font color="yellow">This is from Mr Min Hyo Sang of Meesa Apparel.</font>

761
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,469
<font color="yellow">Is that from your boyfriend?</font>

762
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:28,169
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun.</font>

763
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,899
<font color="yellow">I heard rumours about you and Meesa Apparel.</font>

764
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:31,999
<font color="yellow">I guess they were true.</font>

765
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:33,799
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

766
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:47,499
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Let's meet up and talk.</font>

767
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:52,499
<font color="yellow">Did you think some flowers would make me forgive you?</font>

768
00:49:52,899 --> 00:49:55,139
<font color="yellow">I'm not as easy as you think, Hyo Sang.</font>

769
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,069
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin's late.</font>

770
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:07,599
<font color="yellow">Looks like he got caught up at the hospital.</font>

771
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:10,769
<font color="yellow">Let's take a lunch break. I can't work when I'm hungry.</font>

772
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:11,839
<font color="yellow">You can eat.</font>

773
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:14,099
<font color="yellow">I have to get back home.</font>

774
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:16,439
<font color="yellow">Why? Is something wrong with Sun Nyeo?</font>

775
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:18,239
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't put it like that.</font>

776
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,199
<font color="yellow">I need to check on something.</font>

777
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,369
<font color="yellow">If she's not home at this time of the day,</font>

778
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,399
<font color="yellow">she has to be cheating.</font>

779
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:37,799
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dong Sook.</font>

780
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,769
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, Dae Sub?</font>

781
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:43,639
<font color="yellow">- Your mother said... - I said you should...</font>

782
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:45,769
<font color="yellow">ask about future dates through the middle-person.</font>

783
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:48,539
<font color="yellow">You can't be coming here to where I live.</font>

784
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,299
<font color="yellow">- It's not like that, Dong Sook. - Let's not do this here.</font>

785
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:52,739
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.</font>

786
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:55,239
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm not here to see you.</font>

787
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:56,739
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see your mother.</font>

788
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:59,999
<font color="yellow">Did you like me that much? We only met once.</font>

789
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,039
<font color="yellow">You can't meet Ms... I mean, you can't meet my mum already.</font>

790
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,969
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you're rushing things?</font>

791
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:08,169
<font color="yellow">We just met once. Don't you think your overreacting?</font>

792
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,439
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

793
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,269
<font color="yellow">- It's not like that. - Well, whatever it is,</font>

794
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,099
<font color="yellow">- let's just go somewhere quiet. - What are you talking about?</font>

795
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:16,769
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

796
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:18,439
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no. - Who are you?</font>

797
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:20,899
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, Honey?</font>

798
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:24,699
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Did you call him, "Honey"?</font>

799
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,799
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - I got you now.</font>

800
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:29,399
<font color="yellow">You live off by backstabbing innocent women, don't you?</font>

801
00:51:29,499 --> 00:51:31,369
<font color="yellow">That's why you're hitting on my wife, isn't it?</font>

802
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:32,999
<font color="yellow">"Wife"?</font>

803
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,899
<font color="yellow">- You two are married? - Yes.</font>

804
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,799
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - That woman is my wife.</font>

805
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:39,139
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

806
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,599
<font color="yellow">- You're a gold-digger, aren't you? - What did you say?</font>

807
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,739
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk that way about a charming woman like her.</font>

808
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:48,139
<font color="yellow">- Get your hands off of me. - How dare you call her that.</font>

809
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,269
<font color="yellow">- My gosh, get off of me. - Take it easy, you two.</font>

810
00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:51,439
<font color="yellow">Listen to what I have to say.</font>

811
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:52,999
<font color="yellow">- I can explain. - Let go of me.</font>

812
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:56,199
<font color="yellow">- What are you trying to do? - I'm going to break his legs.</font>

813
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,239
<font color="yellow">You're going to hit me? Please help!</font>

814
00:51:58,469 --> 00:51:59,939
<font color="yellow">Call the police!</font>

815
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:02,499
<font color="yellow">Call the police! He's trying to beat me!</font>

816
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:04,639
<font color="yellow">Call the police!</font>

817
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:06,669
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - Stop it, Honey.</font>

818
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:09,039
<font color="yellow">- Call the police, everyone. - Hold still.</font>

819
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:10,869
<font color="yellow">- What's going on here? - Who are you supposed to be?</font>

820
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,669
<font color="yellow">- Who am I? Who are you? - I'm Park Dae Sub. Who are you?</font>

821
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,169
<font color="yellow">- I'm the Terius of rock-ballad. - What does that mean?</font>

822
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:17,339
<font color="yellow">Hold him tight.</font>

823
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:41,199
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? I didn't mean to do that.</font>

824
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,539
<font color="yellow">Mr Park?</font>

825
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:45,499
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Do you know him?</font>

826
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,339
<font color="yellow">He's Mr Park who went on a date with Dong Sook.</font>

827
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,839
<font color="yellow">This is the guy...</font>

828
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,669
<font color="yellow">who went on a date with Dong Sook?</font>

829
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,369
<font color="yellow">Did he confuse her for Dong Sook?</font>

830
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:02,269
<font color="yellow">Are you cheating on Dong Sook?</font>

831
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,839
<font color="yellow">- What's going on here? - Look here.</font>

832
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:08,839
<font color="yellow">Did you set me up on a date...</font>

833
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:11,469
<font color="yellow">with a married woman?</font>

834
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:13,269
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

835
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:14,869
<font color="yellow">Who are you talking about?</font>

836
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:18,139
<font color="yellow">- I don't understand. - I'm talking about Dong Sook.</font>

837
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:22,199
<font color="yellow">What are you all doing out here?</font>

838
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,369
<font color="yellow">There you are, Dong Sook.</font>

839
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:29,739
<font color="yellow">This is Dong Sook?</font>

840
00:53:32,439 --> 00:53:34,139
<font color="yellow">- I thought she was Dong Sook. - What are you talking about?</font>

841
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:36,169
<font color="yellow">This is my daughter, Lee Dong Sook.</font>

842
00:53:37,169 --> 00:53:39,699
<font color="yellow">- Who's this then? - That's Bok Sun Nyeo.</font>

843
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:41,599
<font color="yellow">She lives upstairs.</font>

844
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:46,439
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

845
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:48,199
<font color="yellow">Who's that? Do you know him?</font>

846
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:15,739
<font color="yellow">I knew something wasn't right...</font>

847
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:17,499
<font color="yellow">when you said you don't like how she looks...</font>

848
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:19,469
<font color="yellow">and that she eats like a baby.</font>

849
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:21,399
<font color="yellow">I sensed something went wrong.</font>

850
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,699
<font color="yellow">That's why I called Mr Park over to our house.</font>

851
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,899
<font color="yellow">I wanted to talk to him to see if everything was true.</font>

852
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:31,239
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault. I'm really sorry, Ms Choi.</font>

853
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:34,169
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

854
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:38,139
<font color="yellow">Arranged dates aren't a joke. This is nonsense.</font>

855
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:40,339
<font color="yellow">What have you done to Mr Park?</font>

856
00:54:40,439 --> 00:54:45,369
<font color="yellow">I give you my sincere apologies on behalf of these young kids.</font>

857
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:46,899
<font color="yellow">I'm terribly sorry.</font>

858
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:48,039
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

859
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,169
<font color="yellow">Things like this can happen once in a while. I'm fine.</font>

860
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:56,639
<font color="yellow">Thank you for being so understanding.</font>

861
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:58,899
<font color="yellow">All things aside,</font>

862
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:02,499
<font color="yellow">the fact that the real Dong Sook isn't her,</font>

863
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:05,039
<font color="yellow">but is her,</font>

864
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,269
<font color="yellow">is making me feel much better now.</font>

865
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:12,799
<font color="yellow">It's such a relief. I'm very glad about this.</font>

866
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:14,839
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

867
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:16,099
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

868
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,799
<font color="yellow">You're my type of woman.</font>

869
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:20,899
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

870
00:55:21,899 --> 00:55:23,239
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

871
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:26,099
<font color="yellow">Please accept my bow, Ma'am.</font>

872
00:55:29,769 --> 00:55:30,799
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

873
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:33,199
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

874
00:55:33,399 --> 00:55:37,199
<font color="yellow">Would you please allow me to marry your daughter?</font>

875
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,739
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

876
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:42,739
<font color="yellow">You've just met her. Are you kidding me?</font>

877
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,569
<font color="yellow">This guy is out of his mind.</font>

878
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:48,239
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth. This is our family business, not yours.</font>

879
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:51,139
<font color="yellow">When I laid my eyes on her,</font>

880
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:52,899
<font color="yellow">I fell in love right away.</font>

881
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:55,039
<font color="yellow">Please allow me to marry her.</font>

882
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:57,769
<font color="yellow">I won't let her go through any kind of hardship.</font>

883
00:55:57,969 --> 00:56:00,299
<font color="yellow">I'll treat her like a queen.</font>

884
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,539
<font color="yellow">I want you to be my mother-in-law.</font>

885
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,369
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do next time?</font>

886
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:22,569
<font color="yellow">You never stop surprising me with that interesting brain of yours.</font>

887
00:56:22,669 --> 00:56:26,669
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make you jealous so you'd go to the hospital with me.</font>

888
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:29,939
<font color="yellow">You really are terrible.</font>

889
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:33,169
<font color="yellow">You looked really nervous back there.</font>

890
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:36,569
<font color="yellow">Your eyes looked fiery when you were grabbing him by the collar.</font>

891
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:38,169
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

892
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:41,239
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute. If you weren't seeing him,</font>

893
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,839
<font color="yellow">where did you go every night?</font>

894
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:45,299
<font color="yellow">I started working part-time at a fried-chicken restaurant.</font>

895
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,299
<font color="yellow">A fried-chicken restaurant?</font>

896
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:55,739
<font color="yellow">Don't take this the wrong way. It's not because I don't like you,</font>

897
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:58,839
<font color="yellow">but I'm not thinking of getting married again any time soon.</font>

898
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:01,169
<font color="yellow">Just give me...</font>

899
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:04,499
<font color="yellow">three dates.</font>

900
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:07,369
<font color="yellow">"I want to get married again so much."</font>

901
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:09,539
<font color="yellow">I'll make you say that.</font>

902
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:11,699
<font color="yellow">You're a confident guy.</font>

903
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:16,369
<font color="yellow">That's right. I have money.</font>

904
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,969
<font color="yellow">And look at how good I look.</font>

905
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,439
<font color="yellow">I have every right to be confident.</font>

906
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:23,699
<font color="yellow">So give me an answer.</font>

907
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:27,499
<font color="yellow">All I'm asking for is three dates.</font>

908
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:32,939
<font color="yellow">Sure. Give me a call later.</font>

909
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:34,769
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dong Sook.</font>

910
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:37,969
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to somewhere nice.</font>

<font color="yellow">Who's this guy?</font>

913
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,269
<font color="yellow">He's a hard working man who lives on rent upstairs.</font>

914
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:49,239
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about him at all.</font>

915
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:56,399
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the food.</font>

916
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:57,839
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

917
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,569
<font color="yellow">Getting proper rest is important when you have a cold.</font>

918
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,769
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about the shop. Get some rest. I'll get going.</font>

919
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:05,039
<font color="yellow">Don't come out.</font>

920
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:07,839
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

921
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,239
<font color="yellow">Why did you come out? It's cold outside.</font>

922
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:17,439
<font color="yellow">The sink is broken. I have to wash the dishes here.</font>

923
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,899
<font color="yellow">You have a cold. You shouldn't do that.</font>

924
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:22,669
<font color="yellow">It'll only take a couple of minutes.</font>

925
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:24,969
<font color="yellow">I'll fix the sink. Do you have the tools?</font>

926
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,939
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

927
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:35,099
<font color="yellow">The water's leaking because the plastic hose got worn out.</font>

928
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:36,899
<font color="yellow">I'll fix it in no time.</font>

929
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:39,439
<font color="yellow">Wrench.</font>

930
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,999
<font color="yellow">This is a screwdriver. Give me a wrench.</font>

931
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,139
<font color="yellow">This is a plier.</font>

932
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,869
<font color="yellow">Don't you know anything about tools?</font>

933
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:56,699
<font color="yellow">This is the wrench.</font>

934
00:58:57,999 --> 00:58:59,699
<font color="yellow">You must have a way with tools.</font>

935
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:03,299
<font color="yellow">I'm a man. It's natural for me to know.</font>

936
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:05,339
<font color="yellow">I'll fix it in no time.</font>

937
00:59:07,899 --> 00:59:09,669
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my gosh. - My gosh, it's cold!</font>

938
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:11,769
<font color="yellow">- Oh, gosh. - What happened?</font>

939
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:14,539
<font color="yellow">It broke. It broke. Oh, my.</font>

940
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,139
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

941
00:59:17,169 --> 00:59:18,399
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

942
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:21,069
<font color="yellow">This place will get flooded.</font>

943
00:59:21,069 --> 00:59:23,269
<font color="yellow">Something's not right. There's something wrong with it.</font>

944
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:24,739
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

945
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,039
<font color="yellow">Block it with this.</font>

946
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:29,939
<font color="yellow">- What? What do I do? - Over there.</font>

947
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:31,669
<font color="yellow">This isn't going to do the job.</font>

948
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,199
<font color="yellow">Just do it.</font>

949
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:35,569
<font color="yellow">- I blocked it. - Nice.</font>

950
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,299
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - That's good.</font>

951
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:45,899
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

952
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:54,039
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything bigger?</font>

953
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:57,939
<font color="yellow">That's the biggest one I have.</font>

954
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:02,239
<font color="yellow">That should do it.</font>

955
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,639
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

956
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,339
<font color="yellow">- Thank you so much. - No problem.</font>

957
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,999
<font color="yellow">Plumbing is much more complicated than it looks.</font>

958
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,299
<font color="yellow">Most guys would easily fix something like this.</font>

959
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:19,939
<font color="yellow">You just forgot to...</font>

960
01:00:19,939 --> 01:00:22,839
<font color="yellow">turn the water off before you started.</font>

961
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:24,669
<font color="yellow">It's common sense, really.</font>

962
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:34,639
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

963
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,999
<font color="yellow">You're late. Did you drop her off at the hospital?</font>

964
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:40,969
<font color="yellow">She was feeling better, so I didn't take her to the hospital.</font>

965
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:42,199
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

966
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:45,699
<font color="yellow">What are you wearing inside?</font>

967
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:49,369
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Did something happen?</font>

968
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:51,069
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

969
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:53,369
<font color="yellow">Can you give me a shirt I can change into?</font>

970
01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:56,739
<font color="yellow">You should be able to find something in the back.</font>

971
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:58,069
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

972
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:14,539
<font color="yellow">Why did I say I could fix it? This is so embarrassing.</font>

973
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:16,739
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.</font>

974
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:58,939
<font color="yellow">These are the 30 suits that made it to the final round.</font>

975
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,799
<font color="yellow">Now that we have a judge who studied fashion abroad,</font>

976
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,899
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it'll be a fair competition.</font>

977
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:06,339
<font color="yellow">What do I know?</font>

978
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,169
<font color="yellow">You can evaluate the tailoring and the needlework.</font>

979
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:12,139
<font color="yellow">I'll evaluate the design of the clothes.</font>

980
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:14,069
<font color="yellow">Let's get started.</font>

981
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:45,969
<font color="yellow">The tailoring and needlework are nicely done.</font>

982
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:47,739
<font color="yellow">This looks spotless.</font>

983
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:50,639
<font color="yellow">The sewing is perfect, too.</font>

984
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,039
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Ms Min?</font>

985
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:55,869
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about suits,</font>

986
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,899
<font color="yellow">but this one does stand out.</font>

987
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:00,969
<font color="yellow">It has a perfect balance and harmony.</font>

988
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:02,599
<font color="yellow">It's very vivid.</font>

989
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:06,199
<font color="yellow">No wonder it's so perfect.</font>

990
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:08,669
