00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, it appears to me that there was an incident near the Namsan Tower. I am wondering which hospital the patient might be gone to?</font>

48
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,520
<font color="yellow">Because it snowed there were many incidents and it will take sometime for more information.</font>

49

<font color="yellow">Name?</font>

60
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,040

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,600
<font color="yellow">Don't have one? I understand.</font>

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,480
<font color="yellow">Madame, the CEO has to pay his condolences to the family in mourning and in needs of a black tie.</font>

66
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,400
<font color="yellow">Did you get his message?</font>

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, I just now. We planned to have dinner together but had to cancel.</font>

68
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,320
<font color="yellow">So, I decided to be out as well.</font>

69
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:05,040
<font color="yellow">Uh, yes. I told her to have dinner at home but I forgot to call her.</font>

70
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,080
<font color="yellow">You've mentioned to my wife that I will be visiting a house of mourning?</font>

71
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,040
<font color="yellow">Yes. I did.</font>

72
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,240
<font color="yellow">Then, let's go.</font>

73
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

74
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
<font color="yellow">Is it here?</font>

75
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,120
<font color="yellow">Here! Here! HERE!</font>

76
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,480
<font color="yellow">Are you a guardian of her?</font>

77
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
<font color="yellow">This woman, have you checked her temperature?</font>

78
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,960
<font color="yellow">The basic exam was done a while ago, and she is in waiting for an exam of fractures. Please wait.</font>

79
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
<font color="yellow">Examined all?</font>

80
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,960
<font color="yellow">The child is cold like an ice! You sure done exam?</font>

81
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,080

<font color="yellow">Doctor! Doctor?</font>

83
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

84
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,360
<font color="yellow">This patient, can't check the vital and her temperature is 29!</font>

85
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,440
<font color="yellow">What a nonsense you're talking, what 29 degree!</font>

86
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,960
<font color="yellow">CPR. Please prepare the</font>

87
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

88
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,840
<font color="yellow">Patient! Patient! Can you hear me?</font>

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,320
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

93
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,440
<font color="yellow">alright?</font>

94
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,600
<font color="yellow">I had a dream.</font>

95
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,360
<font color="yellow">You held my hand.</font>

96
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,520
<font color="yellow">You saved me.</font>

97
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,480
<font color="yellow">Prepare the chest x-ray...</font>

98
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
<font color="yellow">Hey quickly quickly! As quick as possible!</font>

99
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,920
<font color="yellow">Hey, where do you think Joon Jae go earlier? I think he went to a club.</font>

100
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,840
<font color="yellow">After having kicked that seriously vapid Cheong out, he's gone out to play.</font>

101
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,760
<font color="yellow">As the saying Cheong-Chul-Uh-Ram (Blue comes from Indigo), Joon Jae who learned bad things from me became worse than I am.</font>

102
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,720
<font color="yellow">Why [are you calling] you nastier jerk?</font>

103
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, he's asking for a fake ID with an insurance coverage.</font>

104
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,920
<font color="yellow">He says he doesn't want to.</font>

105
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's not like you're making him donate his talent, don't make him do something so trivial.</font>

106
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,240
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're going to pay him by the hour. What?</font>

107
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,520
<font color="yellow">Cheong is in the ER?</font>

108
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,040
<font color="yellow">Wh... wh... why? A traffic accident?</font>

109
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,600
<font color="yellow">Ah, right. Since she's undocumented.</font>

110
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,440
<font color="yellow">Of course she needs an ID. An ID!</font>

111
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
<font color="yellow">Are you, really okay?</font>

112
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,120
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, did you worry about me?</font>

113
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

114
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,360
<font color="yellow">- Really? - I said yes.</font>

115
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,480
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

116
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,520
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

117
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,040
<font color="yellow">if something bad were to happen to you, being that you're an unknown person without a home and a family,</font>

118
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,360
<font color="yellow">it'll become really plagued.</font>

119
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,120
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae DID worry about me.</font>

120
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,240
<font color="yellow">Did it never occur to you to avoid an on-coming car?</font>

121
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,440
<font color="yellow">You held my hand earlier because you were worried about me, right?</font>

122
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,800
<font color="yellow">Don't you see that I'm scolding you right now?</font>

123
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,400
<font color="yellow">When you cross the street, please look both ways.</font>

124
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,200
<font color="yellow">What did you do so well that you'd scold her?</font>

125
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,000
<font color="yellow">This is all because you kicked Cheong out of the house!</font>

126
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you look at a person in that manner, huh?</font>

127
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,760
<font color="yellow">Ah, move over. Are you okay, Cheong? How did you get hurt, Cheong?</font>

128
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
<font color="yellow">We worried a lot about on our way over here.</font>

129
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,600
<font color="yellow">Ah, enough of that. Did you make the thing I asked for?</font>

130
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
<font color="yellow">Of course we made it, we did. But how come...</font>

131
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,400
<font color="yellow">Ah, stop making her talk. The doctor said it's not good for her to talk a lot.</font>

132
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,800
<font color="yellow">You said she hurt her legs, but she shouldn't speak?</font>

133
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
<font color="yellow">[The doctor] said no.</font>

134
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,600
<font color="yellow">- Does that sound right? - They said it's possible.</font>

135
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
<font color="yellow">So just go and take the appropriate procedure [to be discharged].</font>

136
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,480
<font color="yellow">Rest up, Cheong.</font>

137
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="yellow">Just go on.</font>

138
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,480
<font color="yellow">I'm here to take care of the ER patient Sim Cheong's discharge procedure.</font>

139
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,760
<font color="yellow">Here's her ID and her insurance card.</font>

140
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,960
<font color="yellow">Hey, that female patient on traffic accident whose body temperature was 29 celsius, is it true that she was resuscitated after one shock?</font>

141
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,040
<font color="yellow">Don't even mention it, Man. I thought she expired (died).</font>

142
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,760
<font color="yellow">- I nearly pronounced a perfectly fine person dead. - I bet you were scared sh!tless.</font>

143
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,840
<font color="yellow">By the way, even the name of that patient is unique. What was she called again? Choon Hyang?</font>

144
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,120
<font color="yellow">No, Sim Cheong.</font>

145
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,360
<font color="yellow">As the test came back negative to alcohol or drug, and because you reported it immediately the first aid to the injured was carried out speedily,</font>

146
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
<font color="yellow">you won't face any major issues, should you settle the matter with the other party well.</font>

147
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,240
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.  Where is the injured party?</font>

148
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,400
<font color="yellow">Ah, there...</font>

149
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,120
<font color="yellow">Was that you who hit her with a car?</font>

150
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,720
<font color="yellow">You?</font>

151
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,480
<font color="yellow">Heo, Jun Jae! I'm your older brother!</font>

152
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,400
<font color="yellow">An older brother, what a joke!</font>

153
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,800
<font color="yellow">Let's not pretend to be this non-existent family, and answer my question.</font>

154
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
<font color="yellow">Did you hit her with a car?</font>

155
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,520
<font color="yellow">That lady jumped into road. It was a chance accident.</font>

156
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,360
<font color="yellow">- It was a chance accident.</font>

157
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
<font color="yellow">- A chance?</font>

158
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,040
<font color="yellow">You're saying it was a chance accident?</font>

159
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,840
<font color="yellow">It was just that, I came to borrow your MP3, without not knowing this was on your desk</font>

160
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,240
<font color="yellow">and hit it with my elbow by accident. I'm really sorry.</font>

161
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,680
<font color="yellow">Father, I'm sorry.</font>

162
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,280
<font color="yellow">It can happen to anyone.</font>

163
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,600
<font color="yellow">You, didn't I tell you to throw that away, a long time ago!</font>

164
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,000
<font color="yellow">The broken pieces would be its surroundings if it were a mistake.</font>

165
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,640
<font color="yellow">Not all over the fragments be and even the holder got broken..</font>

166
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,920
<font color="yellow">This meant you dropped with your intention to break.</font>

167
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,360
<font color="yellow">Ah! No! Truly, trust me.</font>

168
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,400
<font color="yellow">Enough! Stop!</font>

169
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,920
<font color="yellow">Did you know how much I felt sorry for your mother cleaning this picture frame without telling you to get rid of it?</font>

170
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,800
<font color="yellow">Well done. You clean them!</font>

171
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, you punks!</font>

172
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,080
<font color="yellow">Why you rotten... Hey Chi Hyeon!</font>

173
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
<font color="yellow">Let me see. Are you hurt a lot?</font>

174
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,240
<font color="yellow">God, look at this.</font>

175
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
<font color="yellow">You rotten punk.</font>

176
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,920
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the hospital.</font>

177
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,000
<font color="yellow">There is no such thing as a coincidence to you.</font>

178
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,080
<font color="yellow">That I know for certain.</font>

179
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,520
<font color="yellow">Don't be irrational. Then are you supposing that I hit her on purpose?</font>

180
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,280
<font color="yellow">You don't usually drive yourself as a norm.</font>

181
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,720
<font color="yellow">The fact that you were driving yourself says that you were headed for some place private unmentionable to others.</font>

182
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,560
<font color="yellow">Writing a fiction?</font>

183
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
<font color="yellow">Say it! Have you track me down?</font>

184
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
<font color="yellow">Then, hit her?</font>

185
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,280
<font color="yellow">Huh, what a nonsense...</font>

186
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,000
<font color="yellow">While ago, you are the one who hired a person to track me down?</font>

187
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
<font color="yellow">If not, your mother?</font>

188
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,160
<font color="yellow">Don't...</font>

189
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,400
<font color="yellow">just say anything! Why my mother would hired a person to follow you?</font>

190
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,960
<font color="yellow">You not that interested!</font>

191
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,560
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

192
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,600
<font color="yellow">I'm my father's real son!</font>

193
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,640
<font color="yellow">Go on and do your filial duty. We both know that's your true work.</font>

194
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,440
<font color="yellow">Go and pretend playing at being a real son to the fake father.</font>

195
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,480
<font color="yellow">Stop appearing in my presence.</font>

196
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

197
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, the investigation just ended.</font>

198
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,680
<font color="yellow">Ah, don't worry too much.</font>

199
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,480
<font color="yellow">I told you I'm not hurt anywhere.</font>

200
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,800
<font color="yellow">Ah, let's go then.</font>

201
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,200
<font color="yellow">- Is it this way? - Yes.</font>

202
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,360
<font color="yellow">Now, Sim Cheong, let's get off.</font>

203
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
<font color="yellow">They say there were a lot of car accidents because of the snow.</font>

204
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,160
<font color="yellow">So they said they don't have any single rooms available so let's just stay here for now.</font>

205
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,120
<font color="yellow">Then am I going to live here?</font>

206
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,880
<font color="yellow">Not living per se, just staying for a while.</font>

207
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
<font color="yellow">With all the people here?</font>

208
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

209
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,080
<font color="yellow">What's marriage?</font>

210
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,200
<font color="yellow">Marriage, is a man and woman who live together under one roof because they love each other.</font>

211
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,480
<font color="yellow">Loving each other and taking care of each other.</font>

212
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,240
<font color="yellow">Then am I married to these people?</font>

213
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,560
<font color="yellow">- Huh? - They say a man and woman living under one roof</font>

214
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,000
<font color="yellow">loving each other and taking care of each other, that's marriage, isn't it?</font>

215
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
<font color="yellow">It's different from freeloading!</font>

216
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
<font color="yellow">I know what there's to know too.</font>

217
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
<font color="yellow">Let's sleep, alright-</font>

218
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,120
<font color="yellow">No! Wait!</font>

219
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,680
<font color="yellow">Are we all married now?</font>

220
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,920
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy. Today, I'll be married here.</font>

221
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,160
<font color="yellow">And next time, I'll marry Heo Joon Jae.</font>

222
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,520
<font color="yellow">Let's proceed with an MRI scan on the brain for that patient.</font>

223
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,000
<font color="yellow">Yes sir.</font>

224
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,480
<font color="yellow">She's cute.</font>

225
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,360
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Lee Da Bong! - Here.</font>

226
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,480
<font color="yellow">Because of your diabetes, you have a restriction of 1700 calories.</font>

227
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's a calorie controlled meal? Looks good</font>

228
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,360
<font color="yellow">It smells nice, it'll probably taste very savory</font>

229
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,440
<font color="yellow">don't you think?</font>

230
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,840
<font color="yellow">Before the special gets cold.</font>

231
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
<font color="yellow">This is spicy mussel stew with noodles.</font>

232
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
<font color="yellow">That's the special?</font>

233
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,960
<font color="yellow">Oh my, the mussels...They don't usually open their mouths like that but I see today they all have their mouths open.</font>

234
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,280
<font color="yellow">You were right to order the special, it looks good.</font>

235
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,000
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

236
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

237
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,880
<font color="yellow">Ms. Sim Cheong, you've been ordered a fasting.</font>

238
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm fasting? Please give me the fasting.</font>

239
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,440
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be delicious. Thank you, I'll eat well.</font>

240
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
<font color="yellow">It's fasting. You get no food.</font>

241
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,520
<font color="yellow">I get...no food?</font>

242
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,280
<font color="yellow">There's a chance you might have to go into surgery, so I've been told you have to wait on an empty belly.</font>

243
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,800
<font color="yellow">So you're fasting.</font>

244
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,840
<font color="yellow">What? Why're you calling me?</font>

245
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,880
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, what do I do...</font>

246
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,760
<font color="yellow">Something big happened...</font>

247
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,080
<font color="yellow">What?!</font>

248
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
<font color="yellow">I got an order to fast.</font>

249
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,440
<font color="yellow">Other people get normal meals</font>

250
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,840
<font color="yellow">calorie controlled meals, special meals but I was the only one that got fasting.</font>

251
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,440
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, what do I do?</font>

252
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,520
<font color="yellow">What do you mean what. It's probably because you might have to get surgery.</font>

253
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,880
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae. I'm on standby, on an empty stomach.</font>

254
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
<font color="yellow">I got it, so just sleep.</font>

255
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,280
<font color="yellow">When I close my eyes, it goes back and forth in my sight.</font>

256
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,160
<font color="yellow">- What does? - Spicy stew with noodles.</font>

257
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,880
<font color="yellow">- You're a real handful. - Because of the spicy stew with noodles</font>

258
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,200
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep...</font>

259
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,000
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae...</font>

260
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,480
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae left.</font>

261
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,640
<font color="yellow">No, I'm saying-the patient's mental state is back to normal and it's not like she's got some excessive bleeding.</font>

262
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,840
<font color="yellow">Just looking at the potential of an emergency operation</font>

263
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,320
<font color="yellow">and putting her on standby on an empty stomach just doesn't seem right to me, is all I'm saying.</font>

264
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
<font color="yellow">It's just a precaution-but what the heck</font>

265
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
<font color="yellow">are you a doctor?</font>

266
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
<font color="yellow">Is that what's important right now?</font>

267
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,320
<font color="yellow">And on top of that, the basic process of ordering a fast for a patient</font>

268
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,640
<font color="yellow">involves informing the patient first, isn't it?! No, I'm saying</font>

269
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
<font color="yellow">you suddenly cut off a kid's happiness when all it comes from is food!</font>

270
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,480
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, her mental state's gonna plunge like this! If she goes insane, are you going to take responsibility for her!?</font>

271
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,360
<font color="yellow">Ms. Sim Cheong, you have a special meal for this morning.</font>

272
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,880
<font color="yellow">Spicy stew with noodles.</font>

273
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing.</font>

274
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,040
<font color="yellow">Are you happy about this right now?!</font>

275
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,840
<font color="yellow">Dude. Stop. Stop it.</font>

276
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you happy about that ball of chaos getting some spicy stew with noodles?!</font>

277
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
<font color="yellow">- What is it now? - Heo Joon Jae!</font>

278
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,960
<font color="yellow">I just got the special meal.</font>

279
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,760
<font color="yellow">So what? I'm busy, hangup.</font>

280
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,200
<font color="yellow">Our Joon Jae got more charming than ever before.</font>

281
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
<font color="yellow">Punk.</font>

282
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,600
<font color="yellow">How could you just move away and cut off all contacts like that.</font>

283
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,080
<font color="yellow">Sorry Ajusshi.</font>

284
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,680
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

285
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,320
<font color="yellow">It's citrus tea.</font>

286
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,480
<font color="yellow">You liked the one my wife made.</font>

287
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,800
<font color="yellow">Mix it in water so you don't catch a cold.</font>

288
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,800
<font color="yellow">And make sure to dress warm this winter.</font>

289
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
<font color="yellow">Mommy!</font>

290
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,480
<font color="yellow">1998 Winter Mom!</font>

291
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,360
<font color="yellow">Drink this, if you keep crying, it'll hurt your throat.</font>

292
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,920
<font color="yellow">Ajusshi!</font>

293
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,520
<font color="yellow">Please bring my mom!</font>

294
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,480
<font color="yellow">This Ajusshi is really sorry for not being able to bring your mom.</font>

295
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,840
<font color="yellow">But instead, this Ajusshi will protect you, always-</font>

296
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,720
<font color="yellow">Who are you to do that?!</font>

297
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,480
<font color="yellow">Ajusshi...is your friend.</font>

298
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,680
<font color="yellow">I don't need any of that!</font>

299
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,920
<font color="yellow">Bring my mom!</font>

300
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,280
<font color="yellow">Bring my mom...</font>

301
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
<font color="yellow">Go that way.</font>

302
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,640
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

303
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,200
<font color="yellow">I'm gonna leave this house.</font>

304
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,840
<font color="yellow">Then what about your father?</font>

305
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,720
<font color="yellow">Even if he is like that on the outside, on the inside, he knows he doesn't have anyone but you.</font>

306
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,400
<font color="yellow">Father has you.</font>

307
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,480
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave and I'm going to find my mom.</font>

308
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to buy a really nice house and I'm going to live in it with my mom.</font>

309
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,880
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

310
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,200
<font color="yellow">Ajusshi, please protect my father.</font>

311
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,000
<font color="yellow">Ajusshi, you kept your promise but I still haven't kept mine.</font>

312
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,000
<font color="yellow">Your father is looking for you.</font>

313
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,520
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's thinking of cleaning up the things around him.</font>

314
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,520
<font color="yellow">Tell him to clean up and take me out of the equation.</font>

315
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,320
<font color="yellow">Ajusshi, I'll be going now.</font>

316
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,720
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the way it's supposed to be? At least for families.</font>

317
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,200
<font color="yellow">Even when they're sorry they find it hard to say the word, and when they miss you it's even harder to say so.</font>

318
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,640
<font color="yellow">Your father is just like that, and he's aged so much.</font>

319
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,040
<font color="yellow">I'll drink this well. Please go back safe.</font>

320
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,400
<font color="yellow">Your father</font>

321
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,840
<font color="yellow">- is - It's the CEO</font>

322
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,680
<font color="yellow">the CEO.</font>

323
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,760
<font color="yellow">How did you know?!</font>

324
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,480
<font color="yellow">This isn't the first time I've watched dramas.</font>

325
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,960
<font color="yellow">When they've lost their father or were separated when young</font>

326
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,120
<font color="yellow">it's 100%, 100% the CEO!</font>

327
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,800
<font color="yellow">It's not even the president of the company, it's always the CEO.</font>

328
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,280
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

329
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,040
<font color="yellow">What do you mean why, that's just how it is!</font>

330
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,760
<font color="yellow">I really love Kyuhyun-sshi.</font>

331
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,480
<font color="yellow">- Break up with my son this instant! - She won't take that.</font>

332
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,760
<font color="yellow">- I can't accept this. - Oh my, she's bount to get hit with water.</font>

333
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,640
<font color="yellow">What!?</font>

334
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,320
<font color="yellow">How do you know everything?!</font>

335
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,440
<font color="yellow">You see the water on the table? They didn't put it there to drink it.</font>

336
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,400
<font color="yellow">That's there to splash it in her face when she doesn't take the money.</font>

337
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,880
<font color="yellow">You get hit with water when you don't take an envelope of money? I can't get hit with water.</font>

338
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,360
<font color="yellow">You're not the only one can't get hit with water-no one should!</font>

339
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,040
<font color="yellow">I'll really be in lots of trouble.</font>

340
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,440
<font color="yellow">But, that person, why is she throwing the water?</font>

341
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,920
<font color="yellow">It's the whole "I can't give my son to you"-she's saying she can't accept her as a family member.</font>

342
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,400
<font color="yellow">What's a "family"?</font>

343
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,960
<font color="yellow">Are you asking because you really don't know? What do you mean what's a family!</font>

344
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,240
<font color="yellow">The people who are taking care of each other, they're family.</font>

345
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,880
<font color="yellow">So family are like red-bean fish-pastry.</font>

346
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,920
<font color="yellow">They look just like each other, just like fish-pastry</font>

347
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,320
<font color="yellow">and they're warm and sweet.</font>

348
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,480
<font color="yellow">It's weird, isn't it? Very weird? Weird from all angles?</font>

349
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,640
<font color="yellow">Whether we're talking about the mental state or physical state.</font>

350
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,520
<font color="yellow">The truth is, even with this accident. They said she wouldn't be able to recover like that but she's already flying around.</font>

351
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,920
<font color="yellow">It's strange.</font>

352
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,160
<font color="yellow">Oh my, what's going on-is she a zombie or what?</font>

353
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,320
<font color="yellow">And I was bit by someone like her.</font>

354
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,680
<font color="yellow">You should get a preventive shot, just in case.</font>

355
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,400
<font color="yellow">But why's Joon Jae around, acting like her guardian? It should've been done when he kicked her out once.</font>

356
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,640
<font color="yellow">He thinks the reason he can't remember what happened in Spain is connected to her.</font>

357
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,120
<font color="yellow">And he's probably just curious about that enigmatic bundle of a woman.</font>

358
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,400
<font color="yellow">I'm curious too. What in the world is she?</font>

359
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,280
<font color="yellow">I've been coming up with ideas. Don't you think it's something like, "heiress who's lost her memory" or something?</font>

360
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,440
<font color="yellow">And her physique is super strong because she ate a lot of wild ginseng or something.</font>

361
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,880
<font color="yellow">Where can you see that in her? At the blink of an eye, you know she's poor.</font>

362
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,520
<font color="yellow">Demanding the truth behind the medical accident! Please tell me why my daughter died!</font>

363
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,120
<font color="yellow">Chief, welcome back.</font>

364
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,640
<font color="yellow">You, are you in your right mind? Didn't you hear that President Lee's son was returning from London?</font>

365
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,760
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to get rid of trash like that!</font>

366
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

367
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

368
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,680
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I said clean up!</font>

369
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,040
<font color="yellow">Chief, that woman suddenly lost her daughter, so I think she feels wronged.</font>

370
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,720
<font color="yellow">So as a parent, I too-</font>

371
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,000
<font color="yellow">Who the hell gives you your paycheck. This hospital or that woman?</font>

372
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,440
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey! What?</font>

373
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
<font color="yellow">Chief!</font>

374
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,960
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

375
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,360
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make that patient starve too?! Empty stomachs are horrifying!</font>

376
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,880
<font color="yellow">Does this make sense? You said she's a patient with a fractured bone.</font>

377
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,880
<font color="yellow">When we checked in the emergency room, it was definitely a tibia fracture.</font>

378
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,320
<font color="yellow">Can't you see me flying off? Even a national representative in taekwondo can't make someone fly off like that!</font>

379
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,280
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

380
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,920
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

381
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,800
<font color="yellow">- Give and take.   - What?</font>

382
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,440
<font color="yellow">This man gave another man a kick in the leg so I gave him a kick in the leg.</font>

383
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? Is she delusional?</font>

384
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,400
<font color="yellow">We were thinking the same, so we've decided to proceed with an MRI scan for her brain.</font>

385
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,720
<font color="yellow">Contact the law firm and tell Attorney Oh to get here. And start all over from the x-ray!</font>

386
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,360
<font color="yellow">I'll report to the police and let you eat bean (prison) food properly!</font>

387
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,360
<font color="yellow">What'd she say.</font>

388
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,320
<font color="yellow">She asked...if bean food was good.</font>

389
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,840
<font color="yellow">[Trying to find the truth behind a medical accident]</font>

390
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,800
<font color="yellow">You're in a tight spot because of me, right?</font>

391
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

392
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you so sad?</font>

393
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,960
<font color="yellow">Our Ae Yeon,</font>

394
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,360
<font color="yellow">was so kind. She didn't even go on a school trip so she could help her mom.</font>

395
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,000
<font color="yellow">They said it would be a simple surgery.</font>

396
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,360
<font color="yellow">If I had known that she would never wake up again,</font>

397
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,160
<font color="yellow">I should've done everything for her. I should've sent her on that trip by force,</font>

398
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,040
<font color="yellow">I should've bought her a lot of pretty clothes.</font>

399
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,440
<font color="yellow">I should have told her to play around instead of working part-time jobs.</font>

400
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,080
<font color="yellow">Because I keep thinking about the things I haven't been able to do for her,</font>

401
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,440
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep and I can't eat. Ae Yeon...</font>

402
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,080
<font color="yellow">Would you like to hear my secret?</font>

403
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,680
<font color="yellow">I can erase human memories.</font>

404
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,920
<font color="yellow">If you would like me to, I can erase all of your sad memories.</font>

405
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,000
<font color="yellow">If you don't remember your daughter, then you won't be sad and hurting.</font>

406
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,960
<font color="yellow">I will do it for you.</font>

407
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,520
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving for school!</font>

408
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,760
<font color="yellow">Mom, I don't need to go on that educational trip. I'm fine, really.</font>

409
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,080
<font color="yellow">Our mom smells good.</font>

410
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,320
<font color="yellow">Ah, really. Did you finish your homework?</font>

411
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
<font color="yellow">Of course I did, who am I.</font>

412
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
<font color="yellow">Mom, aren't I funny?</font>

413
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,120
<font color="yellow">- You're not funny.  - Mom, when I'm done with my surgery, let's go to Jeju Island.</font>

414
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,520
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be outside, so don't worry.</font>

415
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,000
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

416
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,240
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

417
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,160
<font color="yellow">I will keep her in my heart,</font>

418
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,360
<font color="yellow">no matter how much it hurts, until I die.</font>

419
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,680
<font color="yellow">Why? Why would you keep her in your heart when it hurts?</font>

420
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,920
<font color="yellow">Because even if it hurts,</font>

421
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,760
<font color="yellow">I can love her.</font>

422
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,440
<font color="yellow">More than not being able to love and remember my daughter,</font>

423
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,840
<font color="yellow">I would rather love</font>

424
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,760
<font color="yellow">and remember her. Even if it hurts.</font>

425
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,360
<font color="yellow">- Ow! - Wow, he went really far! Didn't you say she has a broken bone?</font>

426
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,120
<font color="yellow">- I did. - What is this then, "The Miracle of Sim Cheong?</font>

427
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,720
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Maybe the scans got switched or something.</font>

428
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,280
<font color="yellow">Anyway, what are you going to do? The chief that was hit is threatening to sue Sim Cheong.</font>

429
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,880
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

430
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,120
<font color="yellow">Look at it, she's supposed to have a broken bone but she's flying! Something is weird!</font>

431
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, but look here. When I was watching before</font>

432
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,000
<font color="yellow">look at this guy, he should've gotten kicked!</font>

433
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,520
<font color="yellow">But well, whatever, if you don't wanna then there's no reason for me to well.</font>

434
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,480
<font color="yellow">- Hyung. You know what I hate the most in the world, right? - Right. Not saying hi and bye.</font>

435
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,240
<font color="yellow">Not that! There's something else: No manners.</font>

436
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,040
<font color="yellow">- Oh you were like that? - Yeah I was! I always put a lot of weight on respect.</font>

437
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,040
<font color="yellow">- Oh you did? - Yeah, I did! I can look over Sim Cheong doing this but I just can't look past this one.</font>

438
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,080
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

439
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,160
<font color="yellow">Let's empty him. This human being with absolutely no manners.</font>

440
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,880
<font color="yellow">The president of this hospital, Lee, is on vacation in Hawaii right now. So the son's flying back for the first time in 10 years.</font>

441
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,800
<font color="yellow">"Dad I'm at the hospital. But no one's at the airport." So that he can inherit rights for management.</font>

442
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,200
<font color="yellow">In the Chief's position, God's coming. The presence of an absolute authority.</font>

443
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,920
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Chairman. - Hey Assistant Director, didn't all the staff go to the airport?</font>

444
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. They are all out there standing by.</font>

445
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,560
<font color="yellow">My son is said to have arrived already! What's going on?!</font>

446
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,680
<font color="yellow">Director Yi Hyeon Dong I presume?</font>

447
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,800
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes, yes, yes. William Choi.</font>

448
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,000
<font color="yellow">Forget it!</font>

449
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,560
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry about the airport.</font>

450
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,360
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure where and how it was mixed up, but I'm sorry nevertheless.</font>

451
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,640
<font color="yellow">Daddy said I should "phone call" him, but my "battery" is out.</font>

452
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,040
<font color="yellow">Chairman.</font>

453
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,880
<font color="yellow">Ah, Dad? I arrived.</font>

454
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,800
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I waited at the airport for two hours, then rode  a taxi here. Geez, I'm so annoyed.</font>

455
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,440
<font color="yellow">What? Don't do that. Don't cut (fire) him.</font>

456
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,720
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to cut a person?! Really, I'm fine.</font>

457
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,200
<font color="yellow">Assistant Director's Office</font>

458
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,080
<font color="yellow">Ah, William Choi?</font>

459
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,840
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. I'll be escorting you to the hospital comfortably. Won't you come this way.</font>

460
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,400
<font color="yellow">In that time, I'll take the real William for a drive.</font>

461
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,080
<font color="yellow">Um, where are you going now?</font>

462
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,680
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get around to update my navigation software</font>

463
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,000
<font color="yellow">so I took a wrong turn, and it seems we're on a highway.</font>

464
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,440
<font color="yellow">While we play for time, Tae Ho will change the file between the Assistant Director's cell phone and the PC.</font>

465
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,000
<font color="yellow">You'd be able to notice just by sniffing a few voice mail and e-mail content.</font>

466
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,760
<font color="yellow">Search results.  - Yae Eun Kim patient record - Yae Eun Kim patient record revision</font>

467
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,520
<font color="yellow">- To erase the surgery report re patient's death...</font>

468
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,640
<font color="yellow">Gawd the smell...</font>

469
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,240
<font color="yellow">God. There's some sort of disgusting smell.</font>

470
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,480
<font color="yellow">Ah... it must be the smell of disinfectant.</font>

471
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,880
<font color="yellow">As we put such emphasis on disinfection that...</font>

472
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,920
<font color="yellow">Gawd. The smell's from you, Assistant Director.</font>

473
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,160
<font color="yellow">Disgusting. Shit...</font>

474
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,920
<font color="yellow">Um... it must be because I have a chronic gastiritis.</font>

475
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,000
<font color="yellow">But you know, the smell doesn't disappear even when you shut your mouth.</font>

476
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,800
<font color="yellow">Our Assistant Director must be fishy (pun) in some way.</font>

477
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,520
<font color="yellow">- I'm not sure what you mean by... - Oh my god!</font>

478
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,800
<font color="yellow">Please stop talking.</font>

479
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,080
<font color="yellow">Who are you guys?</font>

480
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,360
<font color="yellow">You aren't the Chairman's son, are you?</font>

481
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,760
<font color="yellow">The fishy smell must have originated from here.</font>

482
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,480
<font color="yellow">Medical negligence, embezzlement, accost bribes,</font>

483
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,520
<font color="yellow">Wow, this one would cause a serious trouble if your wife found out.</font>

484
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,840
<font color="yellow">Personally, I detest a person who doesn't do his familial duty. (people who have affairs)</font>

485
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,960
<font color="yellow">I guess the pharmaceutical companies give their rebate by holding a golf tournament these days.</font>

486
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,600
<font color="yellow">1 round is 1,000,000 Won, then 1 day would be 1 Million...?</font>

487
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,560
<font color="yellow">Well, of course they will lose on purpose.</font>

488
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,600
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

489
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,360
<font color="yellow">What would you like to do? Shall I disclose all that is here to the reporters?</font>

490
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,960
<font color="yellow">Hurry, please. He has a hand tremor.</font>

491
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,040
<font color="yellow">How much would you be wanting...?</font>

492
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,000
<font color="yellow">Ah, what, you'd like to resolve this with money?</font>

493
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,960
<font color="yellow">That sure is a good attitude, but</font>

494
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,560
<font color="yellow">I won't be receiving any money on this, as it is the end of the year (holidays). Instead, won't you do a good deed?</font>

495
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,360
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes, of course. Whatever it is.</font>

496
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,440
<font color="yellow">Firstly, you know that unusual woman of high kick?</font>

497
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,360
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Go easy on her please.</font>

498
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,560
<font color="yellow">Ah, for that small deed. I'll be do her a favor.</font>

499
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,520
<font color="yellow">It didn't hurt too much.</font>

500
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,480
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

501
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,320
<font color="yellow">And also, I saw as I was coming up...</font>

502
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,480
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

503
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,400
<font color="yellow">I was... sorry, last time.</font>

504
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,320
<font color="yellow">I request the truth in medical malpractice. Please tell me why my daughter died.</font>

505
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,000
<font color="yellow">This is... the original record of the surgery.</font>

506
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,880
<font color="yellow">Treatment History/Record</font>

507
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,440
<font color="yellow">It is indeed our medical error (malpractice).</font>

508
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,520
<font color="yellow">There was a mistake in mid-surgery,</font>

509
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,200
<font color="yellow">and because we were unable to properly monitor the patient status post surgery that</font>

510
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,600
<font color="yellow">we caused your daughter to die as you suspected rightly.</font>

511
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,960
<font color="yellow">We are at fault.</font>

512
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,520
<font color="yellow">Any future legal procedure and the compensation would be with our legal department.</font>

513
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,920
<font color="yellow">I'm truly sorry.</font>

514
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,360
<font color="yellow">Oops. A mistake.</font>

515
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,320
<font color="yellow">You're such a...</font>

516
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,760
<font color="yellow">What's good for a hand tremor, by the way?</font>

517
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,680
<font color="yellow">I really like the hospital.</font>

518
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,120
<font color="yellow">Food is delicious, and it's not cold.</font>

519
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,720
<font color="yellow">Come now, how can the hospital food delicious? It's so plain.</font>

520
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,040
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't this open?</font>

521
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,320
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you're so strong!</font>

522
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,160
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see you're having a meal.</font>

523
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,560
<font color="yellow">You're taking your meal well and not suffering from anything?</font>

524
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,960
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

525
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,000
<font color="yellow">Ms. Sim Cheong, as you're fine, you may be discharged.</font>

526
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,280
<font color="yellow">- What is being discharged? - I'm saying that you may "return to your original place" (go home).</font>

527
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,480
<font color="yellow">What is "Return to original place"?</font>

528
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,520
<font color="yellow">Going home, you know.</font>

529
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,200
<font color="yellow">Is it because I ate too much?</font>

530
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,240
<font color="yellow">I see that's how it is. Would I be able to stay if I don't eat?</font>

531
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,600
<font color="yellow">Ah, no. That's not what I mean.</font>

532
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,160
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't have a home.</font>

533
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,440
<font color="yellow">I can't go home...</font>

534
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

535
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,240
<font color="yellow">Let's go, home, I said.</font>

536
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,560
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

537
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,720
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey.</font>

538
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,160
<font color="yellow">Doctor. is it okay for her to run like this?</font>

539
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, we did an overall checkup and she's fine. She can run a marathon.</font>

540
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,040
<font color="yellow">Is this possible?</font>

541
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,080
<font color="yellow">Possibly there was a mistake at the ER and the x-ray might have been switched.</font>

542
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,120
<font color="yellow">Almost never is there such incidence. I'm really sorry.</font>

543
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,640
<font color="yellow">Are you alright?</font>

544
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,840
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

545
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,680
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, when does the first snow fall?</font>

546
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,920
<font color="yellow">The first snow comes once a year.</font>

547
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,120
<font color="yellow">This year's first snow has come and gone. It'll come next year.</font>

548
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,720
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

549
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,560
<font color="yellow">Then I guess I won't be able to see the first snow.</font>

550
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,040
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

551
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,640
<font color="yellow">What now? Are you going somewhere next year?</font>

552
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,120
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

553
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:54,400
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, do people want to remember even the pain and sadness?</font>

554
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

555
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,200
<font color="yellow">What kind of love would it be to want to remember it</font>

556
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,880
<font color="yellow">despite being so painful that makes you unable to eat or sleep?</font>

557
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,760
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

558
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,800
<font color="yellow">- What are you thinking about right now? - What?</font>

559
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,920
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

560
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,280
<font color="yellow">Would you like to see first snow?</font>

561
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,120
<font color="yellow">Though the first snow in Seoul is over, there are places that still hasn't snowed.</font>

562
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,840
<font color="yellow">There is?</font>

563
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,800
<font color="yellow">What then, would you like to try going?</font>

564
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, I want to try.</font>

565
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,640
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

566
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,960
<font color="yellow">I can obtain a medical record here, correct?</font>

567
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, and you'd have brought the consent form or the power of attorney?</font>

568
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,680
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. Here it is.</font>

569
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,040
<font color="yellow">- The x-ray would be included as well, right? - Yes.</font>

570
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,520
<font color="yellow">CEO, I've met with Joon Jae.</font>

571
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,200
<font color="yellow">You met him?</font>

572
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,840
<font color="yellow">Yes sir.</font>

573
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,760
<font color="yellow">I've passed onto him that you've been wanting to meet him.</font>

574
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,880
<font color="yellow">But it seems he still needs some time.</font>

575
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,760
<font color="yellow">I'll try to persuade him when I see him again.</font>

576
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,280
<font color="yellow">Chief Nam.</font>

577
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir?</font>

578
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,000
<font color="yellow">I'm always grateful for you.</font>

579
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,640
<font color="yellow">It's nothing sir.</font>

580
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,160
<font color="yellow">Please let me see him, no matter what it takes. I have a lot of things I want to tell him.</font>

581
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,840
<font color="yellow">Yes sir, I understand.</font>

582
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,800
<font color="yellow">Have you received a call from the CEO?</font>

583
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, just now.</font>

584
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,480
<font color="yellow">Who-!</font>

585
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,920
<font color="yellow">Dramalove.TV</font>

586
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,040
<font color="yellow">This much snow fell since the first snow?!</font>

587
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,120
<font color="yellow">That's right. Me, I went through so much trouble trying to find where it snows most, just for you.</font>

588
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

589
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,040
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

590
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,360
<font color="yellow">-  When I made you wait  -</font>

591
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:42,080
<font color="yellow">-  Whenever you smile, I'm always sorry  -</font>

592
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,040
<font color="yellow">- Precious things  -</font>

593
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,240
<font color="yellow">- Always make me scared  -</font>

594
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,680
<font color="yellow">- I'm always so nervous, so worried about you  -</font>

595
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,480
<font color="yellow">- It's the first time I've ever felt this way  -</font>

596
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:10,160
<font color="yellow">- Wherever it is, whenever the time is when I meet you  -</font>

597
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,640
<font color="yellow">- And tell you I love you, as if I say it all the time  -</font>

598
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,200
<font color="yellow">Let's put these on. You have to put stuff like this on when you're here.  - Whenever I see you  -</font>

599
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,480
<font color="yellow">- Somewhere inside me keeps hurting  -</font>

600
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,280
<font color="yellow">- Wherever it is, whenever the time  -</font>

601
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,400
<font color="yellow">But, I feel like I've seen this somewhere...  - I'm afraid that we'll have to go far away from each other  -</font>

602
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,800
<font color="yellow">- And forget  -</font>

603
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,840
<font color="yellow">Is it dÃÂ©jÃ&nbsp; vu?</font>

604
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:48,680
<font color="yellow">- Even when I'm holding your hand  -</font>

605
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,040
<font color="yellow">Now, watch close. When you're going down, if you make an 11 with your feet, then you'll slide right down.</font>

606
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,160
<font color="yellow">Like this, see?</font>

607
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,480
<font color="yellow">And to stop-</font>

608
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,040
<font color="yellow">How do I stop?!</font>

609
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,080
<font color="yellow">Hey! Make an A! An A!</font>

610
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,200
<font color="yellow">What's an A?! I don't know what an A is!</font>

611
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,440
<font color="yellow">That idiot!</font>

612
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,400
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae!</font>

613
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,480
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae! Move, move!</font>

614
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,400
<font color="yellow">You...Do you know or do you not know, that I just saved your life.</font>

615
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

616
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,960
<font color="yellow">You...Just do one thing I ask you to do.</font>

617
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,640
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

618
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,360
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

619
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,280
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to confirm something...</font>

620
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,880
<font color="yellow">Mhm.</font>

621
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,000
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

622
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,320
<font color="yellow">Can you try saying this?</font>

623
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,320
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

624
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,480
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

625
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,240
<font color="yellow">- This is a love story  -</font>

626
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,920
<font color="yellow">-  Something you can't hide  -</font>

627
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,760
<font color="yellow">- These two eyes that only see you  -</font>

628
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,640
<font color="yellow">- It's me that can't close them  -</font>

629
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,320
<font color="yellow">- This is amazing  -</font>

630
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,920
<font color="yellow">- Even if the entire world  -</font>

631
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,640
<font color="yellow">- is what they offer me  -</font>

632
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:35,720
<font color="yellow">- I would be able to trade it with you, my love  -</font>

633
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,000
<font color="yellow">- Some time, just once  -</font>

634
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,080
<font color="yellow">- I knew he would come  -</font>

635
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,440
<font color="yellow">- That person, that love   -</font>

636
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,520
<font color="yellow">- I will find him, I said  -</font>

637
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,040
<font color="yellow">Epiloge So family is like red-bean fish-pastry.</font>

638
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,040
<font color="yellow">They all look alike, and they're warm.</font>

639
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,080
<font color="yellow">And they're sweet.</font>

640
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,440
<font color="yellow">Well, it's not always nice. They're both the illness and the cure.</font>

641
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,800
<font color="yellow">Even with me, I was going through all sorts of things trying to help my son pay off his debt.</font>

642
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,600
<font color="yellow">That's when the disc in my back ruptured.</font>

643
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,560
<font color="yellow">- I'm so afraid this might all be a dream, I can't open my eyes  -</font>

644
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,200
<font color="yellow">- This is my love story  -</font>

645
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,600
<font color="yellow">- I love only you  -</font>

646
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,800
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better? I was so shocked back then too.</font>

647
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,840
<font color="yellow">It was the first time I'd ever caused an accident and the victim...</font>

648
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,200
<font color="yellow">The victim is someone that happens to know my little brother.</font>

649
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,400
<font color="yellow">Little brother?</font>

650
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Joon Jae's family.</font>

651
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,640
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae's family?</font>

652
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,720
<font color="yellow">Yes! Family.</font>

653
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,600
<font color="yellow">Oh and this, this is mine.</font>

654
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,680
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, I'm so sorry for everything.</font>

655
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
<font color="yellow">And this.</font>

656
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,120
<font color="yellow">You've got fast hands.</font>

657
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:43,720
<font color="yellow">The medical bills will probably be taken care of by insurance but you can just consider that as a form of compensation.</font>

658
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,440
<font color="yellow">W-Why are you looking at me like that? Is there something on my face?</font>

659
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,800
<font color="yellow">I don't like getting hit with water. I know I've taken the envelope of money</font>

660
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,480
<font color="yellow">- but I won't break up with Heo Joon Jae. - Excuse me?</font>

661
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,600
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae family! I love Heo Joon Jae.</font>

662
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,520
<font color="yellow">Just know that.</font>

663
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,360
<font color="yellow">Y-Yes, of course.</font>

664
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,320
<font color="yellow">W-Wait.</font>
