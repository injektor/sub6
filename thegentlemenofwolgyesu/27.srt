00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,870
<font color="yellow">There were times when I had feelings for someone,</font>

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,600
<font color="yellow">but you were the first person...</font>

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,740
<font color="yellow">I ever confessed my feelings to.</font>

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,400
<font color="yellow">My life has been a one-way road so far.</font>

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,040
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm lying?</font>

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,270
<font color="yellow">No. It's not that.</font>

10
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,670
<font color="yellow">The truth is, it was my first time, too.</font>

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,870
<font color="yellow">It was my first time hearing a proper love confession.</font>

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,540
<font color="yellow">It's settled, then.</font>

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,070
<font color="yellow">We're clumsy because we're both new at this.</font>

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,540
<font color="yellow">So let's understand each other, okay?</font>

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,500
<font color="yellow">Is it okay for someone like me, who has so many flaws...</font>

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,270
<font color="yellow">to like someone like him?</font>

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
<font color="yellow">What if I'm too greedy and it doesn't work out in the end?</font>

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,300
<font color="yellow">I often think about it,</font>

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,770
<font color="yellow">but whenever I see his face,</font>

20
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,200
<font color="yellow">my heart pounds and I feel butterflies.</font>

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,600
<font color="yellow">And I don't mind about it at all.</font>

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,870
<font color="yellow">Is it really okay for me to like Mr Lee?</font>

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,740
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil has an innocence...</font>

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,970
<font color="yellow">that I lost long ago.</font>

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,300
<font color="yellow">Seeing you, Yun Shil...</font>

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,570
<font color="yellow">is now a source of pleasure and happiness.</font>

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,470
<font color="yellow">I want to provide you with shoulders you can lean on...</font>

28
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,670
<font color="yellow">and a warm heart to envelop you.</font>

29

<font color="yellow">Don't think of anything else but your happiness, Yun Shil.</font>

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,400
<font color="yellow">I will be with you forever.</font>

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,840
<font color="yellow">It's so cold outside.</font>

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,470
<font color="yellow">I think it snowed last night.</font>

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,140
<font color="yellow">Just a bit. It's all melted now.</font>

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,370
<font color="yellow">You're helpless.</font>

35
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,770
<font color="yellow">Did you dance enough to hurt your knees?</font>

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,600
<font color="yellow">I'm old. My joints aren't the same.</font>

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,540
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that I'm sticking...</font>

<font color="yellow">pain relief patches on my dancer wife.</font>

39
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,370
<font color="yellow">We lost all the money we got from selling the store.</font>

40
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,940
<font color="yellow">What should we live off now?</font>

41
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,040
<font color="yellow">I wish we got a windfall.</font>

42
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,940
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. It's all my fault. - I'm glad you know.</font>

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,370
<font color="yellow">How about...</font>

44
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,300
<font color="yellow">I do the housework while you rest?</font>

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,870
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Cook breakfast?</font>

46
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,300
<font color="yellow">No. Do the laundry. There's a whole load waiting.</font>

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

48
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,000
<font color="yellow">He has a conscience, though.</font>

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,870
<font color="yellow">He offered to do the housework for once.</font>

50
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,970
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

51
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,370
<font color="yellow">A lottery ticket?</font>

52
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,440
<font color="yellow">Did you buy a lottery ticket?</font>

53
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,140
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,770
<font color="yellow">I forgot about that.</font>

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,340
<font color="yellow">Check the numbers. Maybe we got lucky.</font>

56
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,840
<font color="yellow">Dream on, lady.</font>

57
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
<font color="yellow">Let's see. Which week was this for?</font>

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
<font color="yellow">- Okay, 6, 7. - 6, 7.</font>

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
<font color="yellow">- 18. - 18.</font>

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,170
<font color="yellow">- 23. - 23. My goodness.</font>

61
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,840
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - What is it? Was it correct?</font>

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,200
<font color="yellow">I think we might win the first place.</font>

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,070
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

64
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not, see for yourself.</font>

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,740
<font color="yellow">We got 6, 7, 18, 23?</font>

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,770
<font color="yellow">What's the next number?</font>

67
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,040
<font color="yellow">Let's see. It's 32.</font>

68
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,670
<font color="yellow">- 32? - Is it 32?</font>

69
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,170
<font color="yellow">- It's 32. - Did we actually win?</font>

70
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,170
<font color="yellow">- What will you do if we win? - Me? I don't know.</font>

71
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,300
<font color="yellow">I should pay off my debt first.</font>

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,070
<font color="yellow">I will... I'll buy a house first.</font>

73
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,700
<font color="yellow">With a huge garden.</font>

74
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,740
<font color="yellow">I'll plant trees and flowers, and get a dog.</font>

75
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

76
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,570
<font color="yellow">- Read the next number. - What?</font>

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,770
<font color="yellow">Hang on. I'm so nervous I can't see properly.</font>

78
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,270
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

79
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,240
<font color="yellow">It's 40.</font>

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,470
<font color="yellow">- 40? - 40.</font>

81
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,170
<font color="yellow">Did we win third place?</font>

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,270
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

83
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,600
<font color="yellow">Wait, there's a bonus number.</font>

84
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,970
<font color="yellow">The bonus number's...</font>

85
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,040
<font color="yellow">41.</font>

86
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,170
<font color="yellow">Okay, 41.</font>

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,870
<font color="yellow">- We won! - We won?</font>

88
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,570
<font color="yellow">We won. We won!</font>

89
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,140
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,640
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - We really got it!</font>

91
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,510
<font color="yellow">What's this noise?</font>

92
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,970
<font color="yellow">Come over here.</font>

93
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,510
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

94
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,070
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo won the lottery. Second place.</font>

95
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,870
<font color="yellow">- Second place? - The pig dream I had...</font>

96
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,140
<font color="yellow">was about this, not a baby.</font>

97
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,800
<font color="yellow">How much does the second-place winner get?</font>

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,140
<font color="yellow">Even after all the tax,</font>

99
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,270
<font color="yellow">it's about 20,000 dollars.</font>

100
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,970
<font color="yellow">Am I dreaming? Pinch me so I can check.</font>

101
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,040
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

102
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,140
<font color="yellow">I guess there's always a way out.</font>

103
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,440
<font color="yellow">I was so upset about the debt you got us into.</font>

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,970
<font color="yellow">We got a windfall after all.</font>

105
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,870
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this happened to someone I know.</font>

106
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,100
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,670
<font color="yellow">I bought a lottery ticket, too...</font>

108
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,040
<font color="yellow">and I can't find it anywhere. I should look for it.</font>

109
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,470
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

110
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

111
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,400
<font color="yellow">This is my ticket.</font>

112
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,470
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Why is this yours?</font>

113
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,670
<font color="yellow">I wrote the word "peace" on the back of the ticket.</font>

114
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,070
<font color="yellow">You're mistaken. I wrote that.</font>

115
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,540
<font color="yellow">You wrote the word "peace"?</font>

116
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,170
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Why?</font>

117
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,540
<font color="yellow">Because I wanted to.</font>

118
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,170
<font color="yellow">Honey, he's wrong, isn't he?</font>

119
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,870
<font color="yellow">You bought this, right?</font>

120
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,070
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

121
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,800
<font color="yellow">That is my handwriting.</font>

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
<font color="yellow">This is just insane.</font>

123
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,340
<font color="yellow">Call out the numbers, then.</font>

124
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,770
<font color="yellow">The numbers? Sure.</font>

125
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,940
<font color="yellow">They're 6, 7, 18, 23, 32, 41.</font>

126
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,140
<font color="yellow">- Correct. - That's because...</font>

127
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,640
<font color="yellow">6 and 7 are the date of my debut, June 7.</font>

128
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,740
<font color="yellow">18 is for January 8, the birthday of my late dad.</font>

129
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,200
<font color="yellow">23 is for February 3, the birthday of my late mum.</font>

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
<font color="yellow">32 is the number of my house in New York.</font>

131
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,500
<font color="yellow">And finally...</font>

132
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,000
<font color="yellow">42 is my age. Okay?</font>

133
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,800
<font color="yellow">It makes sense.</font>

134
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,340
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

135
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,000
<font color="yellow">That ticket is mine.</font>

136
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,570
<font color="yellow">I know money changes people,</font>

137
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,940
<font color="yellow">but this is wrong.</font>

138
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,500
<font color="yellow">Why is it wrong?</font>

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,140
<font color="yellow">That ticket is mine.</font>

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,640
<font color="yellow">Time out, people.</font>

141
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,000
<font color="yellow">Let's have a test.</font>

142
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
<font color="yellow">- A test? - A test?</font>

143
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
<font color="yellow">Listen up.</font>

144
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,940
<font color="yellow">The person who can write the word written on the back...</font>

145
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,870
<font color="yellow">is the owner of the ticket, okay?</font>

146
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,270
<font color="yellow">Begin.</font>

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,870
<font color="yellow">Oh, silly me.</font>

148
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,100
<font color="yellow">What did I write on the back?</font>

149
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,100
<font color="yellow">"Peace", in English.</font>

150
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,070
<font color="yellow">That's it. I wrote "peace".</font>

151
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

152
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
<font color="yellow">This stands for "personal computer".</font>

153
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,940
<font color="yellow">It's "peace".</font>

154
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,340
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

155
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,470
<font color="yellow">I got a bit distracted.</font>

156
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,170
<font color="yellow">P...</font>

157
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
<font color="yellow">S?</font>

158
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,770
<font color="yellow">IS?</font>

159
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,840
<font color="yellow">I think this is yours, Tae Pyung.</font>

160
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,440
<font color="yellow">Where did you find this?</font>

161
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,570
<font color="yellow">I found it on the ground while I was...</font>

162
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,740
<font color="yellow">doing community service, so I picked it up.</font>

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't throw it away. I dropped it.</font>

164
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,240
<font color="yellow">Whether you threw it away or dropped it...</font>

165
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,900
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

166
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,300
<font color="yellow">finders are keepers.</font>

167
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,370
<font color="yellow">- Come back. - Sun Nyeo.</font>

168
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,970
<font color="yellow">You really can't do this.</font>

169
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,370
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Don't do this!</font>

170
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,640
<font color="yellow">- Sun Nyeo! - I just can't believe this.</font>

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,770
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo!</font>

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,770
<font color="yellow">You're up early, Sir.</font>

173
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,470
<font color="yellow">Come back, Sun Nyeo.</font>

174
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,610
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Sir.</font>

175
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,070
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo!</font>

176
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,900
<font color="yellow">I'll sweep the yard later. Leave it.</font>

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
<font color="yellow">What's all the fuss about?</font>

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,340
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

179
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,040
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

180
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,440
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

181
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,140
<font color="yellow">Where did this woman get to?</font>

182
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

183
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,240
<font color="yellow">She just disappeared.</font>

184
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,440
<font color="yellow">She's really fast.</font>

185
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,470
<font color="yellow">Banks close on weekends...</font>

186
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,340
<font color="yellow">so she can't claim the money.</font>

187
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,140
<font color="yellow">I'll make her...</font>

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,500
<font color="yellow">return the ticket.</font>

189
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
<font color="yellow">I know you're in a tough spot,</font>

190
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,340
<font color="yellow">but I bought that ticket as a last resort.</font>

191
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,000
<font color="yellow">- It's my final ray of hope. - I know.</font>

192
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,840
<font color="yellow">Whatever people say, it's yours.</font>

193
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,240
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry. - Thanks.</font>

194
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,940
<font color="yellow">She'll be back soon. Let's wait inside.</font>

195
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

196
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,570
<font color="yellow">My feet are freezing.</font>

197
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,400
<font color="yellow">You're wrong.</font>

198
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,170
<font color="yellow">It belongs to whoever has it.</font>

199
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,540
<font color="yellow">Where should I hide it?</font>

200
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,640
<font color="yellow">Sam Do will find it if he strip-searches me.</font>

201
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,500
<font color="yellow">Should I bury it under a tree?</font>

202
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,140
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

203
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,800
<font color="yellow">Is Yun Shil still asleep?</font>

204
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,540
<font color="yellow">I guess she was tired.</font>

205
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,640
<font color="yellow">I checked on her and she was fast asleep.</font>

206
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,540
<font color="yellow">Should I have woken her for breakfast?</font>

207
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,240
<font color="yellow">Sleep is the best medicine when you are tired.</font>

208
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,200
<font color="yellow">It's her day off. Let her sleep in.</font>

209
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,100
<font color="yellow">Will you stay at home, Uncle?</font>

210
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,000
<font color="yellow">Yes. I have a book to read.</font>

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,670
<font color="yellow">- See you later, then. - Have a nice day.</font>

212
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,100
<font color="yellow">There is food on the table...</font>

213
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,840
<font color="yellow">for when Yun Shil wakes up.</font>

214
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,100
<font color="yellow">Tell her to heat the soup and have some rice.</font>

215
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,170
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

216
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,370
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Bye, Uncle.</font>

217
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,440
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Bye.</font>

218
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,470
<font color="yellow">- Take care. - Bye.</font>

219
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,700
<font color="yellow">Is she catching up on a week's worth of sleep?</font>

220
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,840
<font color="yellow">It's nearly 11am.</font>

221
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,540
<font color="yellow">She's still fast asleep.</font>

222
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,170
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,470
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

224
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,200
<font color="yellow">What time is it?</font>

225
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,800
<font color="yellow">Is everyone out?</font>

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,370
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi. Dong Sook.</font>

227
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,600
<font color="yellow">- Are you up? - Sorry.</font>

228
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,240
<font color="yellow">I don't usually wake up this late,</font>

229
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,500
<font color="yellow">but I slept late last night.</font>

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,940
<font color="yellow">Did everyone go out?</font>

231
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,040
<font color="yellow">My parents went to a wedding...</font>

232
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,640
<font color="yellow">and Dong Sook and Da Jeong went to work.</font>

233
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,940
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

234
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,770
<font color="yellow">Go and freshen up. I'm setting the table.</font>

235
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,570
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

236
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,800
<font color="yellow">I'll eat something at home.</font>

237
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,400
<font color="yellow">I waited for you to get up.</font>

238
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,540
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to.</font>

239
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,040
<font color="yellow">Wash your face first.</font>

240
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,100
<font color="yellow">There's sleep in both your eyes.</font>

241
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,200
<font color="yellow">That was lame.</font>

242
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
<font color="yellow">The yolk broke.</font>

243
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,140
<font color="yellow">Too bad.</font>

244
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,900
<font color="yellow">Let's succeed this time.</font>

245
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,840
<font color="yellow">Not again.</font>

246
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,100
<font color="yellow">Frying eggs is harder than I thought.</font>

247
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,900
<font color="yellow">It's so difficult.</font>

248
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,870
<font color="yellow">Let's do this.</font>

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,470
<font color="yellow">And then...</font>

250
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,600
<font color="yellow">Did I do it this time?</font>

251
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,370
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

252
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,670
<font color="yellow">It's a success.</font>

253
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,870
<font color="yellow">This is a perfect fried egg.</font>

254
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,870
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

255
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,570
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

256
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,800
<font color="yellow">Did you cook all this?</font>

257
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,070
<font color="yellow">My mother set out the table.</font>

258
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,800
<font color="yellow">I fried this egg, though.</font>

259
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,100
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

260
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,370
<font color="yellow">Isn't it the perfect shape?</font>

261
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,200
<font color="yellow">It's hard to fry both sides without bursting the yolk.</font>

262
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,940
<font color="yellow">You must be a good cook.</font>

263
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,640
<font color="yellow">If you want to taste...</font>

264
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,540
<font color="yellow">a perfectly shaped fried egg,</font>

265
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,670
<font color="yellow">just say you'll marry me.</font>

266
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,040
<font color="yellow">I'll make them for free every day.</font>

267
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,270
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to put pressure on you.</font>

268
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,640
<font color="yellow">- Eat before the soup gets cold. - Okay.</font>

269
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,670
<font color="yellow">Eat the fried egg.</font>

270
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,170
<font color="yellow">- It's fine. You eat it. - I had two already.</font>

271
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,000
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

272
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,470
<font color="yellow">I ate the two fried eggs that I'd ruined.</font>

273
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,970
<font color="yellow">I only bared succeeded on cooking this.</font>

274
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,640
<font color="yellow">Why did you try so hard?</font>

275
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,970
<font color="yellow">I will eat anything.</font>

276
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,970
<font color="yellow">I don't like it...</font>

277
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,440
<font color="yellow">when you say things like "anything"...</font>

278
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,670
<font color="yellow">or "something".</font>

279
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,000
<font color="yellow">I want you to be treasured,</font>

280
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,170
<font color="yellow">looked after and treated with respect.</font>

281
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,600
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

282
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,240
<font color="yellow">That's where I'll start.</font>

283
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,840
<font color="yellow">I never thought that...</font>

284
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,670
<font color="yellow">I was a person worth treasuring.</font>

285
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,540
<font color="yellow">You're the first to tell me that.</font>

286
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,500
<font color="yellow">So you don't like it?</font>

287
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,740
<font color="yellow">Good. Eat up.</font>

288
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,570
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

289
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,240
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

290
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,370
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

291
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,940
<font color="yellow">I need to take some deep breaths.</font>

292
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,600
<font color="yellow">My mum and sister aren't too tough to deal with.</font>

293
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,310
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry. - Okay.</font>

294
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,970
<font color="yellow">Give me two minutes.</font>

295
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,540
<font color="yellow">You tortured me half to death...</font>

296
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,940
<font color="yellow">and you seem so relaxed.</font>

297
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,840
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

298
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,070
<font color="yellow">- What is it now? - "What is it now?"</font>

299
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,470
<font color="yellow">I know that love blinds you,</font>

300
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,540
<font color="yellow">but how dare you run off at night.</font>

301
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,170
<font color="yellow">Don't you care about your family? Is Tae Yang all you care about?</font>

302
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,240
<font color="yellow">You and Hyo Sang will do fine without me,</font>

303
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,540
<font color="yellow">but my Tae Yang knows no one else in Seoul.</font>

304
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,240
<font color="yellow">"My Tae Yang"?</font>

305
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,340
<font color="yellow">I should shave your head and kick you out.</font>

306
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,100
<font color="yellow">What should I do with you?</font>

307
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,040
<font color="yellow">- Kick me out. - What?</font>

308
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,370
<font color="yellow">I paid three months' rent in advance so I have a place to stay.</font>

309
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,570
<font color="yellow">I have a regular restaurant nearby, too.</font>

310
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,400
<font color="yellow">I have no worries.</font>

311
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,040
<font color="yellow">Why you little...</font>

312
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,810
<font color="yellow">You're too stupid to be my daughter.</font>

313
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,940
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I carried you for 10 months.</font>

314
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,640
<font color="yellow">- Are you going somewhere? - No.</font>

315
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,470
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed up...</font>

316
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,600
<font color="yellow">like someone going to a party?</font>

317
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,240
<font color="yellow">Your son and his girlfriend just arrived.</font>

318
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

319
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,400
<font color="yellow">You dressed up to meet Hyo Sang's girlfriend.</font>

320
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,500
<font color="yellow">Will you let them get married?</font>

321
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,040
<font color="yellow">No way. I'll tear them apart.</font>

322
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,170
<font color="yellow">Be nice.</font>

323
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,740
<font color="yellow">He likes her. Case closed.</font>

324
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,070
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

325
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,070
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's that simple?</font>

326
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,440
<font color="yellow">Get changed and come downstairs.</font>

327
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,440
<font color="yellow">Why should I get changed?</font>

328
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,170
<font color="yellow">We need to crush her on the first day.</font>

329
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,400
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her now?</font>

330
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,040
<font color="yellow">- Wear this. - You're so childish.</font>

331
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,700
<font color="yellow">Okay. Fine.</font>

332
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,640
<font color="yellow">You can relax. It's just a meal.</font>

333
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,500
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

334
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,810
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

335
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,570
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

336
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,270
<font color="yellow">I see that. Welcome.</font>

337
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,370
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

338
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,540
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Choi Ji Yun.</font>

339
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,900
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem.</font>

340
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,070
<font color="yellow">I put my hair up often. What if I ended up with a scar?</font>

341
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,040
<font color="yellow">You have quite a temper for someone your age.</font>

342
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,570
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about me?</font>

343
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,310
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

344
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,640
<font color="yellow">What a small world.</font>

345
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,400
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

346
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,600
<font color="yellow">I had an important taping that day and I was nervous.</font>

347
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,870
<font color="yellow">It's understandable.</font>

348
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,170
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - You don't need to know, son.</font>

349
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,310
<font color="yellow">It's a female topic.</font>

350
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,440
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

352
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
<font color="yellow">It doesn't smell nice.</font>

353
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,940
<font color="yellow">My younger sister, Min Hyo Won.</font>

354
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,540
<font color="yellow">Wait, your girlfriend's that evil witch?</font>

355
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,740
<font color="yellow">I mean, is that her?</font>

356
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,340
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

357
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,970
<font color="yellow">- What was that for? - What do you mean?</font>

358
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,070
<font color="yellow">You tripped me up for no reason.</font>

359
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,040
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you apologise?</font>

360
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't trip you up.</font>

361
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
<font color="yellow">You didn't look where you were going.</font>

362
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,570
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

363
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,040
<font color="yellow">What? What are you doing?</font>

364
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,600
<font color="yellow">Don't tick off someone who's trying to be calm, okay?</font>

365
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,640
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

366
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,970
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of me.</font>

367
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,940
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

368
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,570
<font color="yellow">I'm pleased to see you.</font>

369
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,700
<font color="yellow">Are you pleased?</font>

370
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,040
<font color="yellow">I really don't think you should be.</font>

371
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,240
<font color="yellow">Do you know each other?</font>

372
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,070
<font color="yellow">I'll explain later.</font>

373
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,570
<font color="yellow">Let's eat first.</font>

374
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,100
<font color="yellow">There's no way you're marrying my brother.</font>

375
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

376
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,000
<font color="yellow">She can't eat if you two keep staring at her.</font>

377
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,500
<font color="yellow">Don't mind us. Eat in peace.</font>

378
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,600
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

379
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you two so dressed up?</font>

380
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,040
<font color="yellow">- We aren't. - We aren't.</font>

381
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,870
<font color="yellow">You're both dressed like you're going to a ball.</font>

382
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,300
<font color="yellow">I'm here for the job interview.</font>

383
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,470
<font color="yellow">Just a moment. I'll tell the manager.</font>

384
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,770
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

385
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,770
<font color="yellow">Have you worked in a restaurant before?</font>

386
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,340
<font color="yellow">Not at a hamburger joint, but I did serve pizzas once.</font>

387
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,040
<font color="yellow">Can I use the bathroom?</font>

388
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,900
<font color="yellow">Of course you can.</font>

389
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,800
<font color="yellow">Use the one upstairs.</font>

390
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

391
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

392
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,970
<font color="yellow">To get my phone from my room.</font>

393
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,340
<font color="yellow">I won't be long.</font>

394
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,470
<font color="yellow">Why are they his mother and sister?</font>

395
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,400
<font color="yellow">Nothing's working out.</font>

396
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,770
<font color="yellow">I feel sick.</font>

397
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,540
<font color="yellow">Why can't I open the door?</font>

398
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,500
<font color="yellow">Can you open the door for me?</font>

399
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,940
<font color="yellow">I didn't bring my phone.</font>

400
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,970
<font color="yellow">Let me out.</font>

401
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,540
<font color="yellow">- Is anyone there? - You need a lesson.</font>

402
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,470
<font color="yellow">How do you know Ji Yun?</font>

403
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,270
<font color="yellow">I met her at the salon a few times, then at a bar.</font>

404
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you sulking?</font>

405
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,900
<font color="yellow">Don't you like her?</font>

406
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,170
<font color="yellow">- Of course not. - Of course not.</font>

407
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,540
<font color="yellow">What's taking her so long?</font>

408
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,200
<font color="yellow">Maybe she needed to take a dump.</font>

409
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,170
<font color="yellow">Taking a dump the day she meets us?</font>

410
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,200
<font color="yellow">She's a tough one.</font>

411
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
<font color="yellow">It takes a lot of guts for a woman to take a dump...</font>

412
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,100
<font color="yellow">at her boyfriend's house on her first visit, right, Mum?</font>

413
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,140
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

414
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,700
<font color="yellow">I'll check on her.</font>

415
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,900
<font color="yellow">You'll only embarrass her.</font>

416
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,170
<font color="yellow">I'll go.</font>

417
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,500
<font color="yellow">Let me out. Is anyone there?</font>

418
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,970
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang.</font>

419
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,540
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

420
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,370
<font color="yellow">Did you do this?</font>

421
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,470
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

422
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

423
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,500
<font color="yellow">I have nothing and I hate it, so I'm all twisted inside.</font>

424
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,970
<font color="yellow">What kind of woman am I?</font>

425
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,900
<font color="yellow">You have nothing and hate it, so you're all twisted inside.</font>

426
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,770
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Yes, you.</font>

427
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,270
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

428
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,440
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

429
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,540
<font color="yellow">Get out here.</font>

430
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,240
<font color="yellow">You witch.</font>

431
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,440
<font color="yellow">I'll let you off today because I'm drunk.</font>

432
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,600
<font color="yellow">You'll pay for this next time.</font>

433
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,540
<font color="yellow">You caught me at a bad time. I was upset over a personal issue.</font>

434
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,570
<font color="yellow">I went too far.</font>

435
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,370
<font color="yellow">I apologise. I'm sorry.</font>

436
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,400
<font color="yellow">How odd. That apology didn't feel sincere at all.</font>

437
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,170
<font color="yellow">Your brother told me a lot about you.</font>

438
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,670
<font color="yellow">I was curious.</font>

439
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,840
<font color="yellow">Can we get over the past...</font>

440
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,070
<font color="yellow">and act like sisters from now on?</font>

441
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
<font color="yellow">We'll see.</font>

442
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,640
<font color="yellow">What a brat.</font>

443
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
<font color="yellow">Choi Ji Yun.</font>

444
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,700
<font color="yellow">There's no way you'll become my sister-in-law.</font>

445
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,870
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be your family.</font>

446
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,900
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

447
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,570
<font color="yellow">your parents died in a car accident when you were young?</font>

448
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,440
<font color="yellow">Yes. My uncle raised me until I finished high school.</font>

449
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,170
<font color="yellow">That must have been tough.</font>

450
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,640
<font color="yellow">I dreamed of getting married...</font>

451
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,640
<font color="yellow">and living with my in-laws as one big happy family.</font>

452
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,440
<font color="yellow">Also, with many children.</font>

453
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,640
<font color="yellow">This is how thoughtful she is.</font>

454
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,270
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

455
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,970
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

456
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,970
<font color="yellow">The upstairs toilet is clogged.</font>

457
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,270
<font color="yellow">Can you do something?</font>

458
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,440
<font color="yellow">It was fine just this morning.</font>

459
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,540
<font color="yellow">I only washed my hands.</font>

460
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,370
<font color="yellow">For that long?</font>

461
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,400
<font color="yellow">You took over 20 minutes.</font>

462
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,600
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

463
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,140
<font color="yellow">- the door got stuck. - It's fine.</font>

464
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,800
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to embarrass you.</font>

465
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,700
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

466
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,270
<font color="yellow">Strange things happen. Such is life.</font>

467
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,700
<font color="yellow">It's seriously clogged.</font>

468
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,240
<font color="yellow">We need to call a plumber, Madam Ko.</font>

469
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,270
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo is home.</font>

470
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
<font color="yellow">My older sister.</font>

471
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,200
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Choi Ji Yun.</font>

472
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,270
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Sang's girlfriend? - Yes.</font>

473
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,100
<font color="yellow">I'm practically a guest here.</font>

474
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,900
<font color="yellow">Don't try to look good for me.</font>

475
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,370
<font color="yellow">Don't get scared.</font>

476
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,700
<font color="yellow">Of all the people here, I think that...</font>

477
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,140
<font color="yellow">you're the normal one.</font>

478
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,970
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

479
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,240
<font color="yellow">That brat.</font>

480
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,000
<font color="yellow">Now that we're divorced,</font>

481
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,900
<font color="yellow">I should forget our wedding anniversary.</font>

482
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,870
<font color="yellow">I don't miss being married.</font>

483
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,200
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Joo.</font>

484
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,340
<font color="yellow">You're so pathetic.</font>

485
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,240
<font color="yellow">Let's see...</font>

486
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,270
<font color="yellow">- Let me do the dishes. - It's fine.</font>

487
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,800
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. You make some coffee instead.</font>

488
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,740
<font color="yellow">Can you really do the dishes?</font>

489
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,100
<font color="yellow">What do you think of me?</font>

490
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,770
<font color="yellow">I fried the perfect egg.</font>

491
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,670
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

492
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,200
<font color="yellow">Was something wrong with lunch?</font>

493
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,270
<font color="yellow">Why did you suddenly feel dizzy?</font>

494
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,340
<font color="yellow">I feel fine now.</font>

495
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,900
<font color="yellow">The spell only lasted a while.</font>

496
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,870
<font color="yellow">Let's see a doctor tomorrow.</font>

497
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,440
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

498
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,970
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine after a nap.</font>

499
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,670
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

500
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,770
<font color="yellow">Let me do the dishes...</font>

501
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,670
<font color="yellow">- while you drink your coffee. - It's fine.</font>

502
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,140
<font color="yellow">I just want one sip.</font>

503
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,100
<font color="yellow">Feed me a sip.</font>

504
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,100
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

505
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,340
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing?</font>

506
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,040
<font color="yellow">You're back early.</font>

507
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,940
<font color="yellow">Your father didn't feel well,</font>

508
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,640
<font color="yellow">so we didn't stay long.</font>

509
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

510
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,800
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil said she couldn't stay for too long,</font>

511
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,700
<font color="yellow">so I was doing the dishes.</font>

512
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,470
<font color="yellow">She offered to do the washing up...</font>

513
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,500
<font color="yellow">but I was bored and wanted a go.</font>

514
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,600
<font color="yellow">You said you had to go.</font>

515
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,070
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

516
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,670
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

517
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ms Choi. I should have helped out.</font>

518
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,570
<font color="yellow">If you have to go, you are okay to leave.</font>

519
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll get going then.</font>

520
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,370
<font color="yellow">Take the gloves off.</font>

521
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,070
<font color="yellow">- I'm almost done. - Take them off.</font>

522
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,740
<font color="yellow">I'll change and do the rest.</font>

523
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

524
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,140
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be the case,</font>

525
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,370
<font color="yellow">but what if someone got the wrong idea...</font>

526
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,040
<font color="yellow">and spread rumours?</font>

527
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,270
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

528
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,000
<font color="yellow">What kind of rumours?</font>

529
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,170
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil's...</font>

530
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,710
<font color="yellow">husband and mother-in-law are the worst kind of people.</font>

531
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,900
<font color="yellow">What if you get into trouble...</font>

532
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,140
<font color="yellow">just for getting involved with them?</font>

533
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,770
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do anything that will give people ideas.</font>

534
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,470
<font color="yellow">Why won't you answer?</font>

535
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,040
<font color="yellow">- I understand. - That goes for her, too.</font>

536
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,740
<font color="yellow">Even though we're close and we treat her like family,</font>

537
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,900
<font color="yellow">how dare she make you do the dishes when she ate?</font>

538
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,000
<font color="yellow">- She went out of line. - Stop it, Mum.</font>

539
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,140
<font color="yellow">I said I'd do the dishes.</font>

540
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,570
<font color="yellow">Watch how you act around her at work.</font>

541
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,000
<font color="yellow">Don't give people a reason to gossip.</font>

542
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,840
<font color="yellow">Did what my mum say upset you?</font>

543
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,470
<font color="yellow">What she said is true, though.</font>

544
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,840
<font color="yellow">She treated me like one of her own.</font>

545
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,870
<font color="yellow">If she finds out that we like each other,</font>

546
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,470
<font color="yellow">she'd feel so betrayed.</font>

547
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,000
<font color="yellow">That was a wake-up call.</font>

548
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,710
<font color="yellow">This is between you and me.</font>

549
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,270
<font color="yellow">Anyone else is of no consequence.</font>

550
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,470
<font color="yellow">No. You mean a lot to me,</font>

551
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,140
<font color="yellow">but so does the rest of your family.</font>

552
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,940
<font color="yellow">I can't lose them all...</font>

553
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,340
<font color="yellow">over you.</font>

554
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,500
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

555
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,170
<font color="yellow">It didn't make sense from the beginning.</font>

556
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,040
<font color="yellow">I had lost my mind for a while.</font>

557
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,540
<font color="yellow">What's wrong is wrong and isn't meant to work out.</font>

558
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,300
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

559
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,400
<font color="yellow">I don't know how someone like you...</font>

560
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,300
<font color="yellow">ended up liking someone like me.</font>

561
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,240
<font color="yellow">You said you liked me...</font>

562
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,400
<font color="yellow">and I felt grateful.</font>

563
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,900
<font color="yellow">I was fascinated, too.</font>

564
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,170
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I think I got a bit too excited.</font>

565
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,210
<font color="yellow">I'm easily swayed.</font>

566
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,900
<font color="yellow">When you said you liked me,</font>

567
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,940
<font color="yellow">I got confused.</font>

568
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,270
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

569
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,300
<font color="yellow">you aren't attracted to me at all?</font>

570
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,670
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

571
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,770
<font color="yellow">That would be a lie.</font>

572
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,670
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

573
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,870
<font color="yellow">I thought about that.</font>

574
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,740
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a rational attraction.</font>

575
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,500
<font color="yellow">You were so good to me,</font>

576
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,300
<font color="yellow">and I felt a debt of gratitude.</font>

577
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,140
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that?</font>

578
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,710
<font color="yellow">I was a bit confused until a while ago,</font>

579
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,640
<font color="yellow">but now everything's clear.</font>

580
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,210
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

581
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,540
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

582
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,300
<font color="yellow">You finally picked up.</font>

583
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,770
<font color="yellow">I got the parts for your broken boiler.</font>

584
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,170
<font color="yellow">Are you at home?</font>

585
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,800
<font color="yellow">I will be back in 10 minutes.</font>

586
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

587
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,740
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

588
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,740
<font color="yellow">The boiler engineer is coming to my place.</font>

589
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,710
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

590
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

591
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,040
<font color="yellow">We haven't even begun...</font>

592
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,340
<font color="yellow">and she's running away already?</font>

593
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,640
<font color="yellow">I replaced the faulty parts and cleaned the burner, too.</font>

594
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

595
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,500
<font color="yellow">Sign this, please.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Repair Form)</font>

597
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,040
<font color="yellow">It says that Lee Dong Jin requested the repair.</font>

598
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,600
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mr Lee is a friend of...</font>

599

<font color="yellow">the CEO of one of our clients.</font>

600
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,140
<font color="yellow">So our CEO ordered that we make you our first priority.</font>

601
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

602
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,270
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, you did the right thing.</font>

603
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,440
<font color="yellow">But why do the tears keep falling?</font>

604
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,240
<font color="yellow">Hi, Tae Yang.</font>

605
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,210
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming back so late?</font>

606
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,540
<font color="yellow">Your future wife came long ago.</font>

607
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,640
<font color="yellow">My future wife?</font>

608
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,870
<font color="yellow">Don't play dumb.</font>

609
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,940
<font color="yellow">How did you hide such a pretty girlfriend all this time?</font>

610
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,600
<font color="yellow">You really should be examined.</font>

611
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,740
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - Go to the dining room.</font>

612
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,570
<font color="yellow">It's totally a feast.</font>

613
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,040
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

614
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,270

616
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

617
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,210
<font color="yellow">She is so sweet.</font>

618
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,270
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

619
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,840
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

620
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,170
<font color="yellow">So good.</font>

621
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,800
<font color="yellow">I hope you like it.</font>

622
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,570
<font color="yellow">It melts in my mouth.</font>

623
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
<font color="yellow">Is this Korean beef?</font>

624
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
<font color="yellow">Of course, it's Korean beef.</font>

625
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,840
<font color="yellow">You're Tae Yang's friends. Of course, I got Korean beef.</font>

626
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,440
<font color="yellow">You are the best wife, you know that?</font>

627
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,670
<font color="yellow">I envy Tae Yang so much.</font>

628
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,270
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the compliment.</font>

629
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,970
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of him.</font>

630
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,870
<font color="yellow">- Don't fight. Get along, okay? - Okay.</font>

631
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,710
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

632
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,270
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

633
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,240
<font color="yellow">I was serving your friends some food.</font>

634
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,140
<font color="yellow">Sit down and eat.</font>

635
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,040
<font color="yellow">So why are you...</font>

636
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,970
<font color="yellow">- Sit down and eat. - Here.</font>

637
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,100
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

638
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,140
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous.</font>

639
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,070
<font color="yellow">What did you do...</font>

640
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,800
<font color="yellow">to deserve such a pretty and kindhearted girlfriend?</font>

641
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,040
<font color="yellow">If I had a girlfriend who took such good care of me,</font>

642
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,940
<font color="yellow">I'd pass the civil service entrance exam in one try.</font>

643
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,000
<font color="yellow">In light of that, let's give Hyo Won an applause.</font>

644
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,710
<font color="yellow">- Applause. - Applause!</font>

645
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,270
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

646
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you for complimenting me.</font>

647
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want some more?</font>

648
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,000
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

649
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,070
<font color="yellow">Look. He held her hand.</font>

650
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,300
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'm so jealous.</font>

651
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,970
<font color="yellow">You can't do this without even asking me.</font>

652
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,970
<font color="yellow">I wanted to surprise you.</font>

653
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,240
<font color="yellow">You're surprised and totally moved, right?</font>

654
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,340
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring that food?</font>

655
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,500
<font color="yellow">It was a bribe for your neighbours to be good to you.</font>

656
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

657
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,770
<font color="yellow">They say I'm the perfect wife.</font>

658
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,840
<font color="yellow">Everyone envies you a lot.</font>

659
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,270
<font color="yellow">Please stop doing this, Ms Min.</font>

660
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,640
<font color="yellow">Don't call me "Ms Min".</font>

661
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,400
<font color="yellow">You promised to call me "Hyo Won".</font>

662
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
<font color="yellow">- When did I... - In exchange for going home,</font>

663
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,340
<font color="yellow">one, you won't ignore my calls.</font>

664
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,040
<font color="yellow">Two. Don't call me "Ms Min".</font>

665
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,270
<font color="yellow">You agreed to call me "Hyo Won".</font>

666
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,470
<font color="yellow">- That was... - You said it...</font>

667
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,770
<font color="yellow">just to get me to go home?</font>

668
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,900
<font color="yellow">Then I'll run away again.</font>

669
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,800
<font color="yellow">Are you threatening me?</font>

670
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,640
<font color="yellow">Fine. I get it, so stop.</font>

671
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
<font color="yellow">Look there.</font>

672
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,140
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

673
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,710
<font color="yellow">Hearing you say my name makes me so happy.</font>

674
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,170
<font color="yellow">What will become of me if you do this?</font>

675
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,940
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

676
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,370
<font color="yellow">Every guy in your building envies you.</font>

677
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,840
<font color="yellow">Where did the food come from?</font>

678
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,100
<font color="yellow">My brother brought his girlfriend home,</font>

679
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,740
<font color="yellow">so we made a lot of food.</font>

680
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,000
<font color="yellow">I brought some to share.</font>

681
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,800
<font color="yellow">Do you know the announcer Choi Ji Yun, too?</font>

682
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,870
<font color="yellow">- What? - My brother's girlfriend...</font>

683
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,970
<font color="yellow">is an announcer at KBC.</font>

684
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,040
<font color="yellow">She's so annoying.</font>

685
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sure my brother hit on her first,</font>

686
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,870
<font color="yellow">but I'm sure she liked him for his money.</font>

687
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,600
<font color="yellow">Women know other women.</font>

688
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,300
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry inside and eat.</font>

689
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,440
<font color="yellow">This is this season's latest.</font>

690
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,500
<font color="yellow">We have a wide range.</font>

691
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,370
<font color="yellow">I like the design. I'll take one of the outfit you're wearing.</font>

692
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,270
<font color="yellow">This? What a great choice.</font>

693
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,670
<font color="yellow">This is the hottest design of this season.</font>

694
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,570
<font color="yellow">Come this way. I'll ring you up.</font>

695
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,870
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook. Dong Sook.</font>

696
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,900
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many customers here today?</font>

697
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,500
<font color="yellow">We're promoting the newest designs.</font>

698
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,800
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

699
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,370
<font color="yellow">I'd like to buy you everything here.</font>

700
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,140
<font color="yellow">but then you'll have nothing to do,</font>

701
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,340
<font color="yellow">so I'll refrain myself.</font>

702
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,300
<font color="yellow">He's so full of it.</font>

703
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,670
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, take a look at this.</font>

704
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,200
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - This? It's a prenup.</font>

705
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,670
<font color="yellow">It's what Hollywood stars sign before they get married.</font>

706
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,100
<font color="yellow">This is that.</font>

707
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving it to me?</font>

708
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,500
<font color="yellow">I thought we should tie all loose ends before the parents meet.</font>

709
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,470
<font color="yellow">Look through it and let me know if you have any edits or additions.</font>

710
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,670
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

715
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,100
<font color="yellow">Park Dae Sub will provide 2,000 dollars a month...</font>

<font color="yellow">That is all.</font>

736
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,240

737
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,840
<font color="yellow">so you don't fight after marriage.</font>

<font color="yellow">She's a pro.</font>

749
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,840

<font color="yellow">Well, if it is for Dong Sook,</font>

751
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,640
<font color="yellow">I should make some changes for her, but what? It's perfect.</font>

752
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,500
<font color="yellow">Anyway. Dong Sook.</font>

753
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,040
<font color="yellow">I'll be back. Okay.</font>

754
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,840
<font color="yellow">Press one to leave a message.</font>

755
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,370
<font color="yellow">Hey you, Bok Sun Nyeo!</font>

756
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,840
<font color="yellow">Don't live like that.</font>

757
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,000
<font color="yellow">I know you like money,</font>

758
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,740
<font color="yellow">but how could you say someone else's lottery ticket was yours?</font>

759
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,340
<font color="yellow">Stop humiliating your husband and come home right now.</font>

760
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,000
<font color="yellow">I'm very angry. That is all.</font>

761
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,640
<font color="yellow">Did you hear from her?</font>

762
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,200
<font color="yellow">She turned off her phone, so I left a voicemail.</font>

763
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,570
<font color="yellow">I need to get at least that money...</font>

764
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,940
<font color="yellow">to stand tall in front of Dong Sook.</font>

765
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,100
<font color="yellow">I know. You should have been more careful.</font>

766
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
<font color="yellow">Why did you drop it in front of Sun Nyeo?</font>

767
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,670
<font color="yellow">That's like dropping a fish in front of a cat.</font>

768
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,670
<font color="yellow">When I think about that, I want to stab my stupid hands and feet.</font>

769
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,240
<font color="yellow">But Sam Do.</font>

770
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,900
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say she's working at a chicken place</font>

771
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,740
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Where is it?</font>

772
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I only know that she's working at a chicken place.</font>

773
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,440
<font color="yellow">It's nicely fried, so please enjoy.</font>

774
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,100
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

775
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

776
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,840
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Why else?</font>

777
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,570
<font color="yellow">Who knew there were so many chicken places here?</font>

778
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,700
<font color="yellow">We went to every chicken place.</font>

779
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,570
<font color="yellow">Stop playing hide-and-seek, and give me my lottery ticket.</font>

780
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,770
<font color="yellow">Why is that yours? It's mine.</font>

781
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,840
<font color="yellow">Stop being unreasonable and give it to him.</font>

782
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,500
<font color="yellow">Then let's split fairly, okay?</font>

783
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,040
<font color="yellow">I bought it with my money. Why should I split it with you?</font>

784
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,070
<font color="yellow">Then I'll give you the money for the ticket. Let's split it.</font>

785
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,070
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me? You're making no sense.</font>

786
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,770
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll give you 10 percent of it. Deal?</font>

787
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,270
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

788
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,400
<font color="yellow">I need to think.</font>

789
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,270
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

790
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,400
<font color="yellow">Where is she going now?</font>

791
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,000
<font color="yellow">- Stop! - No.</font>

792
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,200
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

793
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,740
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

794
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,040
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

795
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,340
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

796
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,040
<font color="yellow">You lied about your knees, right?</font>

797
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,700
<font color="yellow">Why do you run so well, Ma'am?</font>

798
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,140
<font color="yellow">I know. She should be a track star.</font>

799
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,370
<font color="yellow">She's like a squirrel.</font>

800
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,500
<font color="yellow">Hand it over while we're being nice.</font>

801
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:07,870
<font color="yellow">Fine, I will.</font>

802
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,940
<font color="yellow">You are so annoying.</font>

803
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:15,770
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

804
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,870
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

805
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,400
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

806
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,670
<font color="yellow">I've got you.</font>

807
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,500
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go! Let go!</font>

808
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,140
<font color="yellow">Shut it and hand it over.</font>

809
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,570
<font color="yellow">Finders are keepers.</font>

810
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,940
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't picked it up, it would have been thrown out.</font>

811
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,740
<font color="yellow">How does it belong to you?</font>

812
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,500
<font color="yellow">The person who bought the ticket owns it.</font>

813
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,170
<font color="yellow">I can't accept it.</font>

814
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,340
<font color="yellow">Hey. This is embarrassing, so let's take her first.</font>

815
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,340
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - Don't get me started.</font>

816
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,400
<font color="yellow">She had us running all day.</font>

817
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,340
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - I came second in a lottery.</font>

818
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,070
<font color="yellow">- You did? - Yes.</font>

819
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,440
<font color="yellow">But as luck would have it,</font>

820
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,740
<font color="yellow">I dropped that lottery ticket by mistake...</font>

821
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,140
<font color="yellow">and she picked it up.</font>

822
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,100
<font color="yellow">She claims that the finder is the owner...</font>

823
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,870
<font color="yellow">and won't give it back.</font>

824
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,540
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

825
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,870
<font color="yellow">How is it yours?</font>

826
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,440
<font color="yellow">It belongs to the person who bought it.</font>

827
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,300
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

828
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,200
<font color="yellow">Let's not waste our energy...</font>

829
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,840
<font color="yellow">and hand it over. Now.</font>

830
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,340
<font color="yellow">There are morals in gambling.</font>

831
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,100
<font color="yellow">How could you try to claim it all?</font>

832
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,600
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 20 percent of it. Deal?</font>

833
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,300
<font color="yellow">- Deal. - Good.</font>

834
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,500
<font color="yellow">Give me my ticket.</font>

835
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,840
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

836
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,770
<font color="yellow">It's not there.</font>

837
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,140
<font color="yellow">- Where did I put it? - What are you saying?</font>

838
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,800
<font color="yellow">Stop playing around. What do you mean?</font>

839
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I put it here.</font>

840
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,240
<font color="yellow">If you put it there, it should be there.</font>

841
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,640
<font color="yellow">- Look carefully. - It's not here.</font>

842
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,140
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to be tricky?</font>

843
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,740
<font color="yellow">I am not.</font>

844
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,140
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure I put It here. - Let me see.</font>

845
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,840
<font color="yellow">Put your arms up.</font>

846
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,170
<font color="yellow">- She really doesn't have it. - She's not lying.</font>

847
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,440
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

848
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,000
<font color="yellow">- I can't remember where I put it. - Calm down.</font>

849
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:26,570
<font color="yellow">Take your time and think slowly.</font>

850
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,440
<font color="yellow">Did you hide it in your socks like I do with money?</font>

851
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,440
<font color="yellow">It's not there.</font>

852
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,670
<font color="yellow">I've been forgetful lately.</font>

853
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,740
<font color="yellow">Even if you have been...</font>

854
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:49,400
<font color="yellow">I mean, please think about it again.</font>

855
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:52,770
<font color="yellow">- Tree. - What?</font>

856
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,770
<font color="yellow">I must have buried it under the tree.</font>

857
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,100
<font color="yellow">- Tree? - Tree?</font>

858
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,570
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Light.</font>

859
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,240
<font color="yellow">- Here? - There.</font>

860
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,770
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

861
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,240
<font color="yellow">What are we doing in the middle of the night?</font>

862
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,570
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

863
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,470
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness it was the second place. Imagine if it were first.</font>

864
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,170
<font color="yellow">She would have gone to overseas.</font>

865
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,700
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

866
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,800
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Please.</font>

867
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,470
<font color="yellow">My hands hurt so much.</font>

868
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,440
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's here.</font>

869
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,740
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you buried it here?</font>

870
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,170
<font color="yellow">I think so,</font>

871
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,640
<font color="yellow">but I can't remember.</font>

872
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,340
<font color="yellow">You buried it with your own hands. How do you not remember?</font>

873
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

874
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,100
<font color="yellow">I must have been too upset earlier.</font>

875
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,040
<font color="yellow">I just can't remember.</font>

876
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,670
<font color="yellow">- Maybe it's at home. - No.</font>

877
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,170
<font color="yellow">She hasn't been home yet all day.</font>

878
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,740
<font color="yellow">If it isn't under the tree,</font>

879
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,600
<font color="yellow">it means it's on her body.</font>

880
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,670
<font color="yellow">- What... - No</font>

881
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,770
<font color="yellow">We checked every single pocket.</font>

882
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,900
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo.</font>

883
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,340
<font color="yellow">Look into my eyes.</font>

884
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,400
<font color="yellow">Take off your sneakers.</font>

885
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,970
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Go ahead.</font>

886
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,140
<font color="yellow">Did you find it? Did you?</font>

887
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,500
<font color="yellow">(Lottery Ticket)</font>

888
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

889
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,200
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

890
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,370
<font color="yellow">When did I put it there?</font>

891
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,070
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

892
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

893
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,140
<font color="yellow">Did you forget or did you pretend to forget?</font>

894
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,040
<font color="yellow">I really didn't remember.</font>

895
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
<font color="yellow">Where's your head?</font>

896
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,970
<font color="yellow">You said finders must keep it.</font>

897
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,970
<font color="yellow">I found it, so it's mine. Okay?</font>

898
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,300
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

899
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,040
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

900
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

901
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving it to me?</font>

902
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,000
<font color="yellow">I must pay you back first.</font>

903
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,370
<font color="yellow">You can take your time.</font>

904
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:27,370
<font color="yellow">I'll work hard for the rest and pay you.</font>

905
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

906
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,070
<font color="yellow">If I don't win the lottery, why did I see a pig in my dream?</font>

907
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,170
<font color="yellow">It was a meaningless dream.</font>

908
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:40,540
<font color="yellow">So it went in circles and finally went to Dong Sook.</font>

909
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,270
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

910
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,300

912
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,170
<font color="yellow">I'm fine now, but your mum keeps treating me like a patient.</font>

913
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,740
<font color="yellow">You are not fine.</font>

914
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,740
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd faint during the wedding.</font>

915
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,500
<font color="yellow">I was simply light-headed.</font>

916
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,670
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

917
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,400
<font color="yellow">Whatever happens tomorrow,</font>

918
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,540
<font color="yellow">you're going to see the doctor with me.</font>

919
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,970
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

920
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,340
<font color="yellow">I'll take him.</font>

921
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,700
<font color="yellow">- Go with me - Okay.</font>

922
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,740
<font color="yellow">Don't disregard what I said this afternoon.</font>

923
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,440
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mother.</font>

924
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't say for no reason.</font>

925
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,870
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't let other people talk about you.</font>

926
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,540
<font color="yellow">I just told you in advance so that you can be careful.</font>

927
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,400
<font color="yellow">If you want to taste...</font>

928
