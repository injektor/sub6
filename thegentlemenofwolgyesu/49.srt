32
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,019
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

33
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:50,637
<font color="yellow">I asked if you're okay.</font>

34
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:52,807
<font color="yellow">What did the hospital say?</font>

35

<font color="yellow">What's that look in your eyes?</font>

37
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,507
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

38
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,475
<font color="yellow">I'm wondering if this is a dream.</font>

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,475
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should have gotten hurt.</font>

40
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:18,403
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,061

46
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:36,655
<font color="yellow">You're fine, so why did they call<br>like something was really wrong?</font>

47
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,764
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

48
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:44,235
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much,<br>but I don't think it's right.</font>

51
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:52,204
<font color="yellow">You look very pale.</font>

52
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,605
<font color="yellow">You must've been startled.</font>

53
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:59,177
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened, and you're okay.</font>

54
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,407
<font color="yellow">So, let's just go our own way.</font>

55
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:03,037
<font color="yellow">You asked to meet at Namyeong Station.</font>

56
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,076
<font color="yellow">I just saw the text message.</font>

57
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,085
<font color="yellow">You sure read it quickly.</font>

58
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,299
<font color="yellow">You said you remember who I am.</font>

59
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:18,698
<font color="yellow">We did survive death together.</font>

60
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,427
<font color="yellow">Aren't you being too cold to me?</font>

61
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:26,218
<font color="yellow">Yes... I remember it all.</font>

62
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:30,598
<font color="yellow">You're the guy from the subway<br>seven years ago.</font>

63
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:37,057
<font color="yellow">I was surprised and happy to find you.</font>

64
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,290
<font color="yellow">So, I waited all day for you.</font>

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,357
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I was thinking<br>while I waited?</font>

66
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:49,504
<font color="yellow">The man that survived with me...</font>

67
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:52,314
<font color="yellow">I had always been curious to know<br>if he was living well.</font>

68
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:57,836
<font color="yellow">But, you are living so extremely well,<br>so I thought it was a relief.</font>

69
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,686
<font color="yellow">I was so thankful.</font>

70
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:02,314
<font color="yellow">I guess we did end up meeting<br>since we're both alive.</font>

71
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,475
<font color="yellow">Then I suddenly got a call that you<br>were in the emergency room.</font>

72
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,655
<font color="yellow">According to the nurse</font>

73
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:11,554
<font color="yellow">she said you got hurt in the subway<br>tunnel and I thought, "subway again?"</font>

74
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:14,554
<font color="yellow">My insides just dropped.</font>

75
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:17,775
<font color="yellow">What kind of joke is fate playing?</font>

76
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,365
<font color="yellow">I wondered if you were very hurt.</font>

77
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:25,845
<font color="yellow">I had been so relieved to know<br>you were healthy and living well.</font>

78
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:29,703
<font color="yellow">Then we should...</font>

79
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:33,145
<font color="yellow">live together.</font>

80
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:36,335
<font color="yellow">Of course, we should live for like<br>a thousand years. What are you saying?</font>

81
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:39,285
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to live with me?</font>

82
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:41,364
<font color="yellow">I'll live even if you tell me not to.</font>

83
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:44,713
<font color="yellow">You promised.</font>

84
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,454
<font color="yellow">We're going to live together.</font>

85
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,557
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

86
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,206
<font color="yellow">Are you joking around again?</font>

87
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:00,393
<font color="yellow">Yoo So Joon!</font>

88
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,513
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'll get going now.</font>

89
00:07:04,513 --> 00:07:06,295
<font color="yellow">Take a taxi.</font>

90
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,398
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

91
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:10,686
<font color="yellow">You don't have your wallet.<br>Your bag is in my car.</font>

92
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:13,424
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

93
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,083
<font color="yellow">Do you need money for a ride home?<br>Take this.</font>

94
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,400
<font color="yellow">No, I can pay for it with my phone.</font>

95
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,941
<font color="yellow">- Hey...<br>- I'll call you.</font>

96
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,359
<font color="yellow">Yoo So Joon.</font>

97
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,650
<font color="yellow">Thanks for coming.</font>

98
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,059
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?<br>- I'm hurt.</font>

99
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:30,076
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

100
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,783
<font color="yellow">I was in the emergency room.</font>

101
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,415
<font color="yellow">Oh no! Where's your car?</font>

102
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:35,174
<font color="yellow">- I don't have my car.<br>- You don't?</font>

103
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,035
<font color="yellow">Why would I use his money?</font>

104
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:01,204
<font color="yellow">Guys, I'm sorry,<br>but I'm going to head home.</font>

105
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,734
<font color="yellow">Ki Doong, can I borrow your card?</font>

106
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,295
<font color="yellow">Yeah, sure.</font>

107
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:07,516
<font color="yellow">Go home and rest.<br>You're probably not feeling well.</font>

108
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:10,420
<font color="yellow">But, you can't just leave like that.</font>

109
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,873
<font color="yellow">Why were you passed out in the tunnel?<br>Tell me that.</font>

110
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:15,147
<font color="yellow">Come on. I just got out of the hospital.</font>

111
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,361
<font color="yellow">- You look fine.<br>- Ouch! I'm in pain.</font>

112
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,477
<font color="yellow">I'm just so curious.</font>

113
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:23,102
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey. He says he was drunk.</font>

114
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:28,498
<font color="yellow">I was born in the same hospital as you,<br>and I've seen all sides of you.</font>

115
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,899
<font color="yellow">Despite that, there are two things<br>I have not seen.</font>

116
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,035
<font color="yellow">You alone with a girl,<br>and you passed out drunk.</font>

117
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:36,199
<font color="yellow">But I saw both today.</font>

118
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:40,318
<font color="yellow">I date girls all the time,<br>and I've been passed out drunk plenty.</font>

119
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,789
<font color="yellow">You just haven't seen it.</font>

120
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,518
<font color="yellow">I'm not that interested in your life.</font>

121
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:47,410
<font color="yellow">Still, just tell me about the tunnel.<br>I'm so curious, it'll keep me awake.</font>

122
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,050
<font color="yellow">I'm sure So Joon had his reasons.</font>

123
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,012
<font color="yellow">Yes, so what are his reasons<br>for going into a subway tunnel?</font>

124
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:55,512
<font color="yellow">- I'm curious. Aren't you?<br>- No.</font>

125
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:57,618
<font color="yellow">You're weird in my eyes too.</font>

126
00:08:57,618 --> 00:09:00,472
<font color="yellow">Hey, people can go inside subway<br>tunnels once in their lifetime.</font>

127
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:01,859
<font color="yellow">I've done it, haven't you?</font>

128
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:04,478
<font color="yellow">Does that make sense?<br>Does that make sense to you?</font>

129
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,108
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey, Yoo So Joon!</font>

130
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:10,752
<font color="yellow">What have you done all your life?<br>You've never been in a subway tunnel?</font>

131
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:13,527
<font color="yellow">Ask anyone on the street.<br>They've all been in a subway tunnel.</font>

132
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,525
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Come on up.</font>

133
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,825
<font color="yellow">I'm upset today.</font>

134
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,724
<font color="yellow">Why do you two<br>have so many secrets from me?</font>

135
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:25,320
<font color="yellow">What secrets?</font>

136
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:28,583
<font color="yellow">Did you think I've never had suspicions<br>all this time?</font>

137
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,569
<font color="yellow">After So Joon's parents passed away</font>

138
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,850
<font color="yellow">I always thought it was strange<br>how he suddenly became rich.</font>

139
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,281
<font color="yellow">Stocks?</font>

140
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,368
<font color="yellow">Anyone would say that it's strange.</font>

141
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,878
<font color="yellow">You're just as strange for accepting it<br>as if it's normal.</font>

142
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,998
<font color="yellow">You're right. It could appear that way.</font>

143
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,070
<font color="yellow">Don't put on that fake act.</font>

144
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,090
<font color="yellow">So Joon suddenly becomes rich.</font>

145
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,518
<font color="yellow">You drop out of school<br>to work for So Joon.</font>

146
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,709
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm just helping him.</font>

147
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,209
<font color="yellow">To me, it looks like you put<br>your whole life on the line.</font>

148
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,342
<font color="yellow">Even when So Joon was a teenager<br>going through puberty</font>

149
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:07,681
<font color="yellow">he didn't care at all if I went<br>into his room or touched his stuff.</font>

150
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,839
<font color="yellow">Now, he doesn't even let me<br>come near his house.</font>

151
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,470
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me about it.</font>

152
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,054
<font color="yellow">Even if I am living off of So Joon<br>like you say</font>

153
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:20,143
<font color="yellow">I don't need to take care of him<br>outside of the company.</font>

154
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:23,155
<font color="yellow">There is something going on with So Joon<br>and you know that something.</font>

155
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,408
<font color="yellow">There is nothing like that.</font>

156
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:26,677
<font color="yellow">There's nothing?</font>

157
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:27,867
<font color="yellow">There isn't.</font>

158
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,272
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

159
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,786
<font color="yellow">Why do I have his wallet?</font>

160
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,128
<font color="yellow">You promised.</font>

161
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,768
<font color="yellow">We're going to live together.</font>

162
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:06,251
<font color="yellow">He sure has a way of talking.</font>

163
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,190
<font color="yellow">Realtor needs to come with a warning.<br>He's a dangerous guy.</font>

164
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,300
<font color="yellow">I'll return your bag.<br>How is 1:00 p.m?</font>

165
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,576
<font color="yellow">Let's have lunch.</font>

166
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,796
<font color="yellow">That would be rude of me.</font>

167
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,714
<font color="yellow">You didn't by chance open my bag<br>or anything, right?</font>

168
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,624
<font color="yellow">Return my bag to me tomorrow<br>in good condition.</font>

169
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:06,273
<font color="yellow">I'll return your wallet<br>in good condition too.</font>

170
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,550
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Realtor.</font>

171
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:57,008
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Realtor.</font>

172
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,908
<font color="yellow">Song Ma Rin, Chiksa Girls' High School.</font>

173
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,970
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm confident<br>that I can keep you well fed.</font>

174
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,914
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now, Flower.</font>

175
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,921
<font color="yellow">You have to say that.</font>

176
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:24,430
<font color="yellow">Not Bap Soon, but Flower.</font>

177
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,498
<font color="yellow">Do it for me.</font>

178
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:28,570
<font color="yellow">Flower...</font>

179
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,489
<font color="yellow">Flower.</font>

180
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,956
<font color="yellow">Bap Soon. Yes.</font>

181
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:39,896
<font color="yellow">You pass.</font>

182
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,430
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

183
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:54,170
<font color="yellow">Is there a restaurant here?</font>

184
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,579
<font color="yellow">Whose name is the reservation under?</font>

185
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,580
<font color="yellow">Yoo So Joon.</font>

186
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,791
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

187
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,800
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep stealing glances?</font>

188
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,031
<font color="yellow">It's creepy.</font>

189
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,914
<font color="yellow">Why are you smiling?</font>

190
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:36,512
<font color="yellow">I don't like it. Don't smile.</font>

191
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,292
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

192
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:45,785
<font color="yellow">Stop it. What's wrong with you?</font>

193
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:49,544
<font color="yellow">I can't smile, I can't glance.<br>What am I supposed to do?</font>

194
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,863
<font color="yellow">Should I just get lost?</font>

195
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:54,618
<font color="yellow">No. Sorry.</font>

196
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,070
<font color="yellow">What about my bag?</font>

197
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:01,922
<font color="yellow">Is it ready?</font>

198
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,281
<font color="yellow">And my wallet? Is it ready?</font>

199
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,526
<font color="yellow">How are we supposed to eat all of this?</font>

200
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,184
<font color="yellow">I wonder if we can do take-out.</font>

201
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,853
<font color="yellow">You would be good<br>at running a household frugally.</font>

202
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:55,171
<font color="yellow">But if you live with me,<br>you won't need to be frugal.</font>

203
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,482
<font color="yellow">We will be people with a duty to spend.</font>

204
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:02,685
<font color="yellow">Did you say live together?</font>

205
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,113
<font color="yellow">You promised to live with me.</font>

206
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:09,813
<font color="yellow">So, the living together<br>you were referring to</font>

207
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,883
<font color="yellow">it wasn't both of us staying alive?</font>

208
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:17,974
<font color="yellow">It was the living together<br>where you eat and sleep together?</font>

209
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:19,568
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

210
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:23,901
<font color="yellow">We haven't even held hands yet,<br>and you want to move in together?</font>

211
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,888
<font color="yellow">They say pigs are fed a delicious<br>meal before they are slaughtered.</font>

212
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,661
<font color="yellow">Are you feeding me this in order<br>to catch and eat me up?</font>

213
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,879
<font color="yellow">Are you going to pay me, too?</font>

214
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,764
<font color="yellow">I know second-generation rich kids<br>are so spoiled.</font>

215
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:44,553
<font color="yellow">- I saw it on TV and movies...<br>- Hold on.</font>

216
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:47,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not a the second generation<br>of a rich family.</font>

217
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,975
<font color="yellow">- Third generation, then?<br>- Forget all that.</font>

218
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:53,710
<font color="yellow">Is the only way for a man and woman to<br>live in a house just moving in together?</font>

219
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,970
<font color="yellow">Song Ma Rin, are you that one-minded?</font>

220
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,048
<font color="yellow">I'm the type of woman who knows<br>ten things if you teach me one.</font>

221
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,101
<font color="yellow">I can see exactly what you're thinking.</font>

222
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,191
<font color="yellow">Because of our past,<br>I was being thoughtful of you.</font>

223
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:09,997
<font color="yellow">Is this what I get in return?</font>

224
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,844
<font color="yellow">I'm really disappointed in you.</font>

225
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:20,806
<font color="yellow">What kind of person do you take me for?</font>

226
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,181
<font color="yellow">A woman I want to marry.</font>

227
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:24,194
<font color="yellow">What!</font>

228
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:26,350
<font color="yellow">Not to date or just move in with.</font>

229
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,898
<font color="yellow">But a woman I want to marry.</font>

230
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:32,918
<font color="yellow">Marriage?</font>

231
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:37,484
<font color="yellow">Marriage?</font>

232
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,815
<font color="yellow">This isn't the best timing</font>

233
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:43,033
<font color="yellow">but I feel like I'll waste away<br>if I wait any longer.</font>

234
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:47,093
<font color="yellow">How do you feel about marrying me?</font>

235
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,991
<font color="yellow">We could live in one house,<br>intimately and lovey-dovey.</font>

236
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,103
<font color="yellow">Crazy punk.</font>

237
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,892
<font color="yellow">You should stick to asking me<br>to move in with you.</font>

238
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:00,092
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

239
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,795
<font color="yellow">Hey. Song Ma Rin!</font>

240
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:08,856
<font color="yellow">If marriage is too sudden,<br>what do you think about dating?</font>

241
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:10,486
<font color="yellow">Of course, with marriage in mind.</font>

242
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,776
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying?<br>- Wait.</font>

243
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:14,936
<font color="yellow">Don't grab me.</font>

244
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,976
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare touch me.</font>

245
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,866
<font color="yellow">This isn't the way out.<br>It's the restroom.</font>

246
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:24,363
<font color="yellow">That's where I was headed.<br>I need to wash my hands.</font>

247
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:26,199
<font color="yellow">All right, I know. Let's go for now.</font>

248
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,161
<font color="yellow">What do you know about me?</font>

249
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,485
<font color="yellow">What do you really know about me?</font>

250
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:36,547
<font color="yellow">Do you know anything<br>about marriage, or women?</font>

251
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:37,941
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

252
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:42,908
<font color="yellow">I only asked the woman I want to marry<br>to marry me.</font>

253
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:45,388
<font color="yellow">Is getting a proposal from a man<br>something to get so angry about?</font>

254
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:49,590
<font color="yellow">What kind of proposal is so absurd,<br>irrational, threatening?</font>

255
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,429
<font color="yellow">This isn't is a proposal.<br>It's some sort of ploy.</font>

256
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,600
<font color="yellow">I know you may be taken aback.</font>

257
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,938
<font color="yellow">This woman is the one<br>I'm supposed to marry.</font>

258
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,558
<font color="yellow">I must marry this woman.</font>

259
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:00,620
<font color="yellow">I have a clear conviction.</font>

260
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,296
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling.</font>

261
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,092
<font color="yellow">Don't try that with me.</font>

262
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:07,978
<font color="yellow">Where are you even going?</font>

263
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:10,016
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

264
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,996
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do anything to you.<br>Don't get worked up.</font>

265
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:16,865
<font color="yellow">Realtor! You scoundrel.</font>

266
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:19,526
<font color="yellow">This is harassment<br>under the pretext of marriage.</font>

267
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,431
<font color="yellow">You could get in trouble.<br>It's dangerous.</font>

268
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:22,709
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous.</font>

269
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,301
<font color="yellow">Why is this place so complicated?</font>

270
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,711
<font color="yellow">He brought me into the thieves den.</font>

271
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,915
<font color="yellow">I think we were meant to meet,<br>and destined to be together.</font>

272
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,905
<font color="yellow">A shared fate, if you will.</font>

273
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:37,885
<font color="yellow">A shared fate or bad karma.</font>

274
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,286
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago...</font>

275
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:45,180
<font color="yellow">we wouldn't be here in this world<br>if we hadn't met on that subway.</font>

276
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,401
<font color="yellow">You saved me, and I saved you.</font>

277
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:51,459
<font color="yellow">Do you really think our fate<br>is bad karma?</font>

278
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,643
<font color="yellow">I think we are destined for each other.</font>

279
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,325
<font color="yellow">You are just playing me.</font>

280
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:13,075
<font color="yellow">I'm holding onto you like this<br>asking you to have a meal with me.</font>

281
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:16,526
<font color="yellow">Come inside.</font>

282
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:34,364
<font color="yellow">So, you're being sincere with me?</font>

283
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:37,805
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

284
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,093
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

285
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,228
<font color="yellow">Do you love me?</font>

286
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,158
<font color="yellow">I think I will die if I don't marry you.</font>

287
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,969
<font color="yellow">So, give it some serious thought.</font>

288
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:04,466
<font color="yellow">Flower.</font>

289
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,896
<font color="yellow">Not Bap Soon, but Flower.</font>

290
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,845
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

291
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:25,437
<font color="yellow">is like a lump that's been in my heart<br>all my life that is dissolving.</font>

292
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,856
<font color="yellow">Is this ache an effect of that?</font>

293
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,660
<font color="yellow">Are you not feeling well?</font>

294
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:39,676
<font color="yellow">Flower.</font>

295
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,422
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

296
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,335
<font color="yellow">Flower...</font>

297
00:21:57,681 --> 00:21:59,526
<font color="yellow">[Driver]</font>

298
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:03,862
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mister Hwang.<br>I'm a little busy right now.</font>

299
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:16,441
<font color="yellow">Chairman Yoo is with Bap Soon?</font>

300
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:19,344
<font color="yellow">They are coming out together<br>and leaving. Yes.</font>

301
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:23,135
<font color="yellow">They are definitely not in a<br>normal relationship.</font>

302
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,741
<font color="yellow">The chairman has his arms<br>on Bap Soon's shoulder...</font>

303
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:27,900
<font color="yellow">What? What? Her shoulder?</font>

304
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,186
<font color="yellow">What about her shoulder?</font>

305
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:31,808
<font color="yellow">He has it around her shoulder,<br>and is holding her close.</font>

306
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,297
<font color="yellow">Oh, Bap Soon is pushing him away.</font>

307
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:35,960
<font color="yellow">Yes, now he is chasing after her.</font>

308
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, he is.</font>

309
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,892
<font color="yellow">Anyone can see that this is love.</font>

310
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,910
<font color="yellow">It is passionate love.</font>

311
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,171
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Yes, good job.</font>

312
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:44,413
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

313
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:50,201
<font color="yellow">Customer, are you okay?</font>

314
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,603
<font color="yellow">What? Yes.</font>

315
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,356
<font color="yellow">Flower...</font>

316
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,609
<font color="yellow">Flower...</font>

317
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,834
<font color="yellow">Flower?</font>

318
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:21,199
<font color="yellow">Flower...</font>

319
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,708
<font color="yellow">Flower...</font>

320
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,555
<font color="yellow">Hey, Flower.</font>

321
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:27,356
<font color="yellow">No, stop it.</font>

322
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:28,919
<font color="yellow">- Flower.<br>- Stop.</font>

323
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,921
<font color="yellow">So, you can't ignore her?</font>

324
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,432
<font color="yellow">Once she found out we were both<br>survivors of the accident</font>

325
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:38,044
<font color="yellow">do you know what she said to me?</font>

326
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,440
<font color="yellow">She says she's so thankful<br>that I am alive.</font>

327
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,495
<font color="yellow">She's so relieved.</font>

328
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,815
<font color="yellow">How can I ignore a woman like that?</font>

329
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:47,323
<font color="yellow">I know exactly what's going to happen.</font>

330
00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:50,962
<font color="yellow">So, you feel guilty leaving her to die.</font>

331
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,805
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you sure talk in a distasteful way.</font>

332
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:56,193
<font color="yellow">Be honest about it.</font>

333
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:59,634
<font color="yellow">You believed me about telling you<br>to have children.</font>

334
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:03,026
<font color="yellow">Your heart started to beat faster,<br>and you wanted to do it.</font>

335
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,152
<font color="yellow">- You want to marry and have kids.<br>- You're so childish.</font>

336
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,648
<font color="yellow">What's their to hide between us?</font>

337
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:14,775
<font color="yellow">How much do you think I trust you,<br>in percentage?</font>

338
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,255
<font color="yellow">About 120 percent.</font>

339
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:19,815
<font color="yellow">At the most, being optimistic...</font>

340
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,723
<font color="yellow">it's about two percent.</font>

341
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,383
<font color="yellow">What's the reason for the remaining<br>98 percent?</font>

342
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:26,575
<font color="yellow">I told you that I just can't ignore her.</font>

343
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:30,196
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's natural to feel that heat.</font>

344
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:32,756
<font color="yellow">We came to winter because you<br>wanted cold noodles in winter.</font>

345
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:35,045
<font color="yellow">You're making me feel hot.</font>

346
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:38,912
<font color="yellow">Cold noodles are the best in winter.</font>

347
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,698
<font color="yellow">This is something only we know,<br>what else is there to time travel?</font>

348
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:48,029
<font color="yellow">It's about finding the best places to eat<br>and traveling to them.</font>

349
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,228
<font color="yellow">That's the best part.</font>

350
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,422
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

351
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,988
<font color="yellow">- Is it hard to chew?<br>- I just took a big bite.</font>

352
00:24:57,988 --> 00:24:59,248
<font color="yellow">This place is known for their noodles.</font>

353
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:03,003
<font color="yellow">You know if you really get married</font>

354
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,919
<font color="yellow">the future you know<br>will completely change.</font>

355
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,517
<font color="yellow">A woman who wasn't in your fate<br>has suddenly come into your life.</font>

356
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:12,736
<font color="yellow">A reset. You should expect a reset.</font>

357
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:15,554
<font color="yellow">I suppose so.</font>

358
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,555
<font color="yellow">Is that such a big deal?</font>

359
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,498
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

360
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:30,197
<font color="yellow">This is difficult for me to bring up.</font>

361
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:35,978
<font color="yellow">Madam is asking me to do<br>too many personal chores for her.</font>

362
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:37,340
<font color="yellow">- Is that right?<br>- Yes.</font>

363
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,581
<font color="yellow">But, aren't they things you could do?</font>

364
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,190
<font color="yellow">Well, if I could I would like to.</font>

365
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,200
<font color="yellow">I would like to help her out.</font>

366
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,010
<font color="yellow">It's just affecting my work.</font>

367
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,936
<font color="yellow">Is she curious about Bap Soon<br>and Chairman Yoo?</font>

368
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:53,193
<font color="yellow">She wants you to look<br>into their relationship?</font>

369
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:55,013
<font color="yellow">She told me to keep it a secret from you.</font>

370
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,442
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

371
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:59,074
<font color="yellow">It's so obvious. You need to grow up.</font>

372
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:02,236
<font color="yellow">Even if Chairman Yoo is an idiot,<br>would he date Bap Soon?</font>

373
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:05,436
<font color="yellow">Just picture it. Think about it.</font>

374
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:08,969
<font color="yellow">No, they really are dating.<br>It was very extraordinary.</font>

375
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:14,426
<font color="yellow">It must just be a fling,<br>like young people do.</font>

376
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:15,786
<font color="yellow">They're all like that.</font>

377
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:19,796
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there like that.<br>You're making me nervous.</font>

378
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:23,545
<font color="yellow">We're going to have to go a different<br>direction with Sobeol district.</font>

379
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:25,756
<font color="yellow">Why? LE Group isn't<br>transferring their headquarters?</font>

380
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:28,874
<font color="yellow">Because of legal issues,<br>the transfer won't happen.</font>

381
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:30,767
<font color="yellow">Look at the article.</font>

382
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,450
<font color="yellow">Year 2019.</font>

383
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:37,500
<font color="yellow">It's amazing every time I see it.</font>

384
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:40,929
<font color="yellow">I've been curious for a while.</font>

385
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:43,840
<font color="yellow">How come you don't bring anything<br>beyond March, 2019?</font>

386
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,860
<font color="yellow">Isn't it better for us<br>to look further ahead?</font>

387
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:52,159
<font color="yellow">Oh... it's just tiring.</font>

388
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,275
<font color="yellow">It's so far to go there.</font>

389
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,583
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

390
00:26:58,423 --> 00:26:59,609
<font color="yellow">Should I come back?</font>

391
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,200
<font color="yellow">No, no. Come in.</font>

392
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,601
<font color="yellow">About today's management dinner...</font>

393
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,459
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about doing it<br>at my house.</font>

394
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,271
<font color="yellow">- I actually have plans...<br>- Oh, of course!</font>

395
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:11,331
<font color="yellow">You went out of your way to invite us,<br>so of course we should go.</font>

396
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:13,601
<font color="yellow">Then I will expect you there.</font>

397
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:15,690
<font color="yellow">- Yes.<br>- Yes.</font>

398
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,798
<font color="yellow">- See you later.<br>- Okay.</font>

399
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:24,759
<font color="yellow">Here. Drink this while you do it.</font>

400
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,486
<font color="yellow">Why am I even doing this?</font>

401
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,775
<font color="yellow">Friends are supposed<br>to do these things for each other.</font>

402
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,869
<font color="yellow">These are just the basics.</font>

403
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:37,216
<font color="yellow">People would think<br>we are best friends, right?</font>

404
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:39,207
<font color="yellow">Friend.</font>

405
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:43,237
<font color="yellow">By any chance, are you dating anyone<br>these days?</font>

406
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,998
<font color="yellow">No, why?</font>

407
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:50,296
<font color="yellow">You aren't? Really?</font>

408
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,658
<font color="yellow">What if I am?</font>

409
00:27:57,598 --> 00:28:01,179
<font color="yellow">Flower, where are you?<br>Should we meet up tonight?</font>

410
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:04,664
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

411
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:06,105
<font color="yellow">Yes. Go on.</font>

412
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:09,708
<font color="yellow">Do you like being married?</font>

413
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:15,764
<font color="yellow">How did you decide to marry Yong Jin?</font>

414
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:18,830
<font color="yellow">Did someone ask to marry you?</font>

415
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:24,827
<font color="yellow">Oh, they must be here. They're here.</font>

416
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:27,846
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm coming. Welcome.</font>

417
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:29,811
<font color="yellow">- Hello.<br>- Welcome.</font>

418
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,421
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.<br>- Thank you for inviting us.</font>

419
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,063
<font color="yellow">- Hello.<br>- Yes, hello.</font>

420
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:35,388
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

421
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:38,708
<font color="yellow">Wow. This looks great.</font>

422
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,930
<font color="yellow">Wow. This is a nice home.</font>

423
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,855
<font color="yellow">- Come on in.<br>- Hello.</font>

424
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:47,046
<font color="yellow">The interior looks great.</font>

425
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:48,385
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

426
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:51,337
<font color="yellow">I really like your taste.</font>

427
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:53,241
<font color="yellow">You have the same taste as I do.</font>

428
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:57,767
<font color="yellow">Chairman, Chairman?</font>

429
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,417
<font color="yellow">Please sit down.</font>

430
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,734
<font color="yellow">- Sit down, Chairman.<br>- Please sit.</font>

431
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,478
<font color="yellow">Is this your first time here,<br>Secretary Hwang?</font>

432
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:05,219
<font color="yellow">No, I've been here before.</font>

433
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:06,808
<font color="yellow">- I fixed the sink.<br>- He fixed our sink.</font>

434
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, I fixed it.</font>

435
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,190
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to drink?</font>

436
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,100
<font color="yellow">- Yes.<br>- Do you have that schisandra drink?</font>

437
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,670
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll bring it out. Hold on.</font>

438
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,643
<font color="yellow">You didn't say people would come now.</font>

439
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:19,651
<font color="yellow">I didn't?</font>

440
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,340
<font color="yellow">- I'm getting out of here.<br>- Why?</font>

441
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,662
<font color="yellow">Come here. Come on.</font>

442
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:28,978
<font color="yellow">My friend here helped me a lot today.</font>

443
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:31,228
<font color="yellow">I didn't prepare much,<br>but please enjoy the food.</font>

444
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,027
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food.</font>

445
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:35,840
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy your night.<br>I'll be going now.</font>

446
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,827
<font color="yellow">You should stay and eat with us.</font>

447
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:39,676
<font color="yellow">Yes, you should.</font>

448
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,555
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't think so.</font>

449
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:44,951
<font color="yellow">Have fun.</font>

450
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,036
<font color="yellow">You're really leaving?</font>

451
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,834
<font color="yellow">She's leaving? Really?</font>

452
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,209
<font color="yellow">One moment.</font>

453
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,404
<font color="yellow">Why are you sitting on the corner<br>like that?</font>

454
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,923
<font color="yellow">I'm comfortable here.</font>

455
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:01,471
<font color="yellow">The food is good.</font>

456
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,990
<font color="yellow">Just like your name, Bap Soon.</font>

457
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,863
<font color="yellow">Look how much you enjoy your rice.</font>

458
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:12,392
<font color="yellow">Don't you all think she looks familiar?</font>

459
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,215
<font color="yellow">You do look<br>like I've seen you somewhere.</font>

460
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,413
<font color="yellow">She's Bap Soon.</font>

461
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,469
<font color="yellow">"Give me rice", Bap Soon.</font>

462
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:21,813
<font color="yellow">You all know, right?</font>

463
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:25,996
<font color="yellow">She still makes an appearance online<br>every now and then.</font>

464
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:28,055
<font color="yellow">Oh, "Tomorrow's Morning".<br>You're that Bap Soon.</font>

465
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:30,670
<font color="yellow">- "Give me rice", Bap Soon.<br>- Yes.</font>

466
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,565
<font color="yellow">I really liked Bap Soon.</font>

467
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:37,948
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, Gun Sook,<br>I get to see Bap Soon eat rice.</font>

468
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:39,681
<font color="yellow">It's an honor.</font>

469
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,750
<font color="yellow">Do you want an autograph?</font>

470
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,333
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes. Right here, please.</font>

471
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,882
<font color="yellow">Seeing the two of you living here,<br>I want to get married too.</font>

472
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:50,471
<font color="yellow">- Really?<br>- Yes.</font>

473
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:53,401
<font color="yellow">Yes, don't you have anyone<br>to introduce to him?</font>

474
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:56,763
<font color="yellow">We should get Secretary Hwang<br>married first.</font>

475
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:58,456
<font color="yellow">What? Me?</font>

476
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:02,177
<font color="yellow">Mister Hwang? What do you think<br>of our Bap Soon?</font>

477
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:05,094
<font color="yellow">I've thought you two were<br>perfect for each other for a long time.</font>

478
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:09,139
<font color="yellow">I'm actually a pretty popular guy...</font>

479
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:11,139
<font color="yellow">You two suit one another.</font>

480
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:13,747
<font color="yellow">- You do suit each other.<br>- Gun Sook.</font>

481
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,457
<font color="yellow">Can you get me some water?</font>

482
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,878
<font color="yellow">You can get it yourself.</font>

483
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,826
<font color="yellow">It's over there.</font>

484
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,316
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

485
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,365
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

486
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:25,507
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

487
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:27,896
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

488
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:32,689
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Chairman?</font>

489
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:36,286
<font color="yellow">About Secretary Hwang and my friend?</font>

490
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:37,644
<font color="yellow">Aren't they perfect?</font>

491
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:41,359
<font color="yellow">- I don't know.<br>- Why?</font>

492
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,458
<font color="yellow">I know the gossip online isn't good,<br>but she really isn't that bad.</font>

493
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:49,796
<font color="yellow">She suffers so much because of<br>people's preconceptions.</font>

494
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:51,806
<font color="yellow">She can't even get a job.</font>

495
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:55,441
<font color="yellow">Maybe I was being too greedy<br>because she's my friend.</font>

496
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:58,930
<font color="yellow">Honestly, Mister Hwang would be<br>a little too good for her.</font>

497
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,973
<font color="yellow">- A little?<br>- A little bit.</font>

498
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:06,718
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

499
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,603
<font color="yellow">This was so expensive.</font>

500
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,555
<font color="yellow">You did it on purpose, didn't you?</font>

501
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:23,267
<font color="yellow">Yes, so that you would shut up.</font>

502
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:26,843
<font color="yellow">I pitied you for being an outcast</font>

503
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,885
<font color="yellow">so I hung out with you,<br>and what do you do?</font>

504
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:31,296
<font color="yellow">I don't think<br>I can be your friend anymore.</font>

505
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,518
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

506
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,815
<font color="yellow">Clean it up.</font>

507
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:43,201
<font color="yellow">Should we fight like dogs?<br>Who has more to lose?</font>

508
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:45,066
<font color="yellow">Go ahead if you think you can.</font>

509
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:49,687
<font color="yellow">Why are you always trying so hard<br>to drag me down?</font>

510
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,908
<font color="yellow">That's the state you're in.<br>Who are you blaming?</font>

511
00:32:52,908 --> 00:32:55,409
<font color="yellow">You should know your place.</font>

512
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:56,937
<font color="yellow">You crazy...</font>

513
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,748
<font color="yellow">You're ignorant with nothing<br>but strength.</font>

514
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,527
<font color="yellow">You are more ignorant than I am.</font>

515
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:06,402
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend to be cultured.<br>I know your past, you wench.</font>

516
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,180
<font color="yellow">Why don't you scream<br>so everyone outside can hear?</font>

517
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:13,715
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right?<br>- Yes, yes.</font>

518
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:19,385
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

519
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:21,898
<font color="yellow">Keep eating. I'm fine.</font>

520
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:24,016
<font color="yellow">I think you're drunk.</font>

521
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,591
<font color="yellow">I have many courses.</font>

522
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,460
<font color="yellow">How many have I had?</font>

523
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:32,833
<font color="yellow">Do you think I've been your friend<br>without knowing you look down on me?</font>

524
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:36,180
<font color="yellow">Still, it seemed like you<br>depended on me. I pitied you.</font>

525
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,921
<font color="yellow">See, you don't even know your place.</font>

526
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:42,076
<font color="yellow">I just find you an easy person<br>to keep around.</font>

527
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:44,007
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

528
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,372
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know?</font>

529
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,593
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how easy<br>and foolish you are?</font>

530
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,756
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

531
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:53,263
<font color="yellow">even if it's not me,<br>if someone is a little good to you</font>

532
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:54,986
<font color="yellow">don't get delusional.</font>

533
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:58,803
<font color="yellow">Why don't you both stop?</font>

534
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:18,195
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks for letting me know.</font>

535
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:23,355
<font color="yellow">You think I'm an easy fool,<br>and I hate you.</font>

536
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,521
<font color="yellow">Let's not deal with each other anymore.</font>

537
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:34,512
<font color="yellow">It's our problem.</font>

538
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:36,125
<font color="yellow">I'd like it if you pretended<br>not to notice...</font>

539
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,650
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, this makes me angry.<br>- Excuse me?</font>

540
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,443
<font color="yellow">Trying to stand out by poking people<br>where you know it hurts...</font>

541
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:46,125
<font color="yellow">I will remember you<br>as that kind of person.</font>

542
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:51,202
<font color="yellow">Let's see each other often<br>from now on.</font>

543
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,217
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

544
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,980
<font color="yellow">The four of us can meet together.</font>

545
00:34:57,858 --> 00:34:59,496
<font color="yellow">With Song Ma Rin.</font>

546
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:14,097
<font color="yellow">I was crazy.<br>I should know what reality is like.</font>

547
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,838
<font color="yellow">Look at you now. Look at you.</font>

548
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:27,764
<font color="yellow">I'm not picking up. I'm not going to!</font>

549
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:32,264
<font color="yellow">I'm dying of embarrassment,<br>so stop calling.</font>

550
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:56,838
<font color="yellow">Hey, who are you?</font>

551
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:59,590
<font color="yellow">I think I've seen you here before.</font>

552
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,471
<font color="yellow">You got my daughter, Ma Rin, drunk.<br>It's you, right?</font>

553
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:04,818
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Hello.</font>

554
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:06,905
<font color="yellow">Why are you following<br>my daughter around?</font>

555
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:10,900
<font color="yellow">We are a very conservative family.<br>Why are you here so late at night?</font>

556
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:14,797
<font color="yellow">I haven't introduced myself yet.</font>

557
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,032
<font color="yellow">My name is Yoo So Joon.</font>

558
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,851
<font color="yellow">What is this English part? Ceo?</font>

559
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:24,432
<font color="yellow">You're the ceo?</font>

560
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,780
<font color="yellow">I'm the CEO.</font>

561
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:31,264
<font color="yellow">- I'd like to buy you a meal...<br>- Don't follow Ma Rin.</font>

562
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:33,061
<font color="yellow">Look at the time.</font>

563
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,068
<font color="yellow">CEO? What is that? How funny.</font>

564
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,840
<font color="yellow">I told her to date a senior manager,<br>at the very least.</font>

565
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,101
<font color="yellow">- Mother.<br>- How annoying.</font>

566
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:50,644
<font color="yellow">Hey. You're really not eating?</font>

567
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:53,380
<font color="yellow">I bought it for both of us.</font>

568
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,818
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sleep.</font>

569
00:36:54,818 --> 00:36:56,333
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

570
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:01,438
<font color="yellow">You know that guy you came home<br>drunk with before?</font>

571
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,750
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- Never mind. Forget it.</font>

572
00:37:07,617 --> 00:37:10,677
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's so good and chewy.</font>

573
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,951
<font color="yellow">Hey, what does a CEO do?</font>

574
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:20,001
<font color="yellow">It sounds very unstable,<br>just by the sounds of it.</font>

575
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,003
<font color="yellow">It's the chairman of the company.</font>

576
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,702
<font color="yellow">- Huh?<br>- I'm tired.</font>

577
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,813
<font color="yellow">So, the chairman?</font>

578
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,447
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

579
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:36,942
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat it.</font>

580
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:38,509
<font color="yellow">I'll become a ghost who ate and died.</font>

581
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,438
<font color="yellow">No! You'll gain weight.</font>

582
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,434
<font color="yellow">Only I can eat it.</font>

583
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,018
<font color="yellow">Seriously, your personality...</font>

584
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,003
<font color="yellow">Oh, my word. Oh dear.</font>

585
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:57,273
<font color="yellow">This place.</font>

586
00:38:00,054 --> 00:38:02,215
<font color="yellow">What is this place?</font>

587
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,777
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

588
00:38:05,188 --> 00:38:06,820
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

589
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:16,403
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

590
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:36,896
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.</font>

591
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,860
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

592
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:43,731
<font color="yellow">Sorry to bother you,<br>but I have a question.</font>

593
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,817
<font color="yellow">Is there a company<br>called "Myreits" here?</font>

594
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,311
<font color="yellow">It's right upstairs.</font>

595
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:50,922
<font color="yellow">So, it is here.</font>

596
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:53,827
<font color="yellow">I received this business card<br>from the CEO here.</font>

597
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:57,751
<font color="yellow">Is this Yoo So Joon the CEO here?</font>

598
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,612
<font color="yellow">Yes, he is.<br>Should I contact his office for you?</font>

599
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:01,697
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

600
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:05,568
<font color="yellow">It's good enough to know he is.</font>

601
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:08,759
<font color="yellow">You look good in that suit.</font>

602
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:10,418
<font color="yellow">You should lengthen the sleeves.</font>

603
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:29,159
<font color="yellow">I just sent you an email.<br>Please read it.</font>

604
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,367
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

605
00:39:31,664 --> 00:39:34,617
<font color="yellow">I have a bad feeling.</font>

606
00:39:44,152 --> 00:39:46,798
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

607
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,989
<font color="yellow">Realtor.</font>

608
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:51,416
<font color="yellow">I wanted to call you that one last time.</font>

609
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:55,115
<font color="yellow">I just don't think we suit one another.</font>

610
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:59,416
<font color="yellow">I am lacking in so many ways.</font>

611
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,126
<font color="yellow">I am not enough.</font>

612
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,769
<font color="yellow">I'll keep this short.</font>

613
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:09,780
<font color="yellow">"I really hope you don't get hurt".</font>

614
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,798
<font color="yellow">"I want to remain a beautiful<br>memory to you".</font>

615
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:15,307
<font color="yellow">"No, even that is selfish of me".</font>

616
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:20,115
<font color="yellow">"I am a selfish woman and<br>I will be like dust in your life".</font>

617
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:23,577
<font color="yellow">What is this?<br>Why is she going so overboard?</font>

618
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:27,737
<font color="yellow">Why is it so long?</font>

619
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:32,318
<font color="yellow">This would be like ten pages long.</font>

620
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:38,298
<font color="yellow">Is she asking to break up,<br>or is she holding onto me?</font>

621
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:43,378
<font color="yellow">Does she expect me to read it all?</font>

622
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:50,273
<font color="yellow">Why is she acting like that?<br>Is she drunk?</font>

623
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:53,244
<font color="yellow">Gun Sook is really awful.</font>

624
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,309
<font color="yellow">I better tell all the girls<br>about what you went through.</font>

625
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:00,818
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't hang out with her either.</font>

626
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:04,280
<font color="yellow">Of course. We only did because of you.</font>

627
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,034
<font color="yellow">You're all I have, So Ri.</font>

628
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:17,672
<font color="yellow">Realtor is really annoying too.</font>

629
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:19,110
<font color="yellow">What about him?</font>

630
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,711
<font color="yellow">He even asked to marry you.<br>Why did he just watch you suffer?</font>

631
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:27,128
<font color="yellow">He's the chairman and Gun Sook's<br>husband is the director, so why?</font>

632
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:28,925
<font color="yellow">I told him to act<br>like he doesn't know me.</font>

633
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:31,322
<font color="yellow">Still, if he likes you,<br>he should say it.</font>

634
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,628
<font color="yellow">Or he should've flipped the table over.</font>

635
00:41:33,628 --> 00:41:35,340
<font color="yellow">Don't insult Realtor.</font>

636
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,092
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything.</font>

637
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:39,840
<font color="yellow">He wasn't sincere to you at all.</font>

638
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,572
<font color="yellow">He was just having some fun.</font>

639
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:45,652
<font color="yellow">Isn't that obvious?</font>

640
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:48,568
<font color="yellow">There's no reason Realtor<br>would be sincere with me.</font>

641
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:53,869
<font color="yellow">Even if he was sincere,<br>reality probably kicked in at Gun Sook's.</font>

642
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:56,561
<font color="yellow">I really don't suit him.</font>

643
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:07,021
<font color="yellow">Realtor, that punk, is not going to do.</font>

644
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,242
<font color="yellow">Hey, the worst kind of man in the world</font>

645
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:15,278
<font color="yellow">is a man who makes a woman<br>feel shabby.</font>

646
00:42:15,278 --> 00:42:18,072
<font color="yellow">I don't care how great he is.</font>

647
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:21,021
<font color="yellow">If he makes the girl feel shabby,<br>I will rip him apart.</font>

648
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,447
<font color="yellow">It's my fault, my fault.<br>It's my self-condemnation .</font>

649
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:27,277
<font color="yellow">It's the fault of the guy who makes<br>you feel that way.</font>

650
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:30,266
<font color="yellow">Hey, say no even if he offers.</font>

651
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:31,599
<font color="yellow">Don't meet him.</font>

652
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,903
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to.<br>I already told him I'm not.</font>

653
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:39,431
<font color="yellow">Good. My friend is smart.</font>

654
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,211
<font color="yellow">Still, don't insult Realtor.<br>He's a good person.</font>

655
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:46,463
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

656
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:52,655
<font color="yellow">he called me "Flower."</font>

657
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,771
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating chestnuts?</font>

658
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:08,211
<font color="yellow">These are dates, not chestnuts.<br>You're so ignorant.</font>

659
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:09,980
<font color="yellow">These are dates?</font>

660
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,387
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm an urban man, so I don't know<br>much about agricultural goods.</font>

661
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:16,655
<font color="yellow">Like fruits, vegetables, and fish.</font>

662
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:26,567
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

663
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:32,535
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you doing?<br>You must be crazy.</font>

664
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,047
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

665
00:43:36,326 --> 00:43:38,708
<font color="yellow">Why would you meet Yoo So Joon?</font>

666
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,898
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you,<br>he suggested dinner first.</font>

667
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:46,449
<font color="yellow">When I called Yoo So Joon,<br>he said he'd come right away.</font>

668
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:48,519
<font color="yellow">He said, "Yes, Mother".</font>

669
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,298
<font color="yellow">How did you find that a guy like that?<br>Really?</font>

670
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,737
<font color="yellow">I'll meet him today<br>and take care of everything.</font>

671
00:43:57,737 --> 00:44:00,824
<font color="yellow">You pretend not to know anything,<br>okay?</font>

672
00:44:00,824 --> 00:44:03,144
<font color="yellow">How did you even know his number?</font>

673
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:05,322
<font color="yellow">We are not even<br>in any sort of relationship.</font>

674
00:44:05,322 --> 00:44:07,652
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't do this.</font>

675
00:44:07,652 --> 00:44:09,731
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare meet him.</font>

676
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,402
<font color="yellow">I won't speak to you again.</font>

677
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:27,063
<font color="yellow">Yoo So Joon.</font>

678
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:29,012
<font color="yellow">Yoo So Joon!</font>

679
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:33,347
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

680
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:36,119
<font color="yellow">My mom made a mistake, so leave.</font>

681
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,564
<font color="yellow">That wouldn't be polite.</font>

682
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:40,943
<font color="yellow">Why would you need to be polite to<br>my mom?</font>

683
00:44:40,943 --> 00:44:42,324
<font color="yellow">My mom was mistaken about us...</font>

684
00:44:42,324 --> 00:44:44,871
<font color="yellow">Still, she called me.<br>I can't just leave.</font>

685
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:47,480
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait.</font>

686
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:49,880
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

687
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:53,398
<font color="yellow">Didn't you read my email?</font>

688
00:44:54,122 --> 00:44:56,239
<font color="yellow">I didn't read it yet.</font>

689
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,396
<font color="yellow">Well, this isn't right.</font>

690
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:04,626
<font color="yellow">I have an important meeting today.<br>I'll talk to you later.</font>

691
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:05,932
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

692
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:11,730
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be exposed to you<br>more than I already am.</font>

693
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:50,181
<font color="yellow">It was a time in my life<br>when everyone adored me.</font>

694
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:53,251
<font color="yellow">I was my family's hope back then.</font>

695
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:59,391
<font color="yellow">However, the people who liked me<br>turned on me in one quick moment.</font>

696
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:01,952
<font color="yellow">"She won't do. We're tired of her."</font>

697
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:03,820
<font color="yellow">"She's over with."</font>

698
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,313
<font color="yellow">I spent my teenage years<br>facing all that rejection.</font>

699
00:46:08,313 --> 00:46:10,592
<font color="yellow">My dad left during that time.</font>

700
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:13,539
<font color="yellow">I became my mom's pawn<br>to find suitable husbands.</font>

701
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:17,965
<font color="yellow">Like all those people<br>who once loved Bap Soon</font>

702
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:22,952
<font color="yellow">your feelings you profess for me<br>feel like a fleeting bubble to me.</font>

703
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:27,692
<font color="yellow">So, I'm afraid,<br>and I have no confidence.</font>

704
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:31,189
<font color="yellow">It may be my fault for that.</font>

705
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,932
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, that's just me.</font>

706
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:37,699
<font color="yellow">You should leave.</font>

707
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,943
<font color="yellow">Huh? Leave?</font>

708
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:43,153
<font color="yellow">You want me to leave?</font>

709
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,367
<font color="yellow">I said leave.</font>

710
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,458
<font color="yellow">It's hard to even look at you.</font>

711
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,093
<font color="yellow">But, what are we going to do?</font>

712
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:59,471
<font color="yellow">In my eyes...</font>

713
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:02,039
<font color="yellow">I see you telling me not to leave.</font>

714
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,885
<font color="yellow">My mom is here.</font>

715
00:47:48,655 --> 00:47:51,516
<font color="yellow">I'll just say hello and come out.<br>Wait for me.</font>

716
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:55,076
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

717
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:04,343
<font color="yellow">I don't know.<br>We'll break up next time.</font>

718
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:06,472
<font color="yellow">[Cancel Email Delivery]</font>

719
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:09,543
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

720
00:48:09,543 --> 00:48:10,905
<font color="yellow">You got out already?</font>

721
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:13,494
<font color="yellow">I said I was going on a date with you,<br>and she told me to go.</font>

722
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,131
<font color="yellow">Date?</font>

723
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:18,313
<font color="yellow">Let's go to my place.</font>

724
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,376
<font color="yellow">Beer?</font>

725
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:29,306
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

726
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,122
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

727
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:36,280
<font color="yellow">You can wear these.</font>

728
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,751
<font color="yellow">My place is kind of messy, right?</font>

729
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:39,949
<font color="yellow">No, it's really nice.</font>

730
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:41,139
<font color="yellow">You can sit here.</font>

731
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:45,442
<font color="yellow">Ah, you can't go upstairs.</font>

732
00:48:45,442 --> 00:48:46,588
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

733
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,047
<font color="yellow">Privacy. Sit down.</font>

734
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:01,532
<font color="yellow">Oh no. What do I do?<br>I'm all out of beer.</font>

735
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:04,298
<font color="yellow">I don't have a single can of beer.</font>

736
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:08,614
<font color="yellow">I guess today is not a day for drinking.</font>

737
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,983
<font color="yellow">Oh, that scared me.</font>

738
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:19,905
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we go<br>to the convenience store then?</font>

739
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:23,003
<font color="yellow">Let's just drink next time.<br>You're okay with juice, right?</font>

740
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:26,122
<font color="yellow">I suppose there's no choice.</font>

741
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:30,932
<font color="yellow">We could go to the convenience store.</font>

742
00:49:30,932 --> 00:49:34,432
<font color="yellow">How can I act like things are normal<br>while sober?</font>

743
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,806
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

744
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:43,713
<font color="yellow">Is this from the 90's?</font>

745
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:48,271
<font color="yellow">Does he like this tacky style?</font>

746
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:03,775
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

747
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,458
<font color="yellow">What is this thing?</font>

748
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:10,143
<font color="yellow">Hey, what... why are you<br>putting on my shoes?</font>

749
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,713
<font color="yellow">It just wrapped itself<br>around my foot on its own.</font>

750
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:15,608
<font color="yellow">- What is it?<br>- Hey, take it off.</font>

751
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:16,831
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

752
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:18,864
<font color="yellow">Take it off.</font>

753
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:22,967
<font color="yellow">Hey, you can't just<br>put these on like that.</font>

754
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:26,144
<font color="yellow">I've never even<br>gone outside with these things.</font>

755
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:28,418
<font color="yellow">You didn't take pictures of these,<br>did you?</font>

756
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:31,188
<font color="yellow">There will be trouble if you take<br>pictures and put them online.</font>

757
00:50:31,188 --> 00:50:34,336
<font color="yellow">People will come for you.<br>There will be chaos.</font>

758
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:39,204
<font color="yellow">- I'll just leave.<br>- Why? Already?</font>

759
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:43,092
<font color="yellow">Well, I wanted to see your place,<br>and you're only showing me half.</font>

760
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:45,813
<font color="yellow">And you're making me feel really awkward<br>over some shoes.</font>

761
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:48,764
<font color="yellow">Sorry, sorry. I was wrong.<br>Come back.</font>

762
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:52,385
<font color="yellow">No, there's no beer either.</font>

763
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:55,402
<font color="yellow">Your family will probably<br>be home soon anyway.</font>

764
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,295
<font color="yellow">I don't have family.</font>

765
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:04,476
<font color="yellow">My parents... died in a car accident.</font>

766
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:06,271
<font color="yellow">So, come on in. It's okay.</font>

767
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:16,481
<font color="yellow">I lost my parents early in life,<br>but moved up in the world.</font>

768
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:19,481
<font color="yellow">I suppose I'm someone<br>people respect a lot.</font>

769
00:51:20,503 --> 00:51:24,721
<font color="yellow">Then what about being<br>an heir to a rich family?</font>

770
00:51:27,778 --> 00:51:29,568
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

771
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:31,938
<font color="yellow">And I thought...</font>

772
00:51:33,432 --> 00:51:36,847
<font color="yellow">It does seem less complex.</font>

773
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:42,884
<font color="yellow">I don't have any family,<br>so I have a very free life.</font>

774
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:46,372
<font color="yellow">There is no one who would meddle<br>in my life.</font>

775
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,689
<font color="yellow">Must be lonely.</font>

776
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,689
<font color="yellow">Having no one to depend on,<br>isn't it the same for you?</font>

777
00:52:07,843 --> 00:52:12,465
<font color="yellow">The great Song Ma Rin, is the size<br>of all this too much for you?</font>

778
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:16,269
<font color="yellow">This is enough to cover for you, right?</font>

779
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,809
<font color="yellow">All I want is...</font>

780
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:27,081
<font color="yellow">someone who likes me the way I am.</font>

781
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:29,684
<font color="yellow">I want to be able to do something<br>for that person.</font>

782
00:52:31,035 --> 00:52:34,692
<font color="yellow">Someone who is comfortable<br>and fun to be with.</font>

783
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:38,836
<font color="yellow">I don't need anything great.<br>That's the kind of person I like.</font>

784
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,597
<font color="yellow">Nothing great?</font>

785
00:52:40,597 --> 00:52:43,413
<font color="yellow">You didn't expect anything great.</font>

786
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:45,083
<font color="yellow">But, you did get something great.</font>

787
00:52:49,903 --> 00:52:53,403
<font color="yellow">You'd be perfect if you would<br>stop talking about marriage.</font>

788
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:58,146
<font color="yellow">Do you not have a midpoint<br>with your personality?</font>

789
00:52:58,146 --> 00:53:00,697
<font color="yellow">You make it<br>so that I can't have a midpoint.</font>

790
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:04,365
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

791
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,891
<font color="yellow">What did I do<br>to make you act so extreme?</font>

792
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:16,121
<font color="yellow">I feel nervous leaving you alone.</font>

793
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,981
<font color="yellow">I feel like something will happen.</font>

794
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:20,593
<font color="yellow">I keep worrying.</font>

795
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:25,442
<font color="yellow">I usually donât worry<br>about other people.</font>

796
00:53:25,442 --> 00:53:30,304
<font color="yellow">Strangely, I really want to be involved<br>in your life.</font>

797
00:53:32,064 --> 00:53:33,744
<font color="yellow">I think that would be right.</font>

798
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:36,951
<font color="yellow">- Right?<br>- Yes.</font>

799
00:53:38,246 --> 00:53:42,213
<font color="yellow">Rather than being apart...</font>

800
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:44,199
<font color="yellow">I think we should be together.</font>

801
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:47,050
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should<br>ignore each other.</font>

802
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:51,106
<font color="yellow">We should overcome everything together.</font>

803
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:53,284
<font color="yellow">I think that is the right thing.</font>

804
00:53:53,284 --> 00:53:57,333
<font color="yellow">So, stay by my side.</font>

805
00:53:57,333 --> 00:54:00,923
<font color="yellow">So that I can protect you.</font>

806
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:09,585
<font color="yellow">Put your future in my hands.</font>

807
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,405
<font color="yellow">Future...</font>

808
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:20,056
<font color="yellow">Just don't bring up marriage.</font>

809
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,122
<font color="yellow">That makes you seem weird.</font>

810
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,724
<font color="yellow">Well, if you leave out marriage...</font>

811
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:31,814
<font color="yellow">I guess I can date you once.</font>

812
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:35,521
<font color="yellow">Hey, then are we dating now?</font>

813
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:38,492
<font color="yellow">Depends on how you do.</font>

814
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:41,797
<font color="yellow">We're really dating, right?</font>

815
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:44,137
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming so close?</font>

816
00:54:44,137 --> 00:54:46,173
<font color="yellow">Huh? It's just...</font>

817
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:48,902
<font color="yellow">I want to confirm it.</font>

818
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:50,570
<font color="yellow">Are we really dating?</font>

819
00:54:56,718 --> 00:54:58,916
<font color="yellow">Oh, by the way...</font>

820
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:05,601
<font color="yellow">You have really pretty hands.</font>

821
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,652
<font color="yellow">You have a pretty nose.</font>

822
00:55:09,778 --> 00:55:11,396
<font color="yellow">- Ma Rin.<br>- Yes?</font>

823
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:16,188
<font color="yellow">Should we go?</font>

824
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:19,262
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

825
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:30,934
<font color="yellow">Can we do this?</font>

826
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:32,028
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

827
00:55:33,512 --> 00:55:36,157
<font color="yellow">This soon?</font>

828
00:55:36,157 --> 00:55:37,342
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

829
00:56:05,677 --> 00:56:07,480
<font color="yellow">- So Joon.<br>- Yes?</font>

830
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,852
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

831
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:09,981
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

832
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:28,023
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married.</font>

833
00:56:28,023 --> 00:56:30,019
<font color="yellow">- What, girl!<br>- Wow.</font>

834
00:56:31,324 --> 00:56:33,766
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.<br>- Thank you.</font>

835
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:36,278
<font color="yellow">- I'm getting married.<br>- You're finally getting married.</font>

836
00:56:36,278 --> 00:56:38,168
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, really.</font>

837
00:56:38,168 --> 00:56:39,567
<font color="yellow">She's so pretty, isn't she?</font>

838
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,247
<font color="yellow">Calm down, would you?</font>

839
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:43,769
<font color="yellow">The invitations came out.<br>You have to come.</font>

840
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:46,163
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations!<br>- Congratulations!</font>

841
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:48,545
<font color="yellow">- Here you go!<br>- Here.</font>

842
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:50,727
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

843
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:52,942
<font color="yellow">- Are you that happy?<br>- Yes, so happy!</font>

844
00:56:55,137 --> 00:56:56,885
<font color="yellow">Yay!</font>

845
00:56:56,885 --> 00:56:59,338
<font color="yellow">Kiss, kiss, kiss.</font>

846
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:11,552
<font color="yellow">Ma Rin, you have to do it.</font>

847
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:15,088
<font color="yellow">Mother, please let me marry Ma Rin.</font>

848
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:17,034
<font color="yellow">I will take good care of her.</font>

849
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,559
<font color="yellow">Mother, please.</font>

850
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:24,563
<font color="yellow">What now? Oh my.</font>

851
00:57:24,563 --> 00:57:26,014
<font color="yellow">What, what?</font>

852
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:39,416
<font color="yellow">Are we getting married?</font>

853
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:58,798
<font color="yellow">Taking the picture now.<br>One, two, three.</font>

854
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:00,454
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

855
00:58:00,454 --> 00:58:02,718
<font color="yellow">Lower the heart a little.</font>

856
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:04,489
<font color="yellow">Just a little bit. We'll go again.</font>

857
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,518
<font color="yellow">One, two, three. That was great.</font>

858
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:10,358
<font color="yellow">Can the bride smile a little bit more?<br>That's good.</font>

859
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:13,843
<font color="yellow">Okay. One, two, three.</font>

860
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:20,436
<font color="yellow">Let's go. One, two, three.</font>

861
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:35,235
<font color="yellow">Se Young, let's leave early today.</font>

862
00:58:35,235 --> 00:58:38,009
<font color="yellow">We need to get ready<br>for So Joon's wedding tomorrow.</font>

863
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:39,336
<font color="yellow">It's already tomorrow?</font>

864
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:41,567
<font color="yellow">Get ready to leave.</font>

865
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:44,143
<font color="yellow">How many days are you going<br>to stay up working late for?</font>

866
00:58:45,057 --> 00:58:47,737
<font color="yellow">So Joon's getting married.<br>Why do I need to get ready?</font>

867
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:48,802
<font color="yellow">I'm not the bride.</font>

868
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:53,057
<font color="yellow">We have to take pictures tomorrow<br>and so on.</font>

869
00:58:59,731 --> 00:59:03,356
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the store.<br>Do you want something to drink?</font>

870
00:59:04,298 --> 00:59:05,684
<font color="yellow">Get me some cigarettes.</font>

871
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:07,875
<font color="yellow">I said drink.</font>

872
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,934
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

873
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:16,724
<font color="yellow">He never dated anyone.</font>

874
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:20,996
<font color="yellow">Why is he in such a hurry?</font>

875
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:28,481
<font color="yellow">[So Joon]</font>

876
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,300
<font color="yellow">I'm in a meeting.<br>See you at the wedding tomorrow.</font>

877
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,809
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shin Se Young.</font>

878
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:36,519
<font color="yellow">Is she busy?</font>

879
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:38,335
<font color="yellow">Is she mad at me about something?</font>

880
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:40,923
<font color="yellow">She won't even show me her face.<br>It's kind of hurtful.</font>

881
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:42,677
<font color="yellow">She's been working really hard lately.</font>

882
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:44,548
<font color="yellow">Still, I'm getting married tomorrow.</font>

883
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:47,387
<font color="yellow">You know that's how Se Young is,<br>and we don't have time for dinner.</font>

884
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:50,097
<font color="yellow">How do you plan<br>on moving all this today?</font>

885
00:59:50,097 --> 00:59:51,666
<font color="yellow">Where is your new apartment?</font>

886
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:54,338
<font color="yellow">Me? I'm moving to yours.</font>

887
00:59:54,338 --> 00:59:55,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

888
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,909
<font color="yellow">I'm moving to your place.<br>Isn't that the obvious thing to do?</font>

889
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:01,949
<font color="yellow">Crazy punk... crazy.<br>Hey, no you can't.</font>

890
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:05,090
<font color="yellow">I have my personal life too.<br>You didn't even ask me.</font>

891
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,378
<font color="yellow">It's so nice moving in here.</font>

892
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:12,762
<font color="yellow">I just feel a bit guilty.</font>

893
01:00:12,762 --> 01:00:13,914
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

894
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:16,753
<font color="yellow">It feels like you have two homes.</font>

895
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:21,689
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to tell<br>Ma Rin about the other world?</font>

896
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:24,054
<font color="yellow">She is your family now,<br>so shouldn't you be honest?</font>

897
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:27,275
<font color="yellow">Even if I tell her the truth,<br>I can't be honest about everything.</font>

898
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:28,814
<font color="yellow">What else are you hiding?</font>

899
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,414
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I'll tell you everything later.</font>

900
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:35,872
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

901
01:00:37,202 --> 01:00:40,102
<font color="yellow">What do you think marriage is?</font>

902
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:43,653
<font color="yellow">A housemate with a lifelong contract.</font>

903
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:45,699
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

904
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:47,105
<font color="yellow">I guess that's not wrong.</font>

905
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:50,288
<font color="yellow">I don't know why people put so much<br>meaning into marriage.</font>

906
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:53,646
<font color="yellow">You can just live the way you did<br>while respecting each other's style.</font>

907
01:00:53,646 --> 01:00:56,155
<font color="yellow">You can live comfortably like that.<br>Don't you think?</font>

908
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,226
<font color="yellow">Maybe not.</font>

909
01:00:59,226 --> 01:01:01,266
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married tomorrow.</font>

910
01:01:03,586 --> 01:01:06,497
<font color="yellow">To that man I met on the subway.</font>

911
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,628
<font color="yellow">I'll live a good life.</font>

912
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,742
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

913
01:01:29,288 --> 01:01:30,768
<font color="yellow">It's a rain shower.</font>

914
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:43,081
<font color="yellow">Bride and groom, enter.</font>

915
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:54,945
<font color="yellow">Even on a day<br>when rain falls from a clear sky</font>

916
01:02:54,945 --> 01:03:00,027
<font color="yellow">there will be many days in life<br>when it will rain.</font>

917
01:03:00,963 --> 01:03:05,005
<font color="yellow">When it does, these two people<br>will join hands tightly.</font>

918
01:03:05,005 --> 01:03:07,425
<font color="yellow">They will be each other's umbrellas.</font>

919
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:11,056
<font color="yellow">They have promised to<br>protect each other with love's umbrella.</font>

920
01:03:17,217 --> 01:03:21,664
<font color="yellow">Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!</font>

921
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:31,932
<font color="yellow">It's really amazing.</font>

922
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,467
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

923
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:36,934
<font color="yellow">You said it seemed<br>like it would rain today.</font>

924
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:39,288
<font color="yellow">You told me we shouldn't do<br>an outdoor wedding.</font>

925
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:43,664
<font color="yellow">You trusted the weather forecast<br>over my senses.</font>

926
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:47,034
<font color="yellow">That's the strange part.</font>

927
01:03:47,034 --> 01:03:49,593
<font color="yellow">How are you always<br>more precise than the forecast?</font>

928
01:03:50,932 --> 01:03:52,372
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

929
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:54,063
<font color="yellow">Look here and smile.</font>

930
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,644
<font color="yellow">Yes, that looks good.</font>

931
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:59,458
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

932
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,914
<font color="yellow">That looks good. Everything's great.</font>

933
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:04,574
<font color="yellow">Now, face each other lovingly.</font>

934
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,713
<font color="yellow">Good. Don't move. Just like that.</font>

935
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:10,938
<font color="yellow">Okay. One, two, three.</font>

936
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:24,535
<font color="yellow">Mine... my husband.</font>

937
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:28,693
<font color="yellow">He is really handsome.</font>

938
01:04:30,385 --> 01:04:31,704
<font color="yellow">Is he dead?</font>

939
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:35,735
<font color="yellow">He's alive.</font>

940
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:39,534
<font color="yellow">He is alive!</font>

941
01:04:42,564 --> 01:04:46,777
<font color="yellow">He's my husband from here,<br>and he's my husband from over here.</font>

942
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:51,564
<font color="yellow">See you later, mine.</font>

943
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,336
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.<br>Where did mine go?</font>

944
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,414
<font color="yellow">Here he is!</font>

945
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,809
<font color="yellow">Hold on now.<br>Where did mine go?</font>

946
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:06,684
<font color="yellow">There he is!</font>

947
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:11,242
<font color="yellow">Mine, mine... where are you?</font>

948
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,701
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

949
01:05:29,409 --> 01:05:31,179
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming out?<br>You should go in.</font>

950
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:33,106
<font color="yellow">It's your first day at work<br>since we got married.</font>

951
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:35,579
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to do this.</font>

952
01:05:36,077 --> 01:05:38,324
<font color="yellow">What a strange thing to want to do.<br>I'll be going now.</font>

953
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:42,864
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

954
01:05:45,836 --> 01:05:47,284
<font color="yellow">Have a nice day.</font>

955
01:05:48,664 --> 01:05:50,085
<font color="yellow">My husband.</font>

956
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,686
<font color="yellow">Come home early.</font>

957
01:05:58,510 --> 01:05:59,619
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

958
01:06:01,606 --> 01:06:04,393
<font color="yellow">That man and I...</font>

959
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:07,663
<font color="yellow">That woman and I...</font>

960
01:06:08,586 --> 01:06:10,512
<font color="yellow">- got married.<br>- got married.</font>

961
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:27,416
