<font color="yellow">I'm saying that we should talk about this...</font>

128
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:54,363
<font color="yellow">after thinking about it for enough time.</font>

129

133
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,034
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure how long she can keep quiet.</font>

134
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,633
<font color="yellow">She asked where you're staying,</font>

135
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:24,534
<font color="yellow">and whether you're living with Dong Jin.</font>

136
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,363
<font color="yellow">- We had such a hard time. - I'm sorry.</font>

137

<font color="yellow">They are talking in his room.</font>

140
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:35,104
<font color="yellow">I guess Mr Lee noticed.</font>

141
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:37,933
<font color="yellow">I think he did.</font>

142
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,604
<font color="yellow">It should happen anyway.</font>

143
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,104

148

149
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,363

151

<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry.</font>

152
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:45,264
<font color="yellow">If we show him that we're sincere,</font>

153
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:47,364
<font color="yellow">he will be on our side.</font>

00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,264
<font color="yellow">It's bad luck if you don't get married in six months.</font>

157
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,364
<font color="yellow">We should hurry.</font>

158
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,004
<font color="yellow">It can't be common for...</font>

159
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:06,733
<font color="yellow">a couple to catch the bouquet together.</font>

160
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,904
<font color="yellow">It must be a lucky sign, so...</font>

161
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:19,364
<font color="yellow">Don't waver.</font>

162
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,233
<font color="yellow">Leave my mum to my dad.</font>

163
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:25,504
<font color="yellow">Why won't you answer?</font>

164
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,534
<font color="yellow">- I will. - At times like this...</font>

165
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,134
<font color="yellow">we must work together.</font>

166
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,634
<font color="yellow">Don't get distracted, okay?</font>

167
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,473
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

168
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,164
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me, Tae Yang.</font>

169
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,164
<font color="yellow">I left in a hurry that I didn't get to say bye.</font>

170
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:54,563
<font color="yellow">I was worried because you left without eating.</font>

171
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,203
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

172
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,603
<font color="yellow">No. I recently got a new part-time job and...</font>

173
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:00,973
<font color="yellow">it's all the way in Gangnam.</font>

174
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:04,733
<font color="yellow">Why do you sound downcast?</font>

175
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,664
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

176
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:11,603
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you over the phone. Let's meet up one day.</font>

177
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:14,473
<font color="yellow">Did you and Dong Jin argue?</font>

178
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,264
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't.</font>

179
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,504
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll call you after work.</font>

180
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,563
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

181
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:27,703
<font color="yellow">- This is the current trend. - I see.</font>

182
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:31,264
<font color="yellow">- He has to stand out. - Like that.</font>

183
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,034
<font color="yellow">Hello. How are you?</font>

184
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:42,764
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

185
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:44,973
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

186
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:48,164
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

187
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,864
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

188
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:58,134
<font color="yellow">We were discussing today's shoot with the photographer.</font>

189
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,563
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - I've never seen...</font>

190
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,664
<font color="yellow">such hands-on manager and stylist team.</font>

191
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:06,134
<font color="yellow">A manager and stylist?</font>

192
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,634
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

193
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:14,733
<font color="yellow">I wanted to come alone but Mum insisted on tagging along.</font>

194
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,963
<font color="yellow">I had no choice.</font>

195
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:18,864
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Tae Yang.</font>

196
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,563
<font color="yellow">You should be grateful I'm here.</font>

197
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,833
<font color="yellow">If you have someone with my gravitas around,</font>

198
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,833
<font color="yellow">they won't take you too lightly.</font>

199
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,504
<font color="yellow">When you signed the contract...</font>

200
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:34,364
<font color="yellow">I got you 300 dollars more, didn't I?</font>

201
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,664
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm grateful for that.</font>

202
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,703
<font color="yellow">Keep being grateful.</font>

203
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,904
<font color="yellow">I'm not here because I'm free.</font>

204
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,134
<font color="yellow">You're here because you were bored.</font>

205
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,504
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

206
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:50,703
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. - Let's begin.</font>

207
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,864
<font color="yellow">- Tae Yang, get your make-up done. - Okay.</font>

208
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,233
<font color="yellow">I'll go and get my make-up done.</font>

209
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:59,664
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about us. Go and get dolled up.</font>

210
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,264
<font color="yellow">See you in a bit.</font>

211
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,333
<font color="yellow">Don't slather too much make-up on him.</font>

212
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,264
<font color="yellow">Make it look as natural as possible.</font>

213
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,433
<font color="yellow">Kang star's appeal is his natural look.</font>

214
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:22,603
<font color="yellow">"Kang star"?</font>

215
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,534
<font color="yellow">People on TV...</font>

216
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:27,404
<font color="yellow">say things like "so-and-so star".</font>

217
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,004
<font color="yellow">You're helpless.</font>

218
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,134
<font color="yellow">Will you just keep quiet?</font>

219
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:33,404
<font color="yellow">Don't make things harder for him.</font>

220
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:36,904
<font color="yellow">Making certain demands helps them decide what to do.</font>

221
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,534
<font color="yellow">You used to work. Shouldn't you know the basics?</font>

222
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,164
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

223
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:44,563
<font color="yellow">this is why your staff ignored you.</font>

224
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,433
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

225
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,264
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. - Sorry.</font>

226
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,733
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. - Sorry.</font>

227
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:58,463
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

228
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,803
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

229
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,803
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm loving this.</font>

230
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:13,103
<font color="yellow">This time...</font>

231
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:16,233
<font color="yellow">I want you to hold your left hand at the back of your neck.</font>

232
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,603
<font color="yellow">Okay, that's great. Please look at the camera.</font>

233
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,803
<font color="yellow">That's it. Now look into the distance.</font>

234
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,803
<font color="yellow">Good. Now look at the camera.</font>

235
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,634
<font color="yellow">Give us a smile, to the camera.</font>

236
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,164
<font color="yellow">Kang star.</font>

237
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,404
<font color="yellow">Try to look more at ease.</font>

238
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:31,463
<font color="yellow">You look way too stiff.</font>

239
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,634
<font color="yellow">Loosen up a bit.</font>

240
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:36,504
<font color="yellow">Smile with the corners of your mouth.</font>

241
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,864
<font color="yellow">No, that looks fake.</font>

242
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:45,733
<font color="yellow">Smile naturally, like you're greeting...</font>

243
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,063
<font color="yellow">customers at the hamburger place.</font>

244
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,864
<font color="yellow">"Welcome. What can I get for you?"</font>

245
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,504
<font color="yellow">"Welcome. What can I get for you?"</font>

246
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,063
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's more like it.</font>

247
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,634
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, Mum.</font>

248
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:04,963
<font color="yellow">I got frustrated.</font>

249
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,233
<font color="yellow">Let's continue.</font>

250
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,433
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

251
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:14,504
<font color="yellow">Your make-up needs fixing.</font>

252
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:17,534
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

253
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:19,803
<font color="yellow">Now you look pretty.</font>

254
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,534
<font color="yellow">His make-up needed fixing. Sorry.</font>

255
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,303
<font color="yellow">- Let's continue. - Kang star.</font>

256
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,803
<font color="yellow">- Good luck. - Good luck.</font>

257
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:31,303
<font color="yellow">Get the stool and put a foot on it.</font>

258
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,904
<font color="yellow">That's it. That's perfect.</font>

259
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:36,264
<font color="yellow">Put your leg on it and glare at the camera.</font>

260
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:39,203
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

261
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,664
<font color="yellow">You're so stiff. You look like a robot.</font>

262
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:42,963
<font color="yellow">Do this.</font>

263
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,164
<font color="yellow">Can't you even pose? Try harder.</font>

264
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,764
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

265
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,833
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

266
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:04,703
<font color="yellow">Now you try.</font>

267
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,833
<font color="yellow">Stretch.</font>

268
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,433
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let me fix his make-up a bit more.</font>

269
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,233
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Stretch.</font>

270
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:24,933
<font color="yellow">Hold this.</font>

271
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,504
<font color="yellow">Get out of here!</font>

272
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,864
<font color="yellow">- Us? - Us?</font>

273
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,164
<font color="yellow">I can't get anything done.</font>

274
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,203
<font color="yellow">If you don't get out of here, this shoot is cancelled.</font>

275
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:44,833
<font color="yellow">- What did we do to upset him? - I don't know.</font>

276
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,333
<font color="yellow">Get out of here!</font>

277
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:52,904
<font color="yellow">Good luck, honey.</font>

278
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:57,634
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

279
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,333
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

280
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:03,864
<font color="yellow">Don't set foot out of this room.</font>

281
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:09,203
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen.</font>

282
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,703
<font color="yellow">You aren't the photographer. You went too far.</font>

283
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,634
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep retouching his make-up?</font>

284
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:16,864
<font color="yellow">You aren't an expert.</font>

285
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:17,963
<font color="yellow">Is this my fault?</font>

286
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,233
<font color="yellow">Is it mine, then?</font>

287
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:28,803
<font color="yellow">It's Hyo Sang.</font>

288
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,833
<font color="yellow">Hello, son.</font>

289
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:34,933
<font color="yellow">- Where are you? - Me?</font>

290
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:38,164
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

291
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:41,203
<font color="yellow">in town to meet a friend.</font>

292
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:42,664
<font color="yellow">Which friend?</font>

293
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:47,733
<font color="yellow">- Sook Ja. - Sook Ja flew in from Toronto.</font>

294
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:50,433
<font color="yellow">Didn't she come by last month?</font>

295
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,203
<font color="yellow">Is she back again?</font>

296
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:55,634
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth. You aren't with her, are you?</font>

297
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,404
<font color="yellow">- Don't tell him. - Okay, son.</font>

298
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:00,404
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at home.</font>

299
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,433
<font color="yellow">Mum. Hello?</font>

300
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:04,903
<font color="yellow">Hello? Mum?</font>

301
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:09,833
<font color="yellow">Who is she with that she can't talk to me about?</font>

302
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,633
<font color="yellow">Hang on. Is she with Tae Yang?</font>

303
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,863
<font color="yellow">Does your mum spend time with him?</font>

304
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:20,633
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

305
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,234
<font color="yellow">She seems to like him.</font>

306
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:24,234
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

307
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:28,833
<font color="yellow">He lacks everything that your mum would like in a man.</font>

308
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,234
<font color="yellow">That's exactly my point.</font>

309
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,204
<font color="yellow">What does she and Hyo Won...</font>

310
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:34,303
<font color="yellow">see in that jerk?</font>

311
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,563
<font color="yellow">Why did you like him way back then?</font>

312
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:40,363
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang.</font>

313
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:42,633
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

314
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:44,434
<font color="yellow">I got too excited.</font>

315
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,204
<font color="yellow">Sorry if I upset you.</font>

316
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,063
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

317
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,903
<font color="yellow">- Are you done? - I've had enough.</font>

318
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,863
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your appetite?</font>

319
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:10,173
<font color="yellow">I had too much rich food this afternoon.</font>

320
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,563
<font color="yellow">- I think I feel bloated. - Do you want an antacid?</font>

321
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:14,633
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

322
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,603
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? It's cold outside.</font>

323
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:22,602
<font color="yellow">I want to get some fresh air.</font>

324
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:24,734
<font color="yellow">Finish your meal and don't worry about me.</font>

325
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:29,833
<font color="yellow">Does he feel unwell?</font>

326
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:51,363
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat much. Have some warm rice water instead.</font>

327
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,403
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

328
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:58,764
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

329
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:02,964
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

330
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,234
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that I became...</font>

331
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,363
<font color="yellow">an ungrateful brat...</font>

332
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:11,863
<font color="yellow">who took advantage of you.</font>

333
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,103
<font color="yellow">You're not a brat.</font>

334
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:17,504
<font color="yellow">You can't control who you fall in love with.</font>

335
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:22,403
<font color="yellow">But then every human being...</font>

336
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:26,234
<font color="yellow">has a position or opinion.</font>

337
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,173
<font color="yellow">Let's take some time to think.</font>

338
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,964
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

339
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:33,764
<font color="yellow">Are you upset?</font>

340
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:37,434
<font color="yellow">No. You're very right.</font>

341
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,633
<font color="yellow">Don't take it the wrong way.</font>

342
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:44,333
<font color="yellow">We treated you like you were our own,</font>

343
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:50,133
<font color="yellow">but we never imagined you as Dong Jin's spouse.</font>

344
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,534
<font color="yellow">We were taken off-guard.</font>

345
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:54,633
<font color="yellow">Let's give it some time.</font>

346
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:56,964
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

347
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,173
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

348
00:19:58,673 --> 00:19:59,673
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

349
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:03,504
<font color="yellow">It's cold out here, so don't stay out too long.</font>

350
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,534
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

351
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,204
<font color="yellow">Where are you off to?</font>

352
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:27,903
<font color="yellow">I forgot that a customer said he'd come by for a fitting.</font>

353
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,173
<font color="yellow">- What about dinner? - I'm not hungry.</font>

354
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:31,833
<font color="yellow">I'll have some bread...</font>

355
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,863
<font color="yellow">I'll have some cup noodles at the store if I feel hungry.</font>

356
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,173
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

357
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:37,204
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

358
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,563
<font color="yellow">You're too dressed up...</font>

359
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,363
<font color="yellow">- for someone going to the store. - What?</font>

360
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:52,264
<font color="yellow">Should I greet a customer in a tracksuit, then?</font>

361
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:54,964
<font color="yellow">Stop nitpicking, okay?</font>

362
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,803
<font color="yellow">There's no need to yell.</font>

363
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:00,234
<font color="yellow">No tailor's wife should say what you said.</font>

364
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,434
<font color="yellow">You lack the basic knowledge.</font>

365
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,704
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine, go.</font>

366
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:07,234
<font color="yellow">I might be late.</font>

367
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:08,903
<font color="yellow">Don't wait up.</font>

368
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,903
<font color="yellow">Why is he so clumsy? Does he have tremors?</font>

369
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,434
<font color="yellow">He's been petty lately.</font>

370
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,034
<font color="yellow">Must I eat alone?</font>

371
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,264
<font color="yellow">That's so heavy.</font>

372
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:53,163
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

373
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,034
<font color="yellow">To the kitchen, right?</font>

374
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:56,563
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

375
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,504
<font color="yellow">- Can I do anything else for you? - No thanks.</font>

376
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,004
<font color="yellow">Who is he, Mum?</font>

377
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,504
<font color="yellow">He's an old friend from my childhood.</font>

378
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,633
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

379
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:22,663
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

380
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,504
<font color="yellow">I remember seeing you when you were asleep.</font>

381
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,103
<font color="yellow">You haven't seen me yet.</font>

382
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:32,103
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

383
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,504
<font color="yellow">Shall we shake hands?</font>

384
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:41,234
<font color="yellow">It must be great to have a son.</font>

385
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:42,434
<font color="yellow">He's a young man.</font>

386
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,063
<font color="yellow">I'll go inside to clean up.</font>

387
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,704
<font color="yellow">You're great at drawing.</font>

388
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:56,234
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

389
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:57,704
<font color="yellow">My dad.</font>

390
00:22:57,863 --> 00:22:59,103
<font color="yellow">Your dad?</font>

391
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:02,863
<font color="yellow">Why did you draw a black ribbon?</font>

392
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:04,764
<font color="yellow">That's his photo.</font>

393
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:08,163
<font color="yellow">- What? - It's the photo...</font>

394
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:10,264
<font color="yellow">we had at his funeral.</font>

395
00:23:31,603 --> 00:23:35,403
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should be at a motel on our honeymoon.</font>

396
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:39,004
<font color="yellow">We'll only stay for one night and a hotel's too expensive.</font>

397
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,633
<font color="yellow">We need to save up.</font>

398
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,833
<font color="yellow">You're right, but we'll have only one honeymoon in lifetime.</font>

399
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,004
<font color="yellow">This is not romantic at all.</font>

400
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,534
<font color="yellow">Romance isn't good for anything.</font>

401
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:55,833
<font color="yellow">We have to save up as much as we can.</font>

402
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:59,764
<font color="yellow">We'll end up with nothing if we do what everyone else does.</font>

403
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,663
<font color="yellow">I'm the one to blame.</font>

404
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:06,663
<font color="yellow">Who cares if we stay at a hotel or a motel?</font>

405
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:10,764
<font color="yellow">Anywhere I am with you is paradise to me.</font>

406
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,063
<font color="yellow">How about you?</font>

407
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:15,163
<font color="yellow">I feel the same.</font>

408
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:18,133
<font color="yellow">Then stop grumbling and come inside.</font>

409
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:22,004
<font color="yellow">I was up since dawn and the stress has drained me completely.</font>

410
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:24,704
<font color="yellow">It's not the greatest of settings, but I'll serve you...</font>

411
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:26,534
<font color="yellow">the best I can, Madam.</font>

412
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,103
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

413
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:46,363
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

414
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,133
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

415
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,663
<font color="yellow">- There's no room? - There's no room?</font>

416
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:10,603
<font color="yellow">We're full.</font>

417
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:15,234
<font color="yellow">How can such a large motel not have one empty room?</font>

418
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,833
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow's Christmas eve.</font>

419
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,403
<font color="yellow">Did you expect us to have a room on a Friday evening?</font>

420
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:22,633
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

421
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,603
<font color="yellow">Let's try another motel.</font>

422
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:28,333
<font color="yellow">You can try, but you won't have any luck.</font>

423
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:32,803
<font color="yellow">There is one VIP suite...</font>

424
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,563
<font color="yellow">How much for a night in that suite?</font>

425
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:37,303
<font color="yellow">300 dollars.</font>

426
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,833
<font color="yellow">- 300 dollars? - 300 dollars?</font>

427
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:42,934
<font color="yellow">That room's only free because someone cancelled...</font>

428
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,464
<font color="yellow">at the last minute.</font>

429
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:46,163
<font color="yellow">Forget it if you aren't interested.</font>

430
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:49,264
<font color="yellow">Someone else will snap it up right away.</font>

431
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:52,103
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This is daylight robbery.</font>

432
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,833
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we report him?</font>

433
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,403
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

434
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:57,833
<font color="yellow">We'll call the police outside.</font>

435
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:17,333
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he tried to overcharge us.</font>

436
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,234
<font color="yellow">What kind of a motel charges 300 dollars for a night?</font>

437
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:22,603
<font color="yellow">A Friday before Christmas eve is a peak holiday.</font>

438
00:26:22,603 --> 00:26:24,934
<font color="yellow">Even so, this is too much.</font>

439
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:28,704
<font color="yellow">I saw another motel on the way here.</font>

440
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,204
<font color="yellow">Let's try that one.</font>

441
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,363
<font color="yellow">You wait here.</font>

442
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,863
<font color="yellow">I'll ask if they have a room.</font>

443
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,303
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

444
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:05,504
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

445
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,363
<font color="yellow">I was too curious to wait.</font>

446
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,734
<font color="yellow">- Are you at the hotel? - What?</font>

447
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,534
<font color="yellow">Of course we are.</font>

448
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,633
<font color="yellow">- We just arrived. - What about dinner?</font>

449
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,464
<font color="yellow">We went to a famous beef rib restaurant on the way.</font>

450
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,034
<font color="yellow">We had a huge meal.</font>

451
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:21,534
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that. What is Tae Pyung doing?</font>

452
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,633
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung?</font>

453
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:25,633
<font color="yellow">He went in to take a shower.</font>

454
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:30,103
<font color="yellow">What happened to Dong Jin and Yun Shil?</font>

455
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:33,333
<font color="yellow">I don't think Grandma knows.</font>

456
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:35,163
<font color="yellow">Only Grandpa knows.</font>

457
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:39,603
<font color="yellow">I still can't believe that Dong Jin and Yun Shil are in love.</font>

458
00:27:39,603 --> 00:27:41,103
<font color="yellow">Neither can I.</font>

459
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:46,363
<font color="yellow">It looks like my dear mum's about to get the shock of her life.</font>

460
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:51,734
<font color="yellow">I'll have to call you back.</font>

461
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,663
<font color="yellow">Okay. Enjoy your honeymoon.</font>

462
00:27:54,663 --> 00:27:56,563
<font color="yellow">I will. Thanks.</font>

463
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:01,764
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

464
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,133
<font color="yellow">They're full as well.</font>

465
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,133
<font color="yellow">That's terrible.</font>

466
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,333
<font color="yellow">Let's find another motel before it gets too late.</font>

467
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,234
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

468
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:25,964
<font color="yellow">Take those off. I'll do it.</font>

469
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:28,004
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I'm almost done.</font>

470
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:31,133
<font color="yellow">You cooked since dawn today. You need to go and rest.</font>

471
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:34,603
<font color="yellow">Get out before your mum sees us and starts another row.</font>

472
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:36,934
<font color="yellow">She fell asleep already.</font>

473
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:38,004
<font color="yellow">Give me those.</font>

474
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,363
<font color="yellow">I really don't mind.</font>

475
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,633
<font color="yellow">But I do.</font>

476
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:45,603
<font color="yellow">I'll finish up. Go to your room and rest.</font>

477
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,563
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

478
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:57,333
<font color="yellow">You're up early.</font>

479
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,534
<font color="yellow">I got thirsty. Maybe the dinner was salty for me.</font>

480
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,504
<font color="yellow">What are you doing wearing rubber gloves?</font>

481
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:08,133
<font color="yellow">Since Yun Shil must be tired making all the food from early morning,</font>

482
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:09,764
<font color="yellow">I will do the dishes.</font>

483
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:12,163
<font color="yellow">Take off the rubber gloves.</font>

484
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:15,034
<font color="yellow">Men do kitchen work nowadays, Mum.</font>

485
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:16,734
<font color="yellow">Don't talk rubbish.</font>

486
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,103
<font color="yellow">Take off the gloves and give them to me.</font>

487
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,163
<font color="yellow">I can do the dishes, Ms Choi.</font>

488
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:33,303
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Dong Jin? Go and do your own business.</font>

489
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:36,833
<font color="yellow">All right, Mum.</font>

490
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,563
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ms Choi.</font>

491
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:48,133
<font color="yellow">I will do it.</font>

492
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:55,303
<font color="yellow">Even if Dong Jin says he will help you since he feels sorry,</font>

493
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,663
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't let him do so, Yun Shil.</font>

494
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,034
<font color="yellow">Until the present,</font>

495
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:03,403
<font color="yellow">I haven't asked him to do any housework.</font>

496
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:05,663
<font color="yellow">Then, how can you...</font>

497
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,034
<font color="yellow">make my son wear the rubber gloves, Yun Shil?</font>

498
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:09,964
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask him...</font>

499
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:13,063
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ms Choi.</font>

500
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,504
<font color="yellow">You should be careful yourself if you want to stay in this house.</font>

501
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:19,464
<font color="yellow">In the tailor shop,</font>

502
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:23,363
<font color="yellow">you cannot help being friendly because of work.</font>

503
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:26,303
<font color="yellow">You should draw a line in the house, though.</font>

504
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,103
<font color="yellow">You should keep your private life and public life separate.</font>

505
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:31,764
<font color="yellow">I'll keep that in mind.</font>

506
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,363
<font color="yellow">I don't want Dong Jin...</font>

507
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:37,403
<font color="yellow">to be gossiped because of useless misunderstanding.</font>

508
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,464
<font color="yellow">I won't allow it even if it's concerned with you, Yun Shil.</font>

509
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:45,103
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I mean?</font>

510
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:47,234
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

511
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,303
<font color="yellow">- Mum is doing too much. - Wait.</font>

512
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,363
<font color="yellow">A man should not intervene in women's matter.</font>

513
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,603
<font color="yellow">You should be careful when you're with your mum.</font>

514
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:01,704
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

515
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,379
<font color="yellow">I should have met his parents,</font>

516
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:19,103
<font color="yellow">lay bare the truth and distinguish between right and wrong.</font>

517
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:21,403
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

518
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:25,603
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Yun Shil hiding?</font>

519
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,764
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - This is Min Hyo Joo.</font>

520
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:35,333
<font color="yellow">It's you. How have you been?</font>

521
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,234
<font color="yellow">I called you to give you some good news.</font>

522
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,363
<font color="yellow">Good news?</font>

523
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,303
<font color="yellow">It seems that you can see your son by next month.</font>

524
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:42,403
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

525
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:44,964
<font color="yellow">- Is that true? - Yes.</font>

526
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,534
<font color="yellow">I talked to the lawyer a minute ago.</font>

527
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:50,204
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that Gi Pyo...</font>

528
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:53,464
<font color="yellow">will be released next month?</font>

529
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:55,333
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's almost certain.</font>

530
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:57,663
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

531
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:01,534
<font color="yellow">How can I repay you?</font>

532
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:03,833
<font color="yellow">I don't need such words.</font>

533
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,204
<font color="yellow">You should control your daughter-in-law instead.</font>

534
00:32:07,964 --> 00:32:09,764
<font color="yellow">She left home.</font>

535
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:13,803
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean she left home? - After listening to what you said,</font>

536
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,464
<font color="yellow">I made a decision and came to Seoul.</font>

537
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,163
<font color="yellow">Then I found out that she ran left home.</font>

538
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:20,403
<font color="yellow">Did she run away from home?</font>

539
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:23,363
<font color="yellow">She must have moved in with that tailor shop owner.</font>

540
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:26,133
<font color="yellow">She doesn't come home at all.</font>

541
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,863
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

542
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:31,833
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

543
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:33,734
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

544
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:38,333
<font color="yellow">You're home, Mother.</font>

545
00:32:39,563 --> 00:32:42,803
<font color="yellow">- You're here. - Where have you been until now?</font>

546
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:45,504
<font color="yellow">I talked you on the phone that I would meet Sook Ja.</font>

547
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:47,863
<font color="yellow">You met aunt Sook Ja of Toronto?</font>

548
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:49,063
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

549
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:52,264
<font color="yellow">Sure? I just talked aunt Sook Ja on the phone just now.</font>

550
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:56,363
<font color="yellow">- What? - She's doing very well in Toronto.</font>

551
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:58,163
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

552
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:01,333
<font color="yellow">Did I tell you that I was with Sook Ja?</font>

553
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:08,034
<font color="yellow">I must be so old that I say wrong things.</font>

554
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,863
<font color="yellow">I didn't meet Sook Ja. I met Sook Hee.</font>

555
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:21,764
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's a menopausal symptom.</font>

556
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:25,434
<font color="yellow">My mouth has a hard time keeping up with my brain.</font>

557
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,764
<font color="yellow">Are you telling the truth?</font>

558
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,633
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? What if I'm not telling the truth?</font>

559
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:31,903
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Hyo Sang.</font>

560
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:35,803
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

561
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,303
<font color="yellow">what are you doing here?</font>

562
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,803
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.</font>

563
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,464
<font color="yellow">I came to pay your respects.</font>

564
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,004
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

565
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,534
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do tomorrow?</font>

566
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,863
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun wants to see a movie.</font>

567
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,464
<font color="yellow">We'll have a meal together and watch a movie.</font>

568
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,163
<font color="yellow">It should be fun.</font>

569
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:56,633
<font color="yellow">Can I join?</font>

570
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:00,403
<font color="yellow">You're going too far.</font>

571
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:03,534
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow is not just any day. It's Christmas eve.</font>

572
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,363
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't join us tactlessly.</font>

573
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:09,303
<font color="yellow">It was a joke.</font>

574
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:11,863
<font color="yellow">You don't expect me to be that tactless, do you?</font>

575
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:12,963
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

576
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,963
<font color="yellow">It was just a joke, wasn't it?</font>

577
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:17,133
<font color="yellow">I was worried that you might have meant it.</font>

578
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:21,334
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's a bad idea...</font>

579
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,233
<font color="yellow">that she joins us, Hyo Sang.</font>

580
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,003
<font color="yellow">You're so weird.</font>

581
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:30,073
<font color="yellow">- What? - I clearly said it was a joke.</font>

582
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:32,104
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

583
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:35,733
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun was worried that you might be lonely.</font>

584
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,003
<font color="yellow">- Why do you get angry? - No.</font>

585
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:39,104
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

586
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,434
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

587
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:52,664
<font color="yellow">I said that because I care for her.</font>

588
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:55,463
<font color="yellow">I don't know why she looks on me with a jaundiced eye.</font>

589
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:58,303
<font color="yellow">She's not angry with you.</font>

590
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,003
<font color="yellow">She's angry at me.</font>

591
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:09,934
<font color="yellow">Do you want to spend Christmas Eve with Mum?</font>

592
00:35:10,264 --> 00:35:11,733
<font color="yellow">Does she have any special plan?</font>

593
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:13,363
<font color="yellow">I don't know,</font>

594
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:16,034
<font color="yellow">but it's our first Christmas Eve together.</font>

595
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,963
<font color="yellow">How can we spend it with Mum? It will be a damp squib.</font>

596
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,604
<font color="yellow">Why will it be a damp squib?</font>

597
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,704
<font color="yellow">I can't let that happen.</font>

598
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:27,903
<font color="yellow">We should have a romantic Christmas Eve...</font>

599
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:29,233
<font color="yellow">just the two of us.</font>

600
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,573
<font color="yellow">Would you go on an overnight skiing trip?</font>

601
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:33,363
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to ski.</font>

602
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:36,233
<font color="yellow">Then we can just go on an overnight trip to any place near.</font>

603
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,264
<font color="yellow">I have a part time job.</font>

604
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:40,003
<font color="yellow">We can leave after you're done with your part time job.</font>

605
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:41,764
<font color="yellow">I will reserve a hotel room.</font>

606
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:44,903
<font color="yellow">- A hotel room? - Let's...</font>

607
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:47,733
<font color="yellow">spend our bridal night.</font>

608
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:51,633
<font color="yellow">I thought you're innocent, but you're cheeky.</font>

609
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:01,034
<font color="yellow">We can't stay out overnight, just the two of us.</font>

610
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,664
<font color="yellow">I think you don't love me, Kang Tae Yang.</font>

611
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:08,573
<font color="yellow">My friends' boyfriends...</font>

612
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,604
<font color="yellow">pester them to go on a trip.</font>

613
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:14,133
<font color="yellow">How can you reject when I ask you to go on a trip?</font>

614
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:17,204
<font color="yellow">To trust each other,</font>

615
00:36:17,664 --> 00:36:20,534
<font color="yellow">we need to get know each other for enough time.</font>

616
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:26,363
<font color="yellow">Before I set up conditions that I can love you responsibly,</font>

617
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,704
<font color="yellow">I won't act hastily.</font>

618
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:30,834
<font color="yellow">I promised that to Mother.</font>

619
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:34,863
<font color="yellow">Since I'm confident that I will love you for a long time,</font>

620
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,834
<font color="yellow">I don't want to rush about our relationship.</font>

621
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,264
<font color="yellow">We can go on a trip anytime.</font>

622
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,503
<font color="yellow">Instead, I will treat you big tomorrow.</font>

623
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:46,233
<font color="yellow">I earned the greatest deal of money in my life today.</font>

624
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:49,233
<font color="yellow">You'd better be prepared.</font>

625
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:52,604
<font color="yellow">I will let you spend all the money you made today.</font>

626
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,903
<font color="yellow">We should have a room-warming party.</font>

627
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,003
<font color="yellow">A room-warming party?</font>

628
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:38,863
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

629
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,903
<font color="yellow">Let's have a nice room-warming party later,</font>

630
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:43,073
<font color="yellow">and drink beer today.</font>

631
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:45,764
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

632
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:54,764
<font color="yellow">Don't get upset about...</font>

633
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:56,633
<font color="yellow">what my mum said.</font>

634
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,334
<font color="yellow">I apologise instead.</font>

635
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,164
<font color="yellow">She said what she had to say from her stance.</font>

636
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:04,363
<font color="yellow">She objected my sister's marriage so much,</font>

637
00:38:04,403 --> 00:38:06,303
<font color="yellow">but she consented at the end.</font>

638
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:08,303
<font color="yellow">So let's not be discouraged.</font>

639
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,573
<font color="yellow">it's different from Dong Sook's case.</font>

<font color="yellow">Both my sister and I are Mum's children.</font>

642
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:20,403
<font color="yellow">I envied her all the more.</font>

643
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,764
<font color="yellow">When I get off from work every night, I can sit here,</font>

644
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:28,204
<font color="yellow">talk about daily life and all with you while drinking beer.</font>

645
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:29,604
<font color="yellow">It would be so nice.</font>

646
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:31,573
<font color="yellow">It will be nice for us,</font>

647
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,573
<font color="yellow">but what about Mr Lee and Ms Choi?</font>

648
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:35,034
<font color="yellow">Every mum in the world...</font>

650
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:39,903
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

651
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:43,573
<font color="yellow">If I were Ms Choi,</font>

652
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:46,764
<font color="yellow">I won't just feel happy...</font>

653

654
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:50,233

655
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,503
<font color="yellow">you always end up talking about me.</font>

656

772
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:46,803
<font color="yellow">but It's our first night as a married couple.</font>

773
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:48,834
<font color="yellow">We need to do something special.</font>

774
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:52,303
<font color="yellow">Sir, may I sing a song?</font>

775
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,303
<font color="yellow">That would be great.</font>

776
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:55,034
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

777
00:47:56,934 --> 00:48:00,034
<font color="yellow">"Susanna's Handkerchief", which brought us together.</font>

778
00:48:00,403 --> 00:48:02,034
<font color="yellow">Let me sing that for you.</font>

779
00:48:05,863 --> 00:48:11,233
<font color="yellow">When I looked at you, my blindingly beautiful you</font>

780
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:18,764
<font color="yellow">I used to cry in quiet</font>

781
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:25,334
<font color="yellow">Then, without saying a word</font>

782
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:33,303
<font color="yellow">you would hand me a small handkerchief</font>

783
00:48:33,863 --> 00:48:38,803
<font color="yellow">One day, you asked me</font>

784
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:46,463
<font color="yellow">To leave you before the end comes</font>

785
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:54,403
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted me to see you only while you were beautiful</font>

786
00:48:55,034 --> 00:49:01,204
<font color="yellow">You said to leave you there</font>

787
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:05,403
<font color="yellow">Susanna</font>

788
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:08,863
<font color="yellow">I will stay</font>

789
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:11,003
<font color="yellow">By your side</font>

790
00:49:11,003 --> 00:49:16,264
<font color="yellow">I won't let go of your hands</font>

791
00:49:16,264 --> 00:49:19,664
<font color="yellow">We will be</font>

792
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:23,233
<font color="yellow">Happy together</font>

793
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:26,534
<font color="yellow">I love you forever</font>

794
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:30,363
<font color="yellow">Don't cry alone any more</font>

795
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:37,564
<font color="yellow">Even if life separates us</font>

796
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:43,564
<font color="yellow">Even if the world hates us</font>

797
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,733
<font color="yellow">I will protect you</font>

798
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:54,564
<font color="yellow">With every ounce of strength that I have</font>

799
00:49:54,863 --> 00:49:58,303
<font color="yellow">I love you</font>

800
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:12,463
<font color="yellow">Susanna</font>

801
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,233
<font color="yellow">I will stay</font>

802
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:18,264
<font color="yellow">By your side</font>

803
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:23,434
<font color="yellow">I won't let go of your hands</font>

804
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:26,803
<font color="yellow">We will be</font>

805
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:30,633
<font color="yellow">Happy together</font>

806
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:33,934
<font color="yellow">I love you forever</font>

807
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:38,334
<font color="yellow">Don't cry alone any more</font>

808
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:47,764
<font color="yellow">Don't think too much, and go to sleep.</font>

809
00:50:48,363 --> 00:50:50,264
<font color="yellow">Worrying won't change anything.</font>

810
00:50:50,803 --> 00:50:51,863
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

811
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:53,733
<font color="yellow">Let's be positive.</font>

812
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:56,164
<font color="yellow">Who would have thought we'd be living...</font>

813
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:57,503
<font color="yellow">under the same roof?</font>

814
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:01,903
<font color="yellow">But we are living under the same roof,</font>

815
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:05,204
<font color="yellow">and soon enough, we will be in the same room.</font>

816
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:14,704
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go.</font>

817
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:18,863
<font color="yellow">It's even harder to leave you since we're in the same house.</font>

818
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:22,064
<font color="yellow">I feel like this room is 10km from my room.</font>

819
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:25,764
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

820
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,503
<font color="yellow">May I just sleep here and go to my room...</font>

821
00:51:29,604 --> 00:51:31,363
<font color="yellow">- early in the morning? - What?</font>

822
00:51:32,104 --> 00:51:34,534
<font color="yellow">Don't be so gross.</font>

823
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:36,733
<font color="yellow">What are you imagining?</font>

824
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:39,164
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to sleep here.</font>

825
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,434
<font color="yellow">Were you...</font>

826
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:44,604
<font color="yellow">What improper thing were you imagining?</font>

827
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:47,733
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I did no such thing.</font>

828
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:49,534
<font color="yellow">Just go to bed.</font>

829
00:51:49,903 --> 00:51:51,903
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good night.</font>

830
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:08,204
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in there?</font>

831
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:13,934
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is kind and talented.</font>

832
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:16,233
<font color="yellow">She's a great catch.</font>

833
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,334
<font color="yellow">Yes, well,</font>

834
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:21,303
<font color="yellow">she and Dong Jin weren't a good fit at first and fought,</font>

835
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:24,534
<font color="yellow">but now, they are a great fit and get along well.</font>

836
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,863
<font color="yellow">If you had a daughter-in-law like her,</font>

837
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:28,503
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't have to worry.</font>

838
00:52:28,764 --> 00:52:30,764
<font color="yellow">Please stop Dong-jin.</font>

839
00:52:30,934 --> 00:52:32,233
<font color="yellow">From what?</font>

840
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:34,463
<font color="yellow">He has a new woman.</font>

841
00:52:34,564 --> 00:52:35,733
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

842
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,664
<font color="yellow">You know her, too.</font>

843
00:52:38,604 --> 00:52:41,034
<font color="yellow">No way. It couldn't be.</font>

844
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:44,034
<font color="yellow">What am I imagining?</font>

845
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:56,733
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh. Who is this?</font>

846
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:58,303
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

847
00:52:58,604 --> 00:53:00,264
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming out from there?</font>

848
00:53:00,564 --> 00:53:02,503
<font color="yellow">Never mind. It's complicated.</font>

849
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:06,104
<font color="yellow">Also, I think this is the medicine that you take.</font>

850
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,704
<font color="yellow">Take it when you need it.</font>

851
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:13,363
<font color="yellow">- Didn't you go on your honeymoon? - Well...</font>

852
00:53:15,534 --> 00:53:16,564
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

853
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:18,403
<font color="yellow">Good morning to you, too.</font>

854
00:53:19,064 --> 00:53:20,264
<font color="yellow">Look who's here.</font>

855
00:53:20,704 --> 00:53:21,834
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

856
00:53:22,564 --> 00:53:25,363
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? Didn't you go on your honeymoon?</font>

857
00:53:25,764 --> 00:53:27,303
<font color="yellow">Let's talk downstairs.</font>

858
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:30,403
<font color="yellow">We were about to greet Mum and Dad anyway.</font>

859
00:53:34,303 --> 00:53:35,534
<font color="yellow">We're back.</font>

860
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:48,003
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Dong Sook. You are so you.</font>

861
00:53:48,363 --> 00:53:50,064
<font color="yellow">Of all the place to skimp out.</font>

862
00:53:50,064 --> 00:53:51,434
<font color="yellow">You wanted to save on motel cost...</font>

863
00:53:51,903 --> 00:53:54,104
<font color="yellow">and came back without having your first night.</font>

864
00:53:54,503 --> 00:53:57,133
<font color="yellow">I never knew she was so determined.</font>

865
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:01,434
<font color="yellow">The family grew, so we should tighten our belts.</font>

866
00:54:01,434 --> 00:54:04,034
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I'm so upset.</font>

867
00:54:05,463 --> 00:54:07,034
<font color="yellow">Anyway, welcome back.</font>

868
00:54:07,564 --> 00:54:10,503
<font color="yellow">Good times will come if you work hard.</font>

869
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:11,934
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

870
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,363
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Goodness.</font>

871
00:54:34,363 --> 00:54:35,463
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

872
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:36,903
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

873
00:54:37,664 --> 00:54:39,463
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare breakfast.</font>

874
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:41,363
<font color="yellow">Get ready for work.</font>

875
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:44,633
<font color="yellow">I can do both without being late.</font>

876
00:54:45,264 --> 00:54:48,363
<font color="yellow">I'm too tired to talk, so don't talk to me and do as I say.</font>

877
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:51,034
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

878
00:54:53,463 --> 00:54:54,503
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

879
00:54:55,264 --> 00:54:56,334
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

880
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:00,704
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

881
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,834
<font color="yellow">Go and get ready for work.</font>

882
00:55:03,863 --> 00:55:04,903
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

883
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:21,604
<font color="yellow">You must have worked late at the shop last night.</font>

884
00:55:22,503 --> 00:55:23,503
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

885
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:26,303
<font color="yellow">I had to finish up a suit...</font>

886
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:27,604
<font color="yellow">and some alterations.</font>

887
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:29,064
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

888
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:31,233
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you. - Okay.</font>

889
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:38,564
<font color="yellow">Wait until I catch you.</font>

890
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,604
<font color="yellow">You're dead.</font>

891
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:53,503
<font color="yellow">- Are you waiting for Yun Shil? - Yes, I am.</font>

892
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,003
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

893
00:55:55,303 --> 00:55:57,003
<font color="yellow">If my wife asks you...</font>

894
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:59,834
<font color="yellow">if I worked late last night, tell her I did.</font>

895
00:56:00,264 --> 00:56:01,534
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

896
00:56:02,164 --> 00:56:04,133
<font color="yellow">You've been acting suspicious lately.</font>

897
00:56:04,303 --> 00:56:06,704
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? There's a situation, that's all.</font>

898
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:08,704
<font color="yellow">You know I can't lie.</font>

899
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:11,903
<font color="yellow">- If you're doing something... - Hey, hey. It isn't like that.</font>

900
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:14,233
<font color="yellow">Then why are you telling me to lie to her?</font>

901
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,164
<font color="yellow">Hi. I'll go ahead. Take your time.</font>

902
00:56:24,863 --> 00:56:25,863
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

903
00:56:36,003 --> 00:56:38,463
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law left home.</font>

904
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:41,434
<font color="yellow">She must have moved in with that tailor shop owner.</font>

905
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,164
<font color="yellow">She doesn't come home at all.</font>

906
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:47,403
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have. No way.</font>

907
00:56:48,803 --> 00:56:51,034
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't be living together.</font>

908
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:58,664
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Hello?</font>

909
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:01,534
<font color="yellow">- Are you busy? - No, I'm not busy.</font>

910
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:02,803
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

911
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,264
<font color="yellow">can you come to the house?</font>

912
00:57:06,064 --> 00:57:07,133
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

913
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:09,764
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

914
00:57:15,463 --> 00:57:18,204
<font color="yellow">I hope you weren't busy.</font>

915
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:21,764
<font color="yellow">Even if I am, I should come running if you want to see me.</font>

916
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:26,003
<font color="yellow">I brought your favourite sweet potato cake.</font>

917
00:57:26,303 --> 00:57:28,164
<font color="yellow">Have it with Father later.</font>

918
00:57:28,834 --> 00:57:30,664
<font color="yellow">Thanks. Let's sit.</font>

919
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:32,233
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

920
00:57:36,963 --> 00:57:39,664
<font color="yellow">How pretty.</font>

921
00:57:39,863 --> 00:57:41,834
<font color="yellow">Are you going out on a date with your boyfriend?</font>

922
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,034
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's Christmas Eve.</font>

923
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:51,164
<font color="yellow">I wish you a merry Christmas</font>

924
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:54,863
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

925
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,834
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - What?</font>

926
00:57:57,963 --> 00:58:00,363
