<font color="yellow">I think I can...</font>

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,610
<font color="yellow">forget about the past...</font>

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,680
<font color="yellow">and start with you.</font>

00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,710
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,680
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Tae Yang. Thank you so much.</font>

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,840
<font color="yellow">I tried hard to win your heart...</font>

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,340
<font color="yellow">but you didn't seem to budge.</font>

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="yellow">I pretended I wasn't, but I was really worried.</font>

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,480
<font color="yellow">Thanks for telling me what's on your mind.</font>

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,980
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,710
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Hyo Won.</font>

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,750
<font color="yellow">Compared to you,</font>

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,810
<font color="yellow">I don't have a lot to offer.</font>

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,510
<font color="yellow">As you have seen, I'm not from a rich family, either.</font>

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,110
<font color="yellow">In some way,</font>

21
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,010
<font color="yellow">it'll be a bad bargain for you.</font>

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,110
<font color="yellow">Love isn't a business.</font>

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,440
<font color="yellow">Who cares about loss or gain in love?</font>

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,510
<font color="yellow">I've always been horrible at math.</font>

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,780
<font color="yellow">So I hate doing calculations.</font>

26
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,440
<font color="yellow">I never used to study math even as a student, and I'm older now.</font>

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,940
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have to do math just because I'm dating you, should I?</font>

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,380
<font color="yellow">Things are so simple with you.</font>

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,310
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you fell for me?</font>

30
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,780
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,440
<font color="yellow">- How much longer do we have to go? - We're almost there, Ma'am.</font>

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,010
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Hyo Sang. - Where are you, Mum?</font>

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,080
<font color="yellow">I was reading, and I just realised that you aren't home.</font>

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,150
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,310
<font color="yellow">going to Kang Tae Yang's house.</font>

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,310
<font color="yellow">What? The gosiwon?</font>

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,080
<font color="yellow">No, I'm going to his parents' place.</font>

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,410
<font color="yellow">Why are you going there?</font>

39
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,380
<font color="yellow">When I spoke to Hyo Won on the phone earlier,</font>

40
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,740
<font color="yellow">she said that she was going there to meet his mum.</font>

41
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,480
<font color="yellow">I had forgotten about it.</font>

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
<font color="yellow">So you're actually going there at this late hour?</font>

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second. How did you even find the address?</font>

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,110
<font color="yellow">My quick wits got me to where I am now.</font>

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,240
<font color="yellow">Gathering that much intel isn't even a problem.</font>

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,240
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I must say that Hyo Won is such a troublemaker.</font>

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,080
<font color="yellow">Whom does she take after? She has such bad taste in men.</font>

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,180
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

50
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,980
<font color="yellow">It's not like Ji Yun is any better.</font>

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,040
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Ji Yun?</font>

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,180
<font color="yellow">She's sly, and she thinks about her interests and gains first.</font>

53
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,810
<font color="yellow">I know exactly what kind of girl she is.</font>

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,980
<font color="yellow">Why do you think so negatively of her?</font>

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,780
<font color="yellow">Gosh, cut it out. Your sister is giving me enough headache.</font>

56
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,540
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about her some other time.</font>

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,180
<font color="yellow">- Let's hurry. - Yes, Ma'am.</font>

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,780
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Yang.</font>

59
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,310
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Won.</font>

60
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,040
<font color="yellow">You two.</font>

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,740
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you a serious lesson today.</font>

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,210
<font color="yellow">If we start over...</font>

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,310
<font color="yellow">I can do better this time.</font>

64
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,710
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

65
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,310
<font color="yellow">I want to start over with you.</font>

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,610
<font color="yellow">Start over with me?</font>

67
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,480
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding?</font>

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that he's seeing someone like her.</font>

69
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,110
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to make everything go back to the way it should be.</font>

70
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,140
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

71
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,450
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi will worry about you. Shouldn't you go home early?</font>

72
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,810
<font color="yellow">I can certainly enjoy a glass of drink on a day like today.</font>

73
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,610
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. We'd like a bottle of soju and...</font>

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat?</font>

75
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,240
<font color="yellow">Chicken feet.</font>

76
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
<font color="yellow">Do you eat chicken feet?</font>

77
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,740
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's so delicious.</font>

78
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,610
<font color="yellow">We'll get one serving of chicken feet and rolled omelette.</font>

79
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,640
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you can eat chicken feet. You're so tough.</font>

81
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,040
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,510
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be brave.</font>

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,380
<font color="yellow">Today was another long and hard day.</font>

84
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,540
<font color="yellow">Thanks for being patient and sticking it out.</font>

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,210
<font color="yellow">I should thank you.</font>

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,210
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo's mum insulted you...</font>

87
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,810
<font color="yellow">and made harsh remarks about you, but you didn't even get upset.</font>

88
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,310
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I'm so grateful for everything you've done for me,</font>

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,310
<font color="yellow">and it also made me realise how mature and thoughtful you are.</font>

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,510
<font color="yellow">I got so worked up when I saw that person earlier...</font>

91
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,680
<font color="yellow">and whined at you.</font>

92
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,010
<font color="yellow">You totally did. You still have a lot of growing up to do.</font>

93
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,510
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

94
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,140
<font color="yellow">It's no fun if you just admit it like that.</font>

95
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,510
<font color="yellow">It's true, though.</font>

96
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,980
<font color="yellow">The situation isn't the greatest for both of us now,</font>

97
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,680
<font color="yellow">so let's make sure to ask and check with each other,</font>

98
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
<font color="yellow">and talk things through at all times.</font>

99
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,740
<font color="yellow">At the very least, we shouldn't misunderstand each other.</font>

100
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,340
<font color="yellow">Letting your imagination run wild and jumping to conclusions alone...</font>

101
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,140
<font color="yellow">is such a foolish thing to do.</font>

102
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,510
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Let's eat.</font>

103
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,510
<font color="yellow">okay.</font>

104
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,810
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

105
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,680
<font color="yellow">Try this.</font>

106
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,210
<font color="yellow">It's so chewy and tasty.</font>

107
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,640
<font color="yellow">I'm not a picky eater, but I can't...</font>

108
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,380
<font color="yellow">eat that. You go ahead.</font>

109
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,840
<font color="yellow">Come on. Just give it a try.</font>

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,910
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

111
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh, just try it.</font>

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,780
<font color="yellow">- Here. Try it. - Goodness.</font>

113
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,180
<font color="yellow">Chew it well.</font>

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,210
<font color="yellow">Chew it well.</font>

115
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,780
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you two are having so much fun.</font>

116
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,310
<font color="yellow">You're feeding each other.</font>

117
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,340
<font color="yellow">I was wondering who the sweet couple was.</font>

118
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,180
<font color="yellow">It's you and Mr Lee.</font>

119
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,580
<font color="yellow">What a lovely sight.</font>

120
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,480
<font color="yellow">We're just having a drink. Please do not bother us.</font>

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,810
<font color="yellow">Don't mind them. Let's eat.</font>

122
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,880
<font color="yellow">We warned you, but it doesn't look like you got the message.</font>

123
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,340
<font color="yellow">Should I talk some sense into you?</font>

124
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

125
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,080
<font color="yellow">You're being too reckless for your own good.</font>

126
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,280
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo's mum is fuming mad right now.</font>

127
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,810
<font color="yellow">How can you have a drink with the guy you're having an affair with...</font>

128
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,680
<font color="yellow">at this late hour?</font>

129
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,580
<font color="yellow">I clearly warned you guys not to bother us.</font>

130
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,240
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so scared.</font>

131
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,940
<font color="yellow">You warned us?</font>

132
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,740
<font color="yellow">Your ways...</font>

133
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,740
<font color="yellow">might have worked with Yun Shil, but not with me.</font>

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,580
<font color="yellow">- Don't make me repeat myself. - What's this jerk saying?</font>

135
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,840
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Don't be afraid.</font>

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
<font color="yellow">Put your hands off her, you punk!</font>

137
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,180
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

138
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
<font color="yellow">Let him go.</font>

139
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,110
<font color="yellow">Ms, please call the police!</font>

140
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,910
<font color="yellow">These guys are using violence towards an innocent man.</font>

141
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,610
<font color="yellow">Now that you've fallen for a man, you don't realise the situation.</font>

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,140
<font color="yellow">I won't suffer as I used to before, okay?</font>

143
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,210
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

144
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,480
<font color="yellow">shouldn't come and threaten me again.</font>

145
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,040
<font color="yellow">If you do, I'll send you to the jail.</font>

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,580
<font color="yellow">She's totally out of her mind.</font>

147
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,440
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo told us to lie low for a while.</font>

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
<font color="yellow">Let's call it a day.</font>

149
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,380
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

150
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,310
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

151
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

152
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,710
<font color="yellow">It was embarrassing as people were watching us, right? I'm sorry.</font>

153
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,380
<font color="yellow">That's what those guys want.</font>

154
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,010
<font color="yellow">If you avoid them for embarrassment and worry about rumours,</font>

155
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,410
<font color="yellow">they'll come for you again.</font>

156
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,180
<font color="yellow">As I told you before,</font>

157
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,640
<font color="yellow">if they are tough on you, we should be tough on them, too.</font>

158
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,380
<font color="yellow">In fact,</font>

159
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,680
<font color="yellow">as I see how you reacted,</font>

160
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,480
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should worry about you.</font>

161
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,810
<font color="yellow">I had nothing to be scared of when you were with me.</font>

162
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,010
<font color="yellow">You are brave...</font>

163
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,840
<font color="yellow">and daring in expressing your love.</font>

164
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,050
<font color="yellow">I really like you.</font>

165
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,580
<font color="yellow">How can you make a joke in this situation?</font>

166
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,410
<font color="yellow">For some time,</font>

167
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,740
<font color="yellow">they might visit you and bully you.</font>

168
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,880
<font color="yellow">If you get upset and distressed each time,</font>

169
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,440
<font color="yellow">you're fooled by their trick.</font>

170
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,080
<font color="yellow">So we should face it like it's nothing.</font>

171
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,980
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

172
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
<font color="yellow">What happened to your button?</font>

173
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,240
<font color="yellow">It must have come off.</font>

174
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,740
<font color="yellow">Shall I take this shirt off?</font>

175
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,210
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

176
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,210
<font color="yellow">I can put on the button while you have your shirt on.</font>

177
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,280
<font color="yellow">All done.</font>

178
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,910
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

179
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,740
<font color="yellow">Thank you for enduring today,</font>

180
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,510
<font color="yellow">and thank you for putting on the button.</font>

181
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,180
<font color="yellow">What I can do for you...</font>

182
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,310
<font color="yellow">are just those kinds of things.</font>

183
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,480
<font color="yellow">Those are enough for me.</font>

184
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,310
<font color="yellow">Don't even think that you're sorry for me.</font>

185
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,540
<font color="yellow">I'm overly happy to</font>

186
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,410
<font color="yellow">be together with you,</font>

187
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,940
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
<font color="yellow">Tell me straight.</font>

189
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,410
<font color="yellow">When did you start loving me?</font>

190
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,480
<font color="yellow">I was not in a situation to love somebody.</font>

191
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,310
<font color="yellow">I was not sure at first...</font>

192
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,480
<font color="yellow">then I became falling for you.</font>

193
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,380
<font color="yellow">Since you are so bright and innocent,</font>

194
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,180
<font color="yellow">you washed away the wounds and darkness inside me.</font>

195
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,380
<font color="yellow">After then...</font>

196
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,810
<font color="yellow">I realised that you are not just an innocent person,</font>

197
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,180
<font color="yellow">but you overcame your own wounds.</font>

198
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,810
<font color="yellow">That's how I got to trust you.</font>

199
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,380
<font color="yellow">I'm happy to hear that.</font>

200
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,010
<font color="yellow">I thought, when I'm with you...</font>

201
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,640
<font color="yellow">I could smile and overcome...</font>

202
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,740
<font color="yellow">any difficult situation.</font>

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,780
<font color="yellow">What a big compliment it is!</font>

204
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,310
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

205
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,910
<font color="yellow">You are the only one who can see the real me.</font>

206
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,610
<font color="yellow">By the way, Hyo Won,</font>

207
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,480
<font color="yellow">I haven't told you one thing.</font>

208
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,310
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

209
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
<font color="yellow">In fact,</font>

210
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,180
<font color="yellow">I was concerned whether I should tell you this...</font>

211
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,580
<font color="yellow">before I confess my love to you.</font>

212
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,510
<font color="yellow">Is it a serious matter?</font>

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
<font color="yellow">In a degree, yes.</font>

214
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,010
<font color="yellow">Do you have to say that today?</font>

215
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,380
<font color="yellow">If I say it later, it might be misleading.</font>

216
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,480
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it.</font>

217
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,910
<font color="yellow">Today is...</font>

218
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,740
<font color="yellow">a happy day as you confessed your love to me.</font>

219
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,810
<font color="yellow">I don't want to break the mood.</font>

220
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,440
<font color="yellow">We can talk about a serious matter later.</font>

221
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,410
<font color="yellow">Do you agree?</font>

222
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,480
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

223
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,940
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Won!</font>

224
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,710
<font color="yellow">What a devious girl!</font>

225
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,580
<font color="yellow">How did you know I'm here, Mum?</font>

226
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,140
<font color="yellow">I've lived by my wits.</font>

227
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,480
<font color="yellow">You're playing in the palm of my hand.</font>

228
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,980
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that Madam Ko is on a trip abroad?</font>

229
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,540
<font color="yellow">Actually, I lied a little bit because...</font>

231
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,080
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be with you.</font>

232
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,110
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have lied.</font>

233
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,310
<font color="yellow">You sly girl.</font>

234
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,110
<font color="yellow">Stay right there.</font>

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,510
<font color="yellow">Today, it's the end for both of us.</font>

236
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,680
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - You devious girl.</font>

237
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,410
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this? You're scaring me.</font>

238
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,740
<font color="yellow">You are someone who can be scared...</font>

239
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,010
<font color="yellow">and you run away from home?</font>

240
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,110
<font color="yellow">I ran away because you locked me in.</font>

241
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,240
<font color="yellow">Were you locked in?</font>

242
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,180
<font color="yellow">She locked me in my room on the second floor.</font>

243
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,180
<font color="yellow">Did you really do that?</font>

244
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,510
<font color="yellow">What could I do?</font>

245
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,980
<font color="yellow">I couldn't break her legs or shave her head.</font>

246
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,080
<font color="yellow">Locking her in her room was the only thing I could do.</font>

247
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,410
<font color="yellow">Still that was too much.</font>

248
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
<font color="yellow">How can you lock in your daughter?</font>

249
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,540
<font color="yellow">Wait until I get my hands on you, sly girl!</font>

250
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,180
<font color="yellow">Today,</font>

251
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,740
<font color="yellow">you're dead!</font>

252
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,710
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

253
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

254
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,140
<font color="yellow">You devious girl.</font>

255
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,280
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

256
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
<font color="yellow">You sky girl.</font>

257
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
<font color="yellow">Watch your steps.</font>

258
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

259
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,710
<font color="yellow">Madam Ko!</font>

260
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,740
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

261
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,780
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing?</font>

262
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,780
<font color="yellow">You fell down yourself. Why are you taking it out to me?</font>

263
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,080
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. I don't care, you sly girl!</font>

264
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,040
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

265
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,610
<font color="yellow">I guess when I fell down...</font>

266
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,480
<font color="yellow">I strained my back.</font>

267
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,080
<font color="yellow">I do have a weak back.</font>

268
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
<font color="yellow">I'll carry you on my back.</font>

269
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,110
<font color="yellow">- I've never been on someone's back. - Excuse me.</font>

270
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,640
<font color="yellow">It's not your first time.</font>

271
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,310
<font color="yellow">After the year-end party last year,</font>

272
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,510
<font color="yellow">you were so drunk that you came home on Mr Kim's back.</font>

273
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,880
<font color="yellow">Shut up, you rascal.</font>

274
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that I'm heavy.</font>

275
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,440
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that you're too light.</font>

276
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,010
<font color="yellow">It's natural that you fall down running with such high heels on.</font>

277
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,640
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep wearing them when I advise you to wear low heels?</font>

278
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,840
<font color="yellow">How can you nag me?</font>

279
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have come here at this hour if it were not you.</font>

280
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,010
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,510
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

282
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,880
<font color="yellow">what's this sound?</font>

283
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
<font color="yellow">Splashing.</font>

284
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,240
<font color="yellow">Splashing.</font>

285
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
<font color="yellow">Is this the sound of the waves?</font>

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,680
<font color="yellow">Haven't you been to the sea before?</font>

287
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,240
<font color="yellow">It's the sound of the waves.</font>

288
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,840
<font color="yellow">It's so romantic.</font>

289
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,280
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because I'm here at a night sea.</font>

290
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,880
<font color="yellow">The sound of the waves seems to be louder.</font>

291
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,080
<font color="yellow">I've never felt this before.</font>

292
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,610
<font color="yellow">Shall we get closer to the sea?</font>

293
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,010
<font color="yellow">Splashing.</font>

294
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,310
<font color="yellow">Splashing.</font>

295
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,250
<font color="yellow">The sound of the waves is so romantic.</font>

296
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,940
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang must be tired. You should go back home now.</font>

297
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,280
<font color="yellow">Are you tired?</font>

298
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,250
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

299
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,910
<font color="yellow">Then let's go near to the sea.</font>

300
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,210
<font color="yellow">I want to hear them more closely.</font>

301
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,250
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

302
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,910
<font color="yellow">I love the sound of the waves.</font>

303
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,580
<font color="yellow">Mum, are you here to admire the ocean?</font>

304
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,840
<font color="yellow">No, I'm here to drag you home.</font>

305
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,280
<font color="yellow">Oh gosh, my back. Let's go.</font>

306
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,440
<font color="yellow">Where were you until this late hour?</font>

307
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,010
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

308
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,250
<font color="yellow">She was worried about upsetting you, so she left before dinner.</font>

309
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,180
<font color="yellow">I do understand how you feel,</font>

310
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,480
<font color="yellow">but she has changed a lot.</font>

311
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,310
<font color="yellow">She's totally different from how she used to be.</font>

312
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,180
<font color="yellow">She said that she divorced you out of anger...</font>

313
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,480
<font color="yellow">but has been deeply regretting her decision.</font>

314
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,910
<font color="yellow">She realised that you were the only one on her side...</font>

315
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,010
<font color="yellow">and that she should have been more thoughtful.</font>

316
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,580
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past. Let's not talk about it, Mum.</font>

317
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,310
<font color="yellow">It'd be much better for him to go back to his ex-wife...</font>

318
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,140
<font color="yellow">than finding someone new to be with.</font>

319
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,810
<font color="yellow">I must have made you uneasy,</font>

320
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,510
<font color="yellow">but I felt comfortable and warm as if I have...</font>

321
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,710
<font color="yellow">finally come home after being away for a long time.</font>

322
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,710
<font color="yellow">Both of your parents...</font>

323
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,110
<font color="yellow">are such wonderful people. Why did I break their hearts?</font>

324
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,610
<font color="yellow">Why couldn't I trust you and be there for you?</font>

325
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,680
<font color="yellow">I regret everything and wish I did things differently.</font>

326
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,780
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what a coincidence.</font>

327
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,750
<font color="yellow">I mean, Seoul is a big city.</font>

328
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,580
<font color="yellow">How can she move to this neighbourhood?</font>

329
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,310
<font color="yellow">Young Eun...</font>

330
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,180
<font color="yellow">looked exactly like before. Will she recognise me?</font>

331
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I should pump up...</font>

332
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,710
<font color="yellow">- Are you working out or what? - My gosh.</font>

333
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,180
<font color="yellow">No. I haven't been able to work out recently,</font>

334
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,580
<font color="yellow">so I was just checking to see if my muscles have shrunk.</font>

335
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,910
<font color="yellow">Move over.</font>

336
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,040
<font color="yellow">Stop checking your muscles...</font>

337
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,780
<font color="yellow">and pay attention to your wife.</font>

338
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,610
<font color="yellow">Ask me if anything is bothering me...</font>

339
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,910
<font color="yellow">or whether I'm feeling well or not.</font>

340
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,580
<font color="yellow">You're so healthy.</font>

341
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,540
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I have many health issues.</font>

342
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,610
<font color="yellow">That's why having a chilled and positive attitude is important.</font>

343
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,710
<font color="yellow">You get so worked up over the littlest things...</font>

344
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,780
<font color="yellow">and lose your temper. That's why your head...</font>

345
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,810
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

346
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,040
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - What is it?</font>

347
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,440
<font color="yellow">I asked you to dry clean this navy suit. Why is it here?</font>

348
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,840
<font color="yellow">Is it? I forgot. I'll drop it off tomorrow.</font>

349
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how can you forget to do that?</font>

350
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,780
<font color="yellow">Well, you have many suits.</font>

351
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,110
<font color="yellow">Just wear anything. Why are you being so picky?</font>

352
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,440
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this suit...</font>

353
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,940
<font color="yellow">It suits me the best. It fits me so well.</font>

354
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,910
<font color="yellow">I was going to wear it tomorrow. Goodness.</font>

355
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,080
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you going somewhere special tomorrow?</font>

356
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,280
<font color="yellow">What? No, why do you ask?</font>

357
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,580
<font color="yellow">Then why do you have to wear that navy suit?</font>

358
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,080
<font color="yellow">Well... We might have some...</font>

359
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,410
<font color="yellow">VIP customers coming to the shop tomorrow, so I wanted to wear it.</font>

360
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,640
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

361
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,750
<font color="yellow">Turn off the light. I'm going to sleep.</font>

362
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,510
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

363
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,480
<font color="yellow">I'm exhausted.</font>

364
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,610
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I met Young Eun again.</font>

365
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,880
<font color="yellow">Am I dreaming?</font>

366
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,110
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? It's cold outside.</font>

367
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,640
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

368
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,240
<font color="yellow">You made it through another day, Jun.</font>

369
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,610
<font color="yellow">You also worked all day long...</font>

370
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,940
<font color="yellow">and took care of your mum. Good job.</font>

371
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,440
<font color="yellow">How's Ms Choi doing by the way?</font>

372
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,710
<font color="yellow">She's all right.</font>

373
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,380
<font color="yellow">She must really hate me.</font>

374
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,610
<font color="yellow">Don't be discouraged. You have to just face it and be direct with her.</font>

375
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,940
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't get discouraged.</font>

376
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,110
<font color="yellow">Dad and Mum, Jun is home from work.</font>

377
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,510
<font color="yellow">I'm home, Ms Choi and Mr Lee!</font>

378
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

379
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,240
<font color="yellow">Why is he reporting to us that he's back from work?</font>

380
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,580
<font color="yellow">Is he trying to act like our son-in-law or what?</font>

381
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,310
<font color="yellow">Just leave him.</font>

382
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,910
<font color="yellow">You must be tired. Go get some rest.</font>

383
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mr Lee.</font>

384
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,640
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi. I hope you have a good night, too.</font>

385
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,940
<font color="yellow">Why does he even care?</font>

386
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,310
<font color="yellow">Stop giving them a hard time and just approve of him now.</font>

387
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,680
<font color="yellow">If you think about it, he's more than what we can ask for.</font>

388
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,980
<font color="yellow">He has never been married before,</font>

389
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,710
<font color="yellow">whereas Dong Sook has been divorced twice.</font>

390
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,310
<font color="yellow">She also has Da Jeong, too.</font>

391
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,880
<font color="yellow">It's not easy for a bachelor to marry a divorcee.</font>

392
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,710
<font color="yellow">I think he's broad-minded.</font>

393
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,940
<font color="yellow">This soup is delicious.</font>

394
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,610
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

395
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,580
<font color="yellow">I'll debone this for you.</font>

396
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,440
<font color="yellow">Is Da Jeong not back from work yet?</font>

397
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,440
<font color="yellow">She called me from the bus stop earlier.</font>

398
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,610
<font color="yellow">Where are you going in the middle of dinner?</font>

399
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wait for her outside.</font>

400
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,610
<font color="yellow">It's late now. What if something happens to her?</font>

401
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,440
<font color="yellow">Her co-worker also lives in the area, so you don't need to worry.</font>

402
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,410
<font color="yellow">Even so, it's dangerous to walk around this late.</font>

403
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,840
<font color="yellow">- I'm home. - Hey, Da Jeong.</font>

404
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,880
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

405
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,180
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Hi.</font>

406
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,780
<font color="yellow">You're home safe and sound.</font>

407
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

408
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,810
<font color="yellow">Jun has been worried about you...</font>

409
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,110
<font color="yellow">because it can be dangerous at night.</font>

410
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,640
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

411
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,510
<font color="yellow">Welcome home. Have you had dinner yet?</font>

412
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,240
<font color="yellow">We had so many customers today.</font>

413
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,910
<font color="yellow">I just ate some bread and milk.</font>

414
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,680
<font color="yellow">That's not enough. You have to eat a proper meal.</font>

415
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,310
<font color="yellow">I'll bring rice and soup for you. You should eat a little bit.</font>

416
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,010
<font color="yellow">Gosh, the fish is well grilled.</font>

417
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,780
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.</font>

418
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,680
<font color="yellow">Jun can be so sweet.</font>

419
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,640
<font color="yellow">Here it comes.</font>

420
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,380
<font color="yellow">- All right. - Eat up.</font>

421
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,740
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - No problem.</font>

422
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,310
<font color="yellow">- Here. Eat this. - Okay.</font>

423
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,610
<font color="yellow">- Jun. You, too. - This is so good.</font>

424
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,510
<font color="yellow">The fish tastes perfect.</font>

425
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,910
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang.</font>

426
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,240
<font color="yellow">You kidnapped Hyo Won on purpose, didn't you?</font>

427
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't kidnap her.</font>

428
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,410
<font color="yellow">That's not true at all.</font>

429
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,280
<font color="yellow">Then why did you ignore my calls?</font>

430
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,880
<font color="yellow">I called you so many times.</font>

431
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,010
<font color="yellow">You called me?</font>

432
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,010
<font color="yellow">I didn't get any calls from you.</font>

433
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,640
<font color="yellow">I marked every phone number you can call from...</font>

434
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,640
<font color="yellow">as spam.</font>

435
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

436
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,540
<font color="yellow">Aren't I so meticulous?</font>

437
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that brat.</font>

438
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,240
<font color="yellow">Why on earth did you guys come here?</font>

439
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,080
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang's mum hurt her leg, so he had to visit her.</font>

440
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,140
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

441
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,480
<font color="yellow">Are you her daughter-in-law?</font>

442
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,710
<font color="yellow">What does his mum's injury have to do with you?</font>

443
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

444
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,180
<font color="yellow">I couldn't keep the promise I made to you.</font>

445
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,980
<font color="yellow">I told you not to worry because I'm not interested in Hyo Won,</font>

446
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,680
<font color="yellow">but I have fallen for her.</font>

447
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm in pain.</font>

448
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,380
<font color="yellow">- What did you just say? - A little while ago,</font>

449
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,610
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang told me that he has feelings for me, too.</font>

450
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,610
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

451
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,840
<font color="yellow">You told me not to worry saying that you're not interested.</font>

452
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,380
<font color="yellow">How can you stab me in the back like this?</font>

453
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,740
<font color="yellow">You jerk. You must have planned all of this from the get-go.</font>

454
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,540
<font color="yellow">Stop talking to him disrespectfully.</font>

455
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
<font color="yellow">Mother will hear you.</font>

456
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you swearing?</font>

457
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,780
<font color="yellow">- Mother? - Tae Yang's mum.</font>

458
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,840
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you two.</font>

459
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,480
<font color="yellow">Leave us alone for a moment.</font>

460
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,440
<font color="yellow">I want to have a word with Hyo Won.</font>

461
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,910
<font color="yellow">You're not...</font>

462
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,240
<font color="yellow">going to hit her, right?</font>

463
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,780
<font color="yellow">Who do you think I am?</font>

464
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,680
<font color="yellow">I'm not a violent person.</font>

465
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,680
<font color="yellow">Call me if something happens.</font>

466
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,110
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting outside.</font>

467
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,640
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me.</font>

468
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,810
<font color="yellow">How far did you go with him?</font>

469
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,740
<font color="yellow">How far...</font>

470
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,740
<font color="yellow">did you go with Kang Tae Yang?</font>

471
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,240
<font color="yellow">We went all the way.</font>

472
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,080
<font color="yellow">You went all the way?</font>

473
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,280
<font color="yellow">How can you be so shameless?</font>

474
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,040
<font color="yellow">You went all the way?</font>

475
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,110
<font color="yellow">How can you say that in front of your mother?</font>

476
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,640
<font color="yellow">You were the one who asked me.</font>

477
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,580
<font color="yellow">You're so shameless.</font>

478
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
<font color="yellow">So allow us to see each other.</font>

479
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,880
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

480
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,640
<font color="yellow">- there's no going back. - My goodness.</font>

481
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

482
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,240
<font color="yellow">Do you have...</font>

483
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,240
<font color="yellow">any idea...</font>

484
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,080
<font color="yellow">how I raised you?</font>

485
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,010
<font color="yellow">Do you know how cautious I was?</font>

486
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,180
<font color="yellow">How can you fall in love...</font>

487
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,140
<font color="yellow">with someone from lowly background? You darn wench.</font>

488
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,410
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

489
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

490
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,610
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

491
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,840
<font color="yellow">Quiet down. She'll hear you.</font>

492
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,310
<font color="yellow">I can't live like this.</font>

493
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,380
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - What's going on in there?</font>

494
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,410
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Don't worry about it, Mother.</font>

495
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,910
<font color="yellow">I can hear her crying.</font>

496
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,010
<font color="yellow">My mom is just a very emotional person.</font>

497
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,710
<font color="yellow">Don't mind her at all.</font>

498
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji Yun.</font>

499
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,610
<font color="yellow">- I'm calling with worries. - About what?</font>

500
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,940
<font color="yellow">About Hyo Won.</font>

501
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,010
<font color="yellow">Did she return home?</font>

502
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

503
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,540
<font color="yellow">- Oh, gosh. - Why did you have to...</font>

504
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,180
<font color="yellow">go out of your way and worsen the situation?</font>

505
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,240
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to looking out for Hyo Won.</font>

506
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,840
<font color="yellow">That man Hyo Won is seeing...</font>

507
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,910
<font color="yellow">Is he that bad?</font>

508
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,180
<font color="yellow">The two seemed to be mad in love.</font>

509
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,310
<font color="yellow">Can you persuade your mother?</font>

510
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,140
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit tired right now.</font>

511
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,810
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

512
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,810
<font color="yellow">Okay. Goodnight.</font>

513
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,910
<font color="yellow">If she finds out that that man is Kang Tae Yang,</font>

514
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,610
<font color="yellow">she'll definitely pass out.</font>

515
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Hwang.</font>

516
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,640
<font color="yellow">Can you make some time for me tomorrow?</font>

517
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,610
<font color="yellow">I want you to go somewhere with me.</font>

518
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,080
<font color="yellow">Mr Hwang, the lawyer?</font>

519
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,110
<font color="yellow">Welcome home, Honey.</font>

520
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

521
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,610
<font color="yellow">The way she called him "honey" sounded so natural.</font>

522
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,840
<font color="yellow">Aren't they strangers now after the divorce?</font>

523
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,940
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't she be disallowed to call him, "honey"?</font>

524
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,910
<font color="yellow">"Honey", my foot.</font>

525
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,040
<font color="yellow">(Mr Pretty Eyes)</font>

526
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,180
<font color="yellow">Hey, Honey.</font>

527
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,040
<font color="yellow">I must be out of my mind.</font>

528
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
<font color="yellow">Did you just...</font>

529
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,880
<font color="yellow">call me, "honey"?</font>

530
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,110
<font color="yellow">No. I can explain.</font>

531
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,210
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about something and...</font>

532
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,740
<font color="yellow">You must have really wanted to call me, "honey".</font>

533
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,380
<font color="yellow">Should we just get married...</font>

534
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,140
<font color="yellow">after my sister's wedding?</font>

535
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,940
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

536
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,510
<font color="yellow">My mind was somewhere else just now.</font>

537
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,310
<font color="yellow">Were you thinking about us getting married?</font>

538
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh. It was a mistake.</font>

539
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
<font color="yellow">Can you just forget about it?</font>

540
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,610
<font color="yellow">I can't just forget about something I heard with my own ears.</font>

541
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,810
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

542
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,740
<font color="yellow">You're grossing me out.</font>

543
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,010
<font color="yellow">Look at you being all shy.</font>

544
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,240
<font color="yellow">I know you want me to call you that.</font>

545
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,880
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

546
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,740
<font color="yellow">I read on the Internet that...</font>

547
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,610
<font color="yellow">many dating couples call each other that these days.</font>

548
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,980
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

549
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,440
<font color="yellow">you've been promoted from Ms Shiny Eyes to Honey.</font>

550
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,780
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

551
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,740
<font color="yellow">Let's hang up if you're going to keep talking nonsense.</font>

552
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,480
<font color="yellow">Fine. Goodnight, then.</font>

553
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,180
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Gosh.</font>

554
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,310
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

555
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,110
<font color="yellow">Please get a grip, Na Yun Shil.</font>

556
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,910
<font color="yellow">How could you call him that?</font>

557
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,910
<font color="yellow">I should have gone back home even at the late hour.</font>

558
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,610
<font color="yellow">It's too late now.</font>

559
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,310
<font color="yellow">And you said your back was hurting.</font>

560
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,180
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep.</font>

561
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,240
<font color="yellow">By the way, what is that awful smell?</font>

562
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,840
<font color="yellow">It's the fermented soybean lump.</font>

563
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,410
<font color="yellow">I like the savory smell.</font>

564
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,110
<font color="yellow">Does your love for Kang Tae Yang...</font>

565
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,040
<font color="yellow">make this smell savory to you?</font>

566
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,640
<font color="yellow">The power of love is astonishing.</font>

567
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,210
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

568
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,580
<font color="yellow">what do you like about Kang Tae Yang so much?</font>

569
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,940
<font color="yellow">What did you like about Dad?</font>

570
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,940
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

571
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,580
<font color="yellow">It's hard to answer, right?</font>

572
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,810
<font color="yellow">Ever since I was young,</font>

573
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,180
<font color="yellow">I grew up hearing bad things about you.</font>

574
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,980
<font color="yellow">- That you married him for money. - How dare they say such a thing?</font>

575
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,310
<font color="yellow">- Who said that? - Nobody says that in your face.</font>

576
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,240
<font color="yellow">They'd say it behind your back.</font>

577
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,040
<font color="yellow">And I didn't need them to say so. I could just see from their faces.</font>

578
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,080
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

579
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,040
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

580
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,710
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

581
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,310
<font color="yellow">I'd find myself true love,</font>

582
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,840
<font color="yellow">have a happy relationship...</font>

583
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,310
<font color="yellow">and get married.</font>

584
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,140
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

585
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,040
<font color="yellow">Everyone I met was interested in either my background...</font>

586
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,380
<font color="yellow">or they rejected me talking ill of you.</font>

587
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,480
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can stop being your daughter...</font>

588
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,910
<font color="yellow">and I can't stop being the youngest daughter of Meesa Apparel, too.</font>

589
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,580
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted...</font>

590
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,310
<font color="yellow">someone who can see me...</font>

591
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,240
<font color="yellow">as who I am.</font>

592
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,180
<font color="yellow">And that person is Kang Tae Yang?</font>

593
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,010
<font color="yellow">Yes. I knew he could do that from the start.</font>

594
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,510
<font color="yellow">When I got to know him better,</font>

595
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,540
<font color="yellow">he was even better than what I was looking for.</font>

596
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,210
<font color="yellow">I can count on him...</font>

597
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,810
<font color="yellow">to find what I've been looking for...</font>

598
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,040
<font color="yellow">in my whole life.</font>

599
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,110
<font color="yellow">You've only known him for a short while.</font>

600
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,210
<font color="yellow">I just want you...</font>

601
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,440
<font color="yellow">to stop being so negative...</font>

602
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,740
<font color="yellow">and see him as who he really is.</font>

603
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,480
<font color="yellow">I thought you were just an immature troublemaker.</font>

604
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,480
<font color="yellow">Looks like I was wrong.</font>

605
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,610
<font color="yellow">It's chilly out there.</font>

606
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,510
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

607
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
<font color="yellow">Where are my shoes?</font>

608
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,150
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

609
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,610
<font color="yellow">I noticed that you and Hyo Won's shoes have gotten dirty,</font>

610
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,110
<font color="yellow">so I washed and dried them.</font>

611
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,510
<font color="yellow">- Where's your mother? - She's sleeping in the other room.</font>

612
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,650
<font color="yellow">She spoke ill of me for being senseless, didn't she?</font>

613
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,940
<font color="yellow">No, she's not the kind of person to speak ill of anyone.</font>

614
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,480
<font color="yellow">What? Then what about me?</font>

615
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,210
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that I'm that kind of person?</font>

616
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,510
<font color="yellow">That is in no way of what I meant.</font>

617
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,880
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry?</font>

618
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,240
<font color="yellow">I haven't eaten at all today worrying about Hyo Won.</font>

619
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,680
<font color="yellow">I'm famished.</font>

620
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,710
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to cook you up something?</font>

621
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,210
<font color="yellow">You?</font>

622
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,710
<font color="yellow">I don't know whether you'll like it or not.</font>

623
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,880
<font color="yellow">That's so good.</font>

624
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,710
<font color="yellow">What is this called?</font>

625
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,580
<font color="yellow">It's salted rockfish soup, a winter specialty.</font>

626
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,650
<font color="yellow">The soup tastes delicious.</font>

627
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,780
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

628
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,610
<font color="yellow">your mum is a very good cook.</font>

629
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,010
<font color="yellow">The fish melts in my mouth.</font>

630
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,280
<font color="yellow">It's so tasty.</font>

631
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,040
<font color="yellow">Would you like some?</font>

632
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

633
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,210
<font color="yellow">Just one shot, then.</font>

634
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,710
<font color="yellow">That was just amazing.</font>

635
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,680
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won drank half the vat earlier today.</font>

636
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,880
<font color="yellow">That crazy brat.</font>

637
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,240
<font color="yellow">Can you give me just one more shot?</font>

638
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,080
<font color="yellow">The alcohol's warming me up and I feel much better.</font>

639
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,680
<font color="yellow">Just one more shot.</font>

640
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,110
<font color="yellow">Thank you for cooking breakfast.</font>

641
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,540
<font color="yellow">Let's eat, everyone.</font>

642
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,410
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

643
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,440
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

644
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,840
<font color="yellow">You started already.</font>

645
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,150
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

646
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,840
<font color="yellow">I invited him to join us for breakfast.</font>

647
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,150
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

648
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,010
<font color="yellow">I'll get his soup and rice.</font>

649
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,180
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Have a seat, Jun.</font>

650
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,380
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

651
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,580
<font color="yellow">You all seem to think that ganging up against me...</font>

652
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,540
<font color="yellow">will make me give in.</font>

653
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,740
<font color="yellow">I'm not a pushover.</font>

654
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,940
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Thanks.</font>

655
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,840
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

656
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

657
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,240
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the food.</font>

658
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,310
<font color="yellow">The egg roll looks very appetising.</font>

659
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,210
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Father.</font>

660
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,280
<font color="yellow">Would you like some bean sprouts?</font>

661
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,650
<font color="yellow">He saved you from embarrassment so take the hint and stop it.</font>

662
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,110
<font color="yellow">Can't you be nice to him while he's eating?</font>

663
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,710
<font color="yellow">He might have indigestion.</font>

664
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,650
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

665
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,810
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You can take the call.</font>

666
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,780
<font color="yellow">I don't know this number.</font>

667
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,210
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

668
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,240
<font color="yellow">Are you Sung Jun who won KBC's Best Rookie of the Year Award...</font>

669
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,710
<font color="yellow">back in 2000?</font>

670
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm that Sung Jun.</font>

671
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,240
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Bong Soo, the producer of "Music Stage".</font>

672
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,280
<font color="yellow">I called to ask you to come on our show.</font>

673
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,980
<font color="yellow">KBC's "Music Stage"?</font>

674
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,240
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to be really famous to appear on that show?</font>

675
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,410
<font color="yellow">I heard you went from singing ballads to trot songs...</font>

676
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,040
<font color="yellow">and thought your old fans would like to see how you're doing.</font>

677
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,240
<font color="yellow">We'll tape the show next Thursday. Are you free?</font>

678
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,880
<font color="yellow">Thursday?</font>

679
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm free, of course I'm free.</font>

680
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir, I understand.</font>

681
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,280
<font color="yellow">I'll see you, then. Thank you.</font>

682
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,480
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

683
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,080
<font color="yellow">They want me to appear on KBC's "Music Stage".</font>

684
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,310
<font color="yellow">That was the producer of the show.</font>

685
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,040
<font color="yellow">"Music Stage"?</font>

686
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,110
<font color="yellow">You have to be quite good to be on that show.</font>

687
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,480
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mum.</font>

688
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,440
<font color="yellow">Jun won the Best Rookie of the Year Award at KBC's...</font>

689
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,740
<font color="yellow">year-end award ceremony in 2000.</font>

690
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,980
<font color="yellow">Did you actually...</font>

691
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,180
<font color="yellow">win an award, then?</font>

692
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,980
<font color="yellow">It's true, Mum.</font>

693
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,310
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung was a really famous singer at one time.</font>

694
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,080
<font color="yellow">If Dong Jin says so, then it must be true.</font>

695
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,310
<font color="yellow">I thought you were just a poor musician.</font>

696
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,510
<font color="yellow">I guess I was wrong.</font>

697
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,910
<font color="yellow">He's in a slump, but he'll rise again soon.</font>

698
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,680
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry.</font>

699
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,650
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

700
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,880
<font color="yellow">- Thanks a lot. - For what?</font>

701
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,780
<font color="yellow">For siding with me at breakfast.</font>

702
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,040
<font color="yellow">I wasn't taking sides. I just told the truth.</font>

703
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,910
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget what you did.</font>

704
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,440
<font color="yellow">If your mum disapproves of you and Yun Shil,</font>

705
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,740
<font color="yellow">then I'll take a stand and...</font>

706
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,740
<font color="yellow">Will you watch your tongue? We're right outside the gate.</font>

707
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,780
<font color="yellow">You're right, sorry. I'll be careful next time.</font>

708
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,310
<font color="yellow">Ddong Jin, it seems that...</font>

709
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,110
<font color="yellow">your ex-wife isn't over you yet.</font>

710
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,280
<font color="yellow">You need to make things very clear to everyone involved.</font>

711
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,810
<font color="yellow">One small mistake...</font>

712
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,710
<font color="yellow">could end up in you hurting Yun Shil badly.</font>

713
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,180
<font color="yellow">You're in no position to give me dating advice.</font>

714
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,580
<font color="yellow">Focus on your own relationship.</font>

715
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,410
<font color="yellow">That sounded like you mean we're family now.</font>

716
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,040
<font color="yellow">That was nothing. I'm off to work.</font>

717
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,680
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

718
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,510
<font color="yellow">Have a nice day.</font>

719
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,140
<font color="yellow">If Ddong Jin takes my side,</font>

720
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,180
<font color="yellow">then his mum is practically in the bag.</font>

721
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,740
<font color="yellow">This is it.</font>

722
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,880
<font color="yellow">Sung Tae Pyung's life is about to get much better.</font>

723
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,680
<font color="yellow">May the force of the universe be with me always.</font>

724
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,310
<font color="yellow">This is a bit to garish.</font>

725
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,180
<font color="yellow">This looks gentlemanly, but too stern.</font>

726
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,240
<font color="yellow">I can't make up my mind.</font>

727
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,480
<font color="yellow">Honey, help me out.</font>

728
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,840
<font color="yellow">Which of these ties should I wear?</font>

729
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,980
<font color="yellow">Wear whichever one you want. Why do you care how you look?</font>

730
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,910
<font color="yellow">We might get a VIP client today.</font>

731
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,440
<font color="yellow">I want to look well-dressed.</font>

732
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,440
<font color="yellow">I like this gentlemanly one.</font>

733
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,680
<font color="yellow">This one? Okay.</font>

734
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,210
<font color="yellow">- Are you wearing cologne? - What?</font>

735
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, in case the suit smells...</font>

736
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,780
<font color="yellow">because you didn't have it dry-cleaned.</font>

737
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,310
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you just wear another suit? You're so particular.</font>

738
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,410
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work already?</font>

739
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,510
<font color="yellow">Yes. We got a huge pre-order so I have to go in early.</font>

740
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,710
<font color="yellow">I'll walk you out.</font>

741
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,480
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

742
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,880
<font color="yellow">What? Don't you want to walk me to work?</font>

743
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,010
<font color="yellow">Did I say that? Don't get imaginative.</font>

744
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,180
<font color="yellow">Come on out.</font>

745
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,280
<font color="yellow">She just ruined it.</font>

746
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,110
<font color="yellow">What if we meet Young Eun?</font>

747
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,610
<font color="yellow">Why are you walking so slowly?</font>

748
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,510
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go ahead? I'll...</font>

749
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,140
<font color="yellow">I'll take a slow stroll while I enjoy the view.</font>

750
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,780
<font color="yellow">What's there to see? We take this route every day.</font>

751
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,440
<font color="yellow">Even if we do,</font>

752
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,480
<font color="yellow">the view can be different each morning.</font>

753
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,440
<font color="yellow">I want to take a slow walk.</font>

754
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,310
<font color="yellow">You've been acting strangely.</font>

755
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,980
<font color="yellow">How so?</font>

756
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,740
<font color="yellow">You snuck out last night.</font>

757
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,310
<font color="yellow">And now you're walking a few steps behind me.</font>

758
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,510
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

759
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,140
<font color="yellow">vouch for another loan?</font>

760
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,410
<font color="yellow">Is that what you think?</font>

761
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,780
<font color="yellow">If I ever help someone take out a loan, I'll change my surname.</font>

762
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,940
<font color="yellow">I'll never do that again.</font>

763
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,780
<font color="yellow">That was just a small test.</font>

764
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,910
<font color="yellow">I'm glad it's not that.</font>

765
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,840
<font color="yellow">You go this way.</font>

766
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,780
<font color="yellow">I'll go that way.</font>

767
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780

00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,610
<font color="yellow">Let's just forget about it.</font>

835
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,640

<font color="yellow">or something like this could happen again.</font>

837
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
<font color="yellow">We'll install security cameras by the end of the day.</font>

838
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,410
<font color="yellow">If this happens again, we'll report to the police.</font>

839
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:07,940
<font color="yellow">Anyone there?</font>

840
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,380
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

841
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

842
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,980
<font color="yellow">Please send your mother my regards.</font>

843
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,440
<font color="yellow">She probably didn't even sleep very well...</font>

844
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,040
<font color="yellow">with us sleeping in the bedroom.</font>

845
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,480
<font color="yellow">You embarrassed me so much.</font>

846
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,240
<font color="yellow">What would you be embarrassed about?</font>

847
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,110
<font color="yellow">Did you forget how loud you cried?</font>

848
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:35,010
<font color="yellow">What about your drinking habits?</font>

849
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,310
<font color="yellow">What kind of impression do you think you left?</font>

850
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,310
<font color="yellow">What drinking habits?</font>

851
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,310
<font color="yellow">I only had two glasses of plum wine.</font>

852

854
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,810
<font color="yellow">Nothing out of the ordinary except when you cried and sang.</font>

00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,280
<font color="yellow">Did you brainwash her?</font>

868
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,940
<font color="yellow">How could you make her kick her only brother?</font>

869
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,240
<font color="yellow">- You punched him first. - What did you say?</font>

870
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,640
<font color="yellow">Stop it already!</font>

871
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,910
<font color="yellow">Shut it!</font>

872
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,010

875
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,540
<font color="yellow">Can you knock some sense into her, Mum?</font>

876
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,910

883
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
<font color="yellow">It's not like all dating couples end up marrying.</font>

884
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,380
<font color="yellow">They might break up mid-way.</font>

885
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,840
<font color="yellow">So let's see how it goes.</font>

886
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,810
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

887
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,710
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to break them up, not encourage them.</font>

888
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,240
<font color="yellow">You're matching someone like him with Hyo Won?</font>

889
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,540
<font color="yellow">If this is how you're going to be,</font>

890
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,510
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to live here any longer.</font>

891
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of everything.</font>

892
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,040
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

893
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,580
<font color="yellow">You can date Choi Ji Yun.</font>

894
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,110
<font color="yellow">Are you satisfied?</font>

895
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,840
<font color="yellow">I have a conference meeting with Jeil Department Store.</font>

896
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,880
<font color="yellow">Okay. Are our suits...</font>

897
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,380
<font color="yellow">really going to be sold at the department store?</font>

898
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,480
<font color="yellow">We'll have to see about that.</font>

899
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,880
<font color="yellow">What's there to see? I'm sure you'll get it done.</font>

900
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,480
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the bathroom.</font>

901
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,480
<font color="yellow">I'll go check on how the glass replacement is going.</font>

902
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,440
<font color="yellow">Go on, then.</font>

903
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,580
<font color="yellow">If only my honey would just give me a kiss on the cheek,</font>

904
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,780
<font color="yellow">I think the conference meeting will go very well.</font>

905
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,610
<font color="yellow">They might hear us.</font>

906
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,110
<font color="yellow">Who? We're the only ones here.</font>

907
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,380
<font color="yellow">Good luck on your meeting.</font>

908
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,380
<font color="yellow">I'm all charged up.</font>

909
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,610
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

910
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,440
<font color="yellow">This brings back memories of the times...</font>

911
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,480
<font color="yellow">when you were the Deputy CEO of Meesa Apparel.</font>

912
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,080
<font color="yellow">I'm no longer the Deputy CEO of Meesa Apparel.</font>

913
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,210
<font color="yellow">I'm here to represent Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

914
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,310
<font color="yellow">I appreciate you seeing me.</font>

915
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:46,510
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

916
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,410
<font color="yellow">We went over your proposal.</font>

917
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,640
<font color="yellow">But everyday customers...</font>

918
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,210
<font color="yellow">aren't very familiar with Bespoke Suits.</font>

919
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,810
<font color="yellow">I wanted to hear your insights...</font>

920
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,010
<font color="yellow">on how we're going to make profit.</font>

921
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:04,780
<font color="yellow">Firstly,</font>

922
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,980
<font color="yellow">we should diversify the suits according to the price range.</font>

923
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,210
<font color="yellow">It should raise the brand awareness.</font>

924
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,610
<font color="yellow">After we stabilize,</font>

925
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,240
<font color="yellow">we'll work towards getting recognition as a premium brand...</font>

926
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,810
<font color="yellow">targeting VIP customers.</font>

927
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,610
<font color="yellow">That's my market strategy.</font>

928
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,380
<font color="yellow">With Wolgyesu Tailor Shop being part of the department store,</font>

929
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,610
<font color="yellow">it'll be a new paradigm...</font>

930
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,410
<font color="yellow">of the composition of men's wear department.</font>

931
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,880
<font color="yellow">It'll aid the department store with diversity...</font>

932
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,610
<font color="yellow">and improvement in quality.</font>

933
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,980
<font color="yellow">The sales of our newly launched outdoor brand is looking alarming.</font>

934
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,210
<font color="yellow">We are still at the early stage of launching,</font>

935
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,240
<font color="yellow">but the performance is below our expectations.</font>

936
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,140
<font color="yellow">We're not doing good on consumer recognition either.</font>

937
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,740
<font color="yellow">There hasn't been improvement shown in brand awareness.</font>

938
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,280
<font color="yellow">The outdoor wear market...</font>

939
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,840
<font color="yellow">was already a red ocean when we went into business.</font>

940
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:56,140
<font color="yellow">We see that as the main cause of our failure.</font>

941
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,440
<font color="yellow">We should adopt more aggressive marketing strategies...</font>

942
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,010
<font color="yellow">to raise brand awareness.</font>

943
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,710
<font color="yellow">It's somewhat too early to say,</font>

944
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,580
<font color="yellow">but we might have to declare loss cut.</font>

945
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,210
<font color="yellow">It's time for us to make a decision.</font>

946
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,580
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

947
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,540
<font color="yellow">Can you tell me...</font>

948
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,210
<font color="yellow">what have the marking team been up to...</font>

949
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,480
<font color="yellow">with all the promotional spending?</font>

950
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,440
<font color="yellow">Is this the best you can do even with mobilizing...</font>

951
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,280
<font color="yellow">Meesa Apparel's local distributors?</font>

952
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,480
<font color="yellow">It might sound like an excuse,</font>

953
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,980
<font color="yellow">but we weren't able to fully utilize our technology...</font>

954
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,740
<font color="yellow">with outdoor wears' nature of...</font>

955
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,410
<font color="yellow">having to be functional and efficient.</font>

956
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,310
<font color="yellow">We overlooked the fact that...</font>

957
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:37,410
<font color="yellow">the market adopted a trend of athleisure wears.</font>

958
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,980
<font color="yellow">We see that as the main cause of our failure.</font>

959
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,610
<font color="yellow">Is that all you're capable of?</font>

960
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,310
<font color="yellow">All you do is make excuses.</font>

961
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,880
<font color="yellow">Not a single one of you can come up with a countermeasure.</font>

962
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,280
<font color="yellow">If you don't show me a result, in marketing or product development,</font>

963
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,540
<font color="yellow">I'll fire all of you.</font>

964
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:57,740
<font color="yellow">Consider yourself informed, okay?</font>

965
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying this just to scare you.</font>

966
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,840
<font color="yellow">Here's your order.</font>

967
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,410
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

968
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,940
<font color="yellow">What should I have today?</font>

969
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,640
<font color="yellow">I'll have a bulgogi burger and orange juice.</font>

970
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,940
<font color="yellow">You don't need to increase our sales. Stay with your mother.</font>

971
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,880
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll stick around only for a bit.</font>

972
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,880
<font color="yellow">There's a new menu. Do you want to try that?</font>

973
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,310
<font color="yellow">Is it? Okay, I'll try that.</font>

974
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,910
<font color="yellow">Whatever you recommend.</font>

975
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,740
<font color="yellow">I'll help you pay for your order.</font>

976
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,810
<font color="yellow">I didn't think my mum would give in so soon.</font>

977
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,240
<font color="yellow">You have a way of moving a person's heart.</font>

978
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,080
<font color="yellow">My mum must have fallen for your charms.</font>

979
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,440
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's me she likes?</font>

980
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,310
<font color="yellow">She gave in out of worry for you.</font>

981
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,510
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

982
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,580
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

983
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,840
<font color="yellow">(Pooper)</font>

984
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,880
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me, Min Hyo Won.</font>

985
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,240
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, are you back home?</font>

986
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,210
<font color="yellow">Yes. I decided to come home this morning.</font>

987
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,740
<font color="yellow">Your brother told me off for letting you out.</font>

988
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,710
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, Poop...</font>

989
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,180
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, Ji Yun, everything worked out.</font>

990
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,440
<font color="yellow">My mum just gave her approval that I can date my boyfriend, too.</font>

991
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,540
<font color="yellow">That's great. Congratulations.</font>

992
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll treat you one day.</font>

993
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,480
<font color="yellow">You, I, Hyo Sang and my boyfriend can have dinner together.</font>

994
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,610
<font color="yellow">Work hard.</font>

995
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,240
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

996
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,580
<font color="yellow">The coat should come down to...</font>

997
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,910
<font color="yellow">about here. What do you think?</font>

998
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,310
<font color="yellow">I'd like that.</font>

999
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,680
<font color="yellow">Ms Na, 145, please.</font>

1000
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,840
<font color="yellow">I took all your measurements.</font>

1001
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,710
<font color="yellow">Come downstairs to pick a design.</font>

1002
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,380
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - And let's have some tea, too.</font>

1003
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,310
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

1004
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,110
<font color="yellow">Hello, there. I see you changed your number.</font>

1005
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,840
<font color="yellow">I won't talk to you. I'm hanging up.</font>

1006
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,240
<font color="yellow">Did you notice the broken window?</font>

1007
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,940
<font color="yellow">That was just a warning.</font>

1008
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,840
<font color="yellow">Next time we might blow up the whole shop...</font>

1009
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,510
<font color="yellow">or your boss might lose a limb or two.</font>

1010
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,510
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm scared of your threats?</font>

1011
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,310
<font color="yellow">If you won't back down,</font>

1012
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,210
<font color="yellow">we'll have to go all the way.</font>

1013
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,880
<font color="yellow">Let's see how far you want to take this.</font>

1014
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,440
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

1015
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,140
<font color="yellow">Was it from the jerk from prison?</font>

1016
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,310
<font color="yellow">I need to go out.</font>

1017
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,310
<font color="yellow">Where to?</font>

1018
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,980
<font color="yellow">I have to go somewhere urgently.</font>

1019
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,240
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Master Bae on the way out.</font>

1020
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1021
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,640
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

1022
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,440
<font color="yellow">- Let's go inside. - Okay.</font>

1023
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,280
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Hong.</font>

1024
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,240
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

1025
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,910
<font color="yellow">I'm Hwang Gyu Seok, a lawyer.</font>

01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,110
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1034
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,640
<font color="yellow">We might be in the same boat.</font>

1035
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,980
<font color="yellow">I'd like to help you.</font>

1036
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,780
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to see your wife as soon as possible?</font>

1037
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,080
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

1038
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,140
<font color="yellow">You will get your wife back...</font>

1039
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,310
<font color="yellow">very soon.</font>

1040
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,280
<font color="yellow">I will do my best to get him paroled.</font>

1041
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,640
<font color="yellow">See what you can do.</font>

1042
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,110
<font color="yellow">I'll keep you informed.</font>

1043
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,910
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? Aren't you too good for me?</font>

1044
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

1045
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,380
<font color="yellow">I should have come to tell you sooner.</font>

1046
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,640
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I lacked the courage to do so.</font>

1047
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:48,980
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

1048
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,180
<font color="yellow">let me go.</font>

1049
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,710
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1050
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:57,610
<font color="yellow">You know that...</font>

1051
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,310
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to marry you out of love.</font>

1052
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,810
<font color="yellow">Do you want to pretend that nothing happened?</font>

1053
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,480
<font color="yellow">Do that for me.</font>

1054
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,910
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

1055
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,280
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

1056
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,810
<font color="yellow">I'm locked up here...</font>

1057
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,580
<font color="yellow">and Lee Dong Jin's with you.</font>

1058
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,740
<font color="yellow">It's not a fair game.</font>

1059
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:29,240
<font color="yellow">I'll be getting out soon. Let's do this on equal footing.</font>

1060
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:31,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1061
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,510
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd be here forever?</font>

1062
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,310
<font color="yellow">Someone offered me help and it looks like...</font>

1063
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,780
<font color="yellow">I'll be out pretty soon.</font>

1064
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,610
<font color="yellow">That should make it a fair fight.</font>

1065
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,580
<font color="yellow">Did you see your husband?</font>

1066
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,380
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

1067
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:20,540
<font color="yellow">I'm here on business.</font>

1068
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,840
<font color="yellow">Looking after your husband who's behind bars...</font>

1069
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,610
<font color="yellow">while dating another man.</font>

1070
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,380
<font color="yellow">You must be so very busy.</font>

1071
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,640
<font color="yellow">I have no time for nonsense. I'd like to get going.</font>

1072
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,180
<font color="yellow">You dumped your husband...</font>

1073
