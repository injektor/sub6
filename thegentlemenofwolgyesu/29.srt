4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,771
<font color="yellow">I heard from the boys.</font>

5
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:16,511
<font color="yellow">You must think you can play with...</font>

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,571
<font color="yellow">that naive girl and have fun while I'm in here,</font>

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,311
<font color="yellow">but if you do,</font>

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,241
<font color="yellow">you're dead.</font>

9
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,441
<font color="yellow">I know you have been forcing the relationship onto her.</font>

10
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:31,371
<font color="yellow">Please let Yun Shil go now.</font>

11
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:33,841
<font color="yellow">I didn't force anything.</font>

12
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,441
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil and I are married.</font>

13
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:38,211
<font color="yellow">That wedding was never completed,</font>

14
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,941
<font color="yellow">and your marriage is not registered.</font>

15
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:41,311
<font color="yellow">And most importantly,</font>

16
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,671
<font color="yellow">you did not gain her love.</font>

17
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,971
<font color="yellow">You know Yun Shil did not...</font>

18
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,211
<font color="yellow">considered you as her husband...</font>

19
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:52,011
<font color="yellow">even though she decided to marry you.</font>

20
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,041
<font color="yellow">Don't give me that.</font>

21
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:56,711
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up, I won't forgive you.</font>

22
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,411
<font color="yellow">I can make sure you never walk again.</font>

23
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,471
<font color="yellow">Look,</font>

24
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,441
<font color="yellow">if I was afraid of your threats, I wouldn't be here.</font>

25
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,711
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

26
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,041
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

27
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,771
<font color="yellow">love Yun Shil...</font>

28
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,181
<font color="yellow">and I came here because I want to take responsibility for that love.</font>

29
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:23,071
<font color="yellow">Please don't let your boys make Yun Shil miserable...</font>

30
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,941
<font color="yellow">any more.</font>

31
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,141
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

32
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,911
<font color="yellow">Making someone miserable and threatening...</font>

33
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:31,941
<font color="yellow">isn't love. It's violence.</font>

34
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:37,141
<font color="yellow">You should watch your words.</font>

35
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,941
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll be in here forever?</font>

36
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,971
<font color="yellow">I'll get out in a few months.</font>

37
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,811
<font color="yellow">How dare you run your mouth? How will you deal with the consequences?</font>

38
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,241
<font color="yellow">Nothing will change...</font>

39
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:47,971
<font color="yellow">even if you are released.</font>

40
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,871
<font color="yellow">You don't know me very well.</font>

41
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:55,811
<font color="yellow">I, Hong Gi Pyo,</font>

42
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,771
<font color="yellow">shouldn't be taken so lightly.</font>

43
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,971
<font color="yellow">I may kill you guys very secretly.</font>

44
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:05,471
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can make Yun Shil happy?</font>

45
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,041
<font color="yellow">She chose you...</font>

46
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,171
<font color="yellow">in order to repay you.</font>

47
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,841
<font color="yellow">Nothing will be left...</font>

48
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,241
<font color="yellow">in that kind of relationship if the debt is repaid.</font>

49
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,211
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

50
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,581
<font color="yellow">Get out of my sight.</font>

51
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,271
<font color="yellow">And let me warn you again.</font>

52
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,671
<font color="yellow">I'm not a moron who will let someone steal his wife.</font>

53
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,111
<font color="yellow">Let me repeat. Yun Shil is not your wife.</font>

54
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:25,941
<font color="yellow">Stop being stubborn.</font>

55
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,511
<font color="yellow">You might think of me as a dead person because I'm in here,</font>

56
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:34,671
<font color="yellow">but I have nothing else to lose.</font>

57
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,641
<font color="yellow">That means I have nothing to fear...</font>

58
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,741
<font color="yellow">and nothing to hold me back.</font>

59
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:44,441
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

60
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,541
<font color="yellow">I knew Yun Shil since she was young, so I know her very well.</font>

61
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,511
<font color="yellow">She can never betray me.</font>

62
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:14,811
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me.</font>

63
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,371
<font color="yellow">The line is busy.</font>

64
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:21,571
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message...</font>

65
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:27,411
<font color="yellow">Even if every woman out there changes, I never thought you would.</font>

66
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,941
<font color="yellow">How long have I been in here? A year? 10 years?</font>

67
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,671
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

68
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:33,241
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

69
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,671
<font color="yellow">That guy, the owner or something...</font>

70
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:37,941
<font color="yellow">- just came to see me. - What?</font>

71
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,941
<font color="yellow">How is someone having an affair with another man's wife so arrogant?</font>

72
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,471
<font color="yellow">I'm just speechless.</font>

73
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,171
<font color="yellow">Make some sort of an excuse.</font>

74
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,611
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

75
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:49,241
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Sorry?</font>

76
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,211
<font color="yellow">Are you apologising?</font>

77
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,171
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you like him, too?</font>

78
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,511
<font color="yellow">Is that how I should interpret?</font>

79
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,111
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

80
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,371
<font color="yellow">- That's what... - Hey!</font>

81
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,271
<font color="yellow">Quiet.</font>

82
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,811
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me? You ingrate.</font>

83
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,841
<font color="yellow">I made so many sacrifices for you.</font>

84
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:12,911
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

85
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,381
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise,</font>

86
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,511
<font color="yellow">- but there was nothing I could do. - What?</font>

87
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,111
<font color="yellow">It may sound irresponsible,</font>

88
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,541
<font color="yellow">but I didn't want...</font>

89
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:27,611
<font color="yellow">to get married.</font>

90
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:31,841
<font color="yellow">How many couples get married because they're madly in love?</font>

91
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,271
<font color="yellow">Everyone gets married like us and then they grow on each other.</font>

92
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,141
<font color="yellow">You were lonely because I wasn't there,</font>

93
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:43,471
<font color="yellow">and you fell for that jerk's ploys because you're naive.</font>

94
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,241
<font color="yellow">But to be blunt,</font>

95
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:47,971
<font color="yellow">why would someone like him love a girl like you?</font>

96
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,711
<font color="yellow">He's just having fun. He'll discard you once he's done.</font>

97
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,311
<font color="yellow">Why don't you see that, you idiot?</font>

98
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,441
<font color="yellow">Even if that were to happen,</font>

99
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,271
<font color="yellow">I won't regret it.</font>

100
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,311
<font color="yellow">You have completely lost your mind.</font>

101
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,241
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

102
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:08,111
<font color="yellow">That's all I can say.</font>

103
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:14,971
<font color="yellow">If you thought an apology would cut it,</font>

104
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,211
<font color="yellow">you were gravely mistaken.</font>

105
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,381
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll leave you guys alone?</font>

106
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,341
<font color="yellow">I'm Hong Gi Pyo!</font>

107
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,141
<font color="yellow">The day I'm released,</font>

108
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,611
<font color="yellow">I'll set fire to the tailor shop and make sure...</font>

109
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,071
<font color="yellow">Lee Dong Jin will never walks again. Got it?</font>

110
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,471
<font color="yellow">I'll keep it brief.</font>

111
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:33,841
<font color="yellow">I'll be getting out soon.</font>

112
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:36,511
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything you'll regret later.</font>

113
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,811
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Tae Pyung's suit is ready.</font>

114
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,911
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

115
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,341
<font color="yellow">Why are you so jumpy?</font>

116
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,211
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

117
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,241
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

118
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,811
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

119
00:05:58,571 --> 00:05:59,771
<font color="yellow">No, nothing.</font>

120
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:02,811
<font color="yellow">But what did you say?</font>

121
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,941
<font color="yellow">I wondered if Tae Pyung's suit was ready.</font>

122
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:08,071
<font color="yellow">If you're done sewing it, I wanted to iron it and finish it.</font>

123
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,211
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's almost done.</font>

124
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,211
<font color="yellow">I'll finish sewing the buttonholes on the sleeves and give it to you.</font>

125
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:14,841
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

126
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,941
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

127
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,811
<font color="yellow">She's as pale as a ghost.</font>

128
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,471
<font color="yellow">What's this place? Why does she come here early in the morning?</font>

129
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,911
<font color="yellow">What's this? Is Tae Yang...</font>

130
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:12,371
<font color="yellow">working here?</font>

131
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,541
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here so early? - What else?</font>

132
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,241
<font color="yellow">I came to have a morning burger.</font>

133
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:29,911
<font color="yellow">Will you eat again, after suffering like that yesterday?</font>

134
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,711
<font color="yellow">That's why I didn't have breakfast and came straight here.</font>

135
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,311
<font color="yellow">And at lunchtime, people...</font>

136
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:36,741
<font color="yellow">I mean my friends are coming.</font>

137
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:38,541
<font color="yellow">I'll raise your sales even more than yesterday.</font>

138
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:42,111
<font color="yellow">You don't need to raise our sales, so please leave.</font>

139
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,871
<font color="yellow">What? You can't kick out a customer.</font>

140
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,071
<font color="yellow">I'll tell the store manager.</font>

141
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,771
<font color="yellow">Please take my order.</font>

142
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,141
<font color="yellow">One bulgogi burger, french fries, a cola,</font>

143
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,341
<font color="yellow">a burrito and a shrimp ring.</font>

144
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:55,841
<font color="yellow">Will you eat all of that?</font>

145
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,641
<font color="yellow">Your stomach will burst.</font>

146
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,141
<font color="yellow">Its okay. I'm going to stay here all day long.</font>

147
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,441
<font color="yellow">All day?</font>

148
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,441
<font color="yellow">I have to wait until you get off work.</font>

149
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,571
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

150
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,371
<font color="yellow">should I get a job here, too?</font>

151
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:11,171
<font color="yellow">Should I work with you?</font>

152
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,011
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Just eat your burger.</font>

153
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:21,871
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

154
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,941
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

155
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:27,981
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

156
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,441

157

<font color="yellow">This is serious.</font>

158
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:47,411
<font color="yellow">Hi, son.</font>

159
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,311
<font color="yellow">Why are you letting Hyo Won do whatever she wants?</font>

160
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:51,481
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

161
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,241
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won? - Yes, Hyo Won.</font>

162
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,641
<font color="yellow">Why are you letting a clueless little kid does as she pleases?</font>

163
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,641
<font color="yellow">- What now? - Hyo Won...</font>

164
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:02,311
<font color="yellow">went to see Tae Yang early in the morning.</font>

165
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,141
<font color="yellow">I thought she was sleeping.</font>

166
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,041
<font color="yellow">Where is Tae Yang?</font>

167
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,211
<font color="yellow">He's working at a burger joint.</font>

168
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:11,011
<font color="yellow">- What? - Do you want a loser...</font>

169
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,271
<font color="yellow">who can't get a real job as your son-in-law?</font>

170
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:14,871
<font color="yellow">He's too poor...</font>

171
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,171
<font color="yellow">to afford his own place and lives in a hostel.</font>

172
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,741
<font color="yellow">- He's not good enough for Hyo Won. - Not a chance.</font>

173
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,911
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that Tae Yang, that punk,</font>

174
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:24,311
<font color="yellow">is after Hyo Won for her money.</font>

175
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,771
<font color="yellow">I asked him flat out,</font>

176
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,611
<font color="yellow">and he said he isn't interested in her.</font>

177
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,841
<font color="yellow">Seriously. You are so naive.</font>

178
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,311
<font color="yellow">Did you believe him?</font>

179
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:36,041
<font color="yellow">- It couldn't be. - No, it definitely cannot be!</font>

180
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,411
<font color="yellow">Make sure she can't see Tae Yang again.</font>

181
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,671
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:02,711

186
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,311

187

188
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,171
<font color="yellow">He seemed very angry.</font>

189
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,841

<font color="yellow">Don't think too seriously about it.</font>

193
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,011

196

<font color="yellow">Listen to what I'm about to say.</font>

197
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:43,071
<font color="yellow">Both happiness and fear come from heart.</font>

198
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,371
<font color="yellow">I learned that during the few months I've been back here.</font>

199
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:48,771
<font color="yellow">That's why in these situations,</font>

200
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,671
<font color="yellow">your heart is the most important.</font>

201

<font color="yellow">You want to be happy, don't you?</font>

202
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,311
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

203
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,071
<font color="yellow">Then think only about that.</font>

204
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,211
<font color="yellow">Everything else is what you must overcome, not fear.</font>

205
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,211
<font color="yellow">Whether it's Gi Pyo or my family,</font>

206
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,611
<font color="yellow">you can overcome it with me.</font>

<font color="yellow">You understand what I mean, don't you?</font>

208
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,471
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

209
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:13,771
<font color="yellow">That's why I went.</font>

210
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:17,011
<font color="yellow">I wanted to handle the matter with Gi Pyo first.</font>

211
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,271
<font color="yellow">- Still. - People like that...</font>

212
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,641
<font color="yellow">specialise in intimidating others.</font>

213
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,111
<font color="yellow">They aren't scary. They just scare you to fear them.</font>

214
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:28,641
<font color="yellow">Those people fear people who don't get scared and confront them.</font>

215
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,871
<font color="yellow">I'm not afraid of Gi Pyo at all.</font>

216
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,541
<font color="yellow">So you have no reason to fear him either.</font>

217
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,911
<font color="yellow">He doesn't listen to others.</font>

218
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:39,641
<font color="yellow">I'm more afraid that you'll get hurt.</font>

219
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:40,911
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

220
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:44,271
<font color="yellow">People like that are meaner to weak people.</font>

221
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,971
<font color="yellow">Of course, he'll threaten like crazy at first,</font>

222
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,241
<font color="yellow">but he'll get worn out and leave.</font>

223
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,641
<font color="yellow">I guarantee it.</font>

224
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,971
<font color="yellow">Do you really think so?</font>

225
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:57,841
<font color="yellow">Do you know why they call people like that "gangsters"?</font>

226
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:02,341
<font color="yellow">Because they don't have the guts, so they need to travel in a gang.</font>

227
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,611
<font color="yellow">If you aren't afraid and face them with confidence,</font>

228
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:08,271
<font color="yellow">they will fear you instead.</font>

229
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,811
<font color="yellow">Do you really think so?</font>

230
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,171
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

231
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,341
<font color="yellow">I bought some baked sweet potatoes.</font>

232
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,771
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

233
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:29,841
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

234
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:32,041
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll talk to him.</font>

235
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:40,841
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

236
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:52,911
<font color="yellow">I didn't see wrong just now, did I?</font>

237
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,571
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

238
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,811
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?</font>

239
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,071
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long.</font>

240
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,671
<font color="yellow">Before, it was just interest.</font>

241
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:06,741
<font color="yellow">We got close recently.</font>

242
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,871
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I missed it.</font>

243
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:13,471
<font color="yellow">I did notice there was something going on between you two,</font>

244
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:16,511
<font color="yellow">but I didn't know it had progressed this much already.</font>

245
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:21,371
<font color="yellow">I gave it serious thoughts before making my decision.</font>

246
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,211
<font color="yellow">I'd appreciate your support.</font>

247
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:26,341
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm always on your side.</font>

248
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:30,511
<font color="yellow">But once the family finds out, especially your mother,</font>

249
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,771
<font color="yellow">it may be a problem. Will you be okay?</font>

250
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,441
<font color="yellow">I'll have to face it. Mother likes Yun Shil, too.</font>

251
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,741
<font color="yellow">Naturally, Yun Shil is the purest person you'll find,</font>

252
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:41,741
<font color="yellow">and your mother acknowledges that.</font>

253
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:45,541
<font color="yellow">But I think it'll be a different story when it comes to you.</font>

254
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,971
<font color="yellow">First, I need to take care of Gi Pyo.</font>

255
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:50,741
<font color="yellow">I'll tell her afterward.</font>

256
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,911
<font color="yellow">Please help me.</font>

257
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:54,841
<font color="yellow">Sure, of course.</font>

258
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,411
<font color="yellow">But Dong Jin,</font>

259
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,171
<font color="yellow">to be honest,</font>

260
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:06,411
<font color="yellow">I'd like to tell you to stop if you can.</font>

261
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:08,541
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil's husband...</font>

262
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,471
<font color="yellow">I mean, Gi Pyo is one thing.</font>

263
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,011
<font color="yellow">There are so many mountains to climb.</font>

264
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,471
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

265
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,711
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure nothing will worry you.</font>

266
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,241
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

267
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,541
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you eating? - What?</font>

268
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:37,371
<font color="yellow">No. I'm not hungry.</font>

269
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:41,471
<font color="yellow">What are Mr Lee and Master talking about so seriously?</font>

270
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:43,071
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong with the shop?</font>

271
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:50,911
<font color="yellow">What? You met that man?</font>

272
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:53,911
<font color="yellow">Yes. I just came back from visiting him at the prison.</font>

273
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,611
<font color="yellow">You are determined this time.</font>

274
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,141
<font color="yellow">Hi guys.</font>

275
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:05,841
<font color="yellow">Please keep it a secret for now, especially from him.</font>

276
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:11,371
<font color="yellow">Why did you stop talking as soon as I walked in?</font>

277
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:14,271
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? We were just talking about the shop</font>

278
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:16,541
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll go up, then.</font>

279
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,871
<font color="yellow">I'll let you two talk.</font>

280
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:20,041
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, you're dating, aren't you?</font>

281
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,941
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

282
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:26,571
<font color="yellow">I mean, you look completely different recently.</font>

283
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:30,241
<font color="yellow">You used to always look angry and anxious.</font>

284
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:33,471
<font color="yellow">See? Now, there's a sparkle in your eyes...</font>

285
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,571
<font color="yellow">and just look at you.</font>

286
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,841
<font color="yellow">You seem moody and emotional.</font>

287
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,771
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil looks different lately, too.</font>

288
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,811
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

289
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:48,571
<font color="yellow">People always said my eyes sparkled so much.</font>

290
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,841
<font color="yellow">They called me "Mr Pretty Eyes".</font>

291
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:55,811
<font color="yellow">My eyes started to sparkle when I was three.</font>

292
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:56,941
<font color="yellow">They were always like that.</font>

293
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:59,111
<font color="yellow">You started dating when you were three?</font>

294
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:01,711
<font color="yellow">I was born this way. I had no choice.</font>

295
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,311
<font color="yellow">I'm going up.</font>

296
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,941
<font color="yellow">Okay, go up, Mr Pretty Eyes.</font>

297
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:10,711
<font color="yellow">He is naiver than I thought.</font>

298
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:12,211
<font color="yellow">I took a guess,</font>

299
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:15,141
<font color="yellow">and he pretty much admitted to dating Yun Shil.</font>

300
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,671
<font color="yellow">He did well in school, but he is...</font>

301
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,011
<font color="yellow">very naive.</font>

302
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:23,111
<font color="yellow">But you can't tell anyone, okay?</font>

303
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:24,141
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

304
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,211
<font color="yellow">But that couple won't have it easy either.</font>

305
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:31,011
<font color="yellow">Worry about yourself.</font>

306
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,171
<font color="yellow">What's going on with Dong Sook?</font>

307
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:38,341
<font color="yellow">Mr Park has made his exit,</font>

308
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:39,971
<font color="yellow">so you should march forward.</font>

309
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:43,741
<font color="yellow">You should propose and strike with confidence.</font>

310
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:46,011
<font color="yellow">I want to do that,</font>

311
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:50,911
<font color="yellow">but then I wonder if I could take care a woman for live,</font>

312
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,311
<font color="yellow">I feel very worried and scared.</font>

313
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:59,741
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, how did you propose to Sun Nyeo?</font>

314
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,341
<font color="yellow">Don't ask.</font>

315
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:04,471
<font color="yellow">It's painful.</font>

316
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,141
<font color="yellow">I used so much blood to write this,</font>

317
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,841
<font color="yellow">that I'm too dizzy to even sit straight.</font>

318
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,911
<font color="yellow">So let's make it quick.</font>

319
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,141
<font color="yellow">Is this blood?</font>

320
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,441
<font color="yellow">Not red ink?</font>

321
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,271
<font color="yellow">Don't you see this?</font>

322
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,541
<font color="yellow">Take that off.</font>

323
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,371
<font color="yellow">Why should I do that?</font>

324
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:29,341
<font color="yellow">I barely stopped the bleeding.</font>

325
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:35,271
<font color="yellow">If this is really written in your blood,</font>

326
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:37,771
<font color="yellow">I'll marry you.</font>

327
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,971
<font color="yellow">But if it's a lie,</font>

328
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:42,811
<font color="yellow">you're out from this moment on.</font>

329
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,181
<font color="yellow">I... I really did write it.</font>

330
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,441
<font color="yellow">This is your blood, is that it?</font>

331
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,911
<font color="yellow">There's no wound.</font>

332
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,241
<font color="yellow">All you ever do is lie.</font>

333
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,341
<font color="yellow">How dare a young kid talk about writing in blood?</font>

334
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,941
<font color="yellow">It must have healed already.</font>

335
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:09,741
<font color="yellow">My skin regenerates quickly, so it healed already.</font>

336
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,371
<font color="yellow">I did write that with my blood.</font>

337
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:15,311
<font color="yellow">At first, you lied that you were studying Korean literature at Ehwa.</font>

338
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,341
<font color="yellow">Now, you lie that red ink is your blood?</font>

339
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:21,111
<font color="yellow">What's in your head? Why do you always tell lies?</font>

340
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:24,411
<font color="yellow">They were white lies.</font>

341
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:28,441
<font color="yellow">That's how much I love you. That's why I did it.</font>

342
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,611
<font color="yellow">This is not a white lie. It's a red lie.</font>

343
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,941
<font color="yellow">So get out right now.</font>

344
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,541
<font color="yellow">I won't take a step until you say...</font>

345
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,571
<font color="yellow">you'll marry me.</font>

346
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,181
<font color="yellow">Are you threatening me?</font>

347
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:43,181
<font color="yellow">I'm not threatening you. I'm loving you.</font>

348
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,611
<font color="yellow">Fine. Then I'll go.</font>

349
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,441
<font color="yellow">Go after we're done talking.</font>

350
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,511
<font color="yellow">What more is there to say?</font>

351
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,971
<font color="yellow">And to be honest, you're not my type.</font>

352
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,911
<font color="yellow">I like the puppy type.</font>

353
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,641
<font color="yellow">But you're the cheetah type.</font>

354
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:02,681
<font color="yellow">And I can't stand people who are pushy like you.</font>

355
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:05,411
<font color="yellow">Then why did you kiss me under the street light...</font>

356
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:08,071
<font color="yellow">a few days ago?</font>

357
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:12,111
<font color="yellow">That's because I was too drunk and...</font>

358
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,241
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I apologised.</font>

359
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,371
<font color="yellow">You stole my lips and try to make it up with an apology?</font>

360
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:19,271
<font color="yellow">Stole your lips? You stole my lips.</font>

361
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,141
<font color="yellow">You were much more aggressive.</font>

362
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:23,941
<font color="yellow">- You thief. - Why are you hitting me?</font>

363
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,341
<font color="yellow">You thief.</font>

364
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,911
<font color="yellow">- That hurts. - Thief.</font>

365
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:28,871
<font color="yellow">- You thief. - Stop hitting me.</font>

366
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,541
<font color="yellow">Freeze!</font>

367
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:33,841
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

368
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:38,271
<font color="yellow">You punk. What are you doing to Sun Nyeo?</font>

369
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,041
<font color="yellow">Who are you? Why are you grabbing me like this?</font>

370
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,841
<font color="yellow">Us? We're Sun Nyeo's cousins.</font>

371
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:44,911
<font color="yellow">Cousins?</font>

372
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:48,071
<font color="yellow">- How did you find me? - How dare you date?</font>

373
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:49,641
<font color="yellow">You're just a kid.</font>

374
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:53,511
<font color="yellow">- Did you call your cousins? - No, I did not.</font>

375
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:57,511
<font color="yellow">Our aunt has been stressed out because of that girl,</font>

376
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,611
<font color="yellow">so we followed her. Is that a problem?</font>

377
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:02,341
<font color="yellow">- No. - You spent a night together, too?</font>

378
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:03,611
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

379
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:07,681
<font color="yellow">We didn't do anything weird. Nothing at all.</font>

380
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,241
<font color="yellow">We drank and slept holding hands.</font>

381
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,711
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to believe that?</font>

382
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,341
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

383
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:20,681
<font color="yellow">You ruined her future, so you should take responsibility.</font>

384
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,071
<font color="yellow">Take responsibility? How?</font>

385
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,571
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? How else?</font>

386
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,771
<font color="yellow">You have to marry her.</font>

387
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:28,641
<font color="yellow">Marry her?</font>

388
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,541
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

389
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,271
<font color="yellow">We're destined for each other.</font>

390
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,311
<font color="yellow">I should have resisted, even if they beat me to death.</font>

391
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,241
<font color="yellow">Whenever I think of that day, I want to stab myself.</font>

392
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:53,011
<font color="yellow">I had no idea you had such a sad story.</font>

393
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,541
<font color="yellow">Anyway, that was me.</font>

394
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,411
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

395
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:01,341
<font color="yellow">You look great with the suit.</font>

396
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,341
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

397
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:11,041
<font color="yellow">- I'm looking for a jacket. - A jacket?</font>

398
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:16,371
<font color="yellow">How about these?</font>

399
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:17,511
<font color="yellow">I'll take this one.</font>

400
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:18,511
<font color="yellow">- This one? - Yes.</font>

401
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,341
<font color="yellow">This is your size, too.</font>

402
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,611
<font color="yellow">This will keep you warm all winter long.</font>

403
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:25,611
<font color="yellow">Please ring this up.</font>

404
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:28,771
<font color="yellow">- Please come this way. - Thank you.</font>

405
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:32,711
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

406
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:40,871
<font color="yellow">What is it now?</font>

407
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:43,541
<font color="yellow">- What is that? - Take a look.</font>

408
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,811
<font color="yellow">It's a total of 367 dollars.</font>

409
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,641
<font color="yellow">It's 367.</font>

410
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:56,211
<font color="yellow">Canned coffee, 60 cents. Soup, 6 dollars.</font>

411
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:58,241
<font color="yellow">This is the total cost...</font>

412
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:00,011
<font color="yellow">from while we were dating.</font>

413
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:02,671
<font color="yellow">I was being nice...</font>

414
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,671
<font color="yellow">and split it right down the middle.</font>

415
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,441
<font color="yellow">As you can see,</font>

416
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,441
<font color="yellow">I didn't add on a penny.</font>

417
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,741
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

418
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:14,811
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

419
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,871
<font color="yellow">Hold on. I have change.</font>

420
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,171
<font color="yellow">Just give me 400.</font>

421
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,241
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

422
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,811
<font color="yellow">it's 33, right?</font>

423
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,541
<font color="yellow">Here's 30, and 3...</font>

424
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:38,911
<font color="yellow">Here you are.</font>

425
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:40,571
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

426
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:53,571
<font color="yellow">Come to my house later.</font>

427
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,141
<font color="yellow">I don't have enough cash.</font>

428
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,711
<font color="yellow">Fine. I will.</font>

429
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:00,011
<font color="yellow">Money matters should be resolved accurately,</font>

430
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:02,671
<font color="yellow">so I'll wait until you get off work...</font>

431
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,211
<font color="yellow">and wait...</font>

432
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,541
<font color="yellow">by your house.</font>

433
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,141
<font color="yellow">I've never met someone like that in my entire life.</font>

434
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:27,811
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

435
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:31,711
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

436
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:35,511
<font color="yellow">I'll take your order.</font>

437
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,071
<font color="yellow">- Do you... - Have...</font>

438
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:39,771
<font color="yellow">- A girlfriend... - Right now?</font>

439
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:42,811
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

440
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:50,611
<font color="yellow">I'd like to get to know you better.</font>

441
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,871
<font color="yellow">- Give me your number. - Give me your number.</font>

442
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,341
<font color="yellow">Those little brats.</font>

443
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:10,441
<font color="yellow">A girlfriend?</font>

444
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:23,011
<font color="yellow">I do have a girlfriend.</font>

445
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,111
<font color="yellow">He is totally my type.</font>

446
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:34,471
<font color="yellow">I'm so sad.</font>

447
00:24:58,271 --> 00:24:59,711
<font color="yellow">You almost made me cry.</font>

448
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:03,211
<font color="yellow">Just now. You said,</font>

449
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,571
<font color="yellow">"I do have a girlfriend."</font>

450
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,141
<font color="yellow">Why did that almost make you cry?</font>

451
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:12,871
<font color="yellow">Weren't you talking about me?</font>

452
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:18,471
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

453
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:22,511
<font color="yellow">I lied, so that they would...</font>

454
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,871
<font color="yellow">leave me alone.</font>

455
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:27,871
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Really.</font>

456
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,611
<font color="yellow">I was happy for nothing.</font>

457
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:34,941
<font color="yellow">Welcome...</font>

458
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:52,411
<font color="yellow">"Welcome"?</font>

459
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,071
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

460
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:55,871
<font color="yellow">Do you work here?</font>

461
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:58,611
<font color="yellow">How did you find me?</font>

462
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,011
<font color="yellow">- Did you follow me? - You're acting like a fool.</font>

463
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,711
<font color="yellow">How could I not?</font>

464
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,841
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

465
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:10,411
<font color="yellow">You say you're not interested in her,</font>

466
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,671
<font color="yellow">but you take off your shirt and show her your naked body...</font>

467
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,341
<font color="yellow">and call her out to meet.</font>

468
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:19,011
<font color="yellow">A man should stand by his word!</font>

469
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:21,071
<font color="yellow">He didn't call me out.</font>

470
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:23,271
<font color="yellow">- I came because I wanted to. - Shut it, brat!</font>

471
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,241
<font color="yellow">I'm warning you.</font>

472
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:33,241
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it if you don't leave my daughter alone!</font>

473
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,511
<font color="yellow">I told you Tae Yang did nothing wrong!</font>

474
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,741
<font color="yellow">Shut it!</font>

475
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:39,211
<font color="yellow">If you see my daughter again,</font>

476
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,271
<font color="yellow">I really won't forgive you!</font>

477
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,741
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

478
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,711
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - Tae Yang.</font>

479
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:50,911
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

480
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,371
<font color="yellow">My bag. My bag.</font>

481
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:58,011
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Tae Yang, I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

482
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,741
<font color="yellow">She should have gone when I told her to.</font>

483
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:15,371
<font color="yellow">She'll probably get in trouble at home.</font>

484
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,471
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

485
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:27,011
<font color="yellow">That hurts!</font>

486
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:29,241
<font color="yellow">How could you like someone who can't get a job...</font>

487
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:31,011
<font color="yellow">and has to work at a burger joint?</font>

488
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:32,811
<font color="yellow">And whose fault is that?</font>

489
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,641
<font color="yellow">What will I do with you?</font>

490
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,811
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried your brother is?</font>

491
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:38,811
<font color="yellow">Tell him to worry about himself.</font>

492
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:40,341
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang is 100 times better...</font>

493
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:42,111
<font color="yellow">than that witch Ji Yun.</font>

494
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:43,811
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

495
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:45,411
<font color="yellow">I'll make myself clear.</font>

496
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,171
<font color="yellow">That witch Ji Yun will never become my sister-in-law.</font>

497
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:51,541
<font color="yellow">How did he fall for that evil witch, anyway?</font>

498
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,641
<font color="yellow">Ms Min Hyo Won. Just worry about yourself.</font>

499
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,711
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry about him. - That hurts!</font>

500
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:59,971
<font color="yellow">From this moment on, you cannot step foot...</font>

501
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,071
<font color="yellow">outside of this house without my permission.</font>

502
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:03,211
<font color="yellow">- Got it? - What?</font>

503
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:06,511
<font color="yellow">- You can't do that. - Yes, I can.</font>

504
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,911
<font color="yellow">- Darn it. - Go upstairs.</font>

505
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,211
<font color="yellow">Our tailor shop...</font>

506
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,111
<font color="yellow">is entering a department store?</font>

507
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,041
<font color="yellow">Yes. It hasn't been finalised yet.</font>

508
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,811
<font color="yellow">I wanted to get your opinions before submitting...</font>

509
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:20,441
<font color="yellow">the proposal to the department store.</font>

510
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:23,711
<font color="yellow">I'm all for it, of course.</font>

511
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:27,371
<font color="yellow">Our tailor shop will become national and become huge.</font>

512
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:29,671
<font color="yellow">That's true, but could this small crew...</font>

513
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:30,941
<font color="yellow">meet their demands?</font>

514
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,871
<font color="yellow">That concerns me as well.</font>

515
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:35,241
<font color="yellow">So I suggest we control the volume...</font>

516
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:38,041
<font color="yellow">by taking only advance requests...</font>

517
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,411
<font color="yellow">and in-person requests.</font>

518
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:41,171
<font color="yellow">We can hire more workers...</font>

519
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:44,641
<font color="yellow">or collaborate with my father's mentees who are...</font>

520
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,171
<font color="yellow">spread around the country.</font>

521
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,611
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, why aren't you saying anything?</font>

522
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:53,041
<font color="yellow">Why is she so deep in thought?</font>

523
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:54,211
<font color="yellow">- Yun Shil. - Oh my gosh.</font>

524
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:55,941
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

525
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:59,111
<font color="yellow">- Why are you so jumpy? - I'm sorry.</font>

526
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,071
<font color="yellow">My mind was elsewhere.</font>

527
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,441
<font color="yellow">- Master. - Yes?</font>

528
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:11,441
<font color="yellow">I'll take Yun Shil with me to research the department stores.</font>

529
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:14,911
<font color="yellow">Okay. We need to do that...</font>

530
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:17,711
<font color="yellow">in order to prepare the proposal anyway.</font>

531
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,271
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead. - Okay.</font>

532
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,311
<font color="yellow">- Get ready to go out. - Sorry?</font>

533
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,641
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

534
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,971
<font color="yellow">Weren't we going to the department store?</font>

535
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:39,071
<font color="yellow">We're playing hooky.</font>

536
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,411
<font color="yellow">Hooky?</font>

537
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:43,411
<font color="yellow">You look stressed out,</font>

538
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:45,741
<font color="yellow">so I want to take you somewhere to get some air.</font>

539
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:48,511
<font color="yellow">You must be busy with the shop.</font>

540
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:50,841
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Let's go back.</font>

541
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,641
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

542
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:13,071
<font color="yellow">Isn't the ocean air clearing your head?</font>

543
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,011
<font color="yellow">Yes. I feel like I can breathe again.</font>

544
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:19,371
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

545
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,171
<font color="yellow">See? Aren't you glad you listened to me?</font>

546
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,411
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

547
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:36,941
<font color="yellow">When I'm with you, I become more courageous...</font>

548
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,871
<font color="yellow">and even feel stronger.</font>

549
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:40,611
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't.</font>

550
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,911
<font color="yellow">Don't you trust me at all?</font>

551
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:45,641
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

552
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:48,711
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

553
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,441
<font color="yellow">We aren't alone. We have each other.</font>

554
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:54,071
<font color="yellow">Let's share our burdens...</font>

555
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,041
<font color="yellow">and double our joys, okay?</font>

556
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:03,011
<font color="yellow">I know you're upset because I met Gi Pyo without telling you,</font>

557
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,471
<font color="yellow">but I thought that was right.</font>

558
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:08,871
<font color="yellow">For us to date in secret...</font>

559
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:13,571
<font color="yellow">is like admitting that our love is forbidden.</font>

560
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:16,841
<font color="yellow">So I want to...</font>

561
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:20,141
<font color="yellow">tell my parents right away.</font>

562
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,941
<font color="yellow">Give me a little more time.</font>

563
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:26,671
<font color="yellow">I need to prepare myself.</font>

564
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,711
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

565
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:36,011
<font color="yellow">- I have... - By the way.</font>

566
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,641
<font color="yellow">- What did Master Bae say? - Well...</font>

567
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:43,171
<font color="yellow">He said he'd back us up, of course.</font>

568
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:47,171
<font color="yellow">Was he upset that we hadn't told him sooner?</font>

569
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,271
<font color="yellow">Dating at work is always like that.</font>

570
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:52,541
<font color="yellow">Sam Do's good-hearted enough to understand.</font>

571
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,071
<font color="yellow">He said he will support us, so don't worry.</font>

572
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,611
<font color="yellow">I got you a...</font>

573
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:18,041
<font color="yellow">I think Leather Jacket noticed something.</font>

574
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:20,971
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

575
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,611
<font color="yellow">- Did something happen? - It's nothing.</font>

576
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,311
<font color="yellow">Wait right there.</font>

577
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:31,871
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did you drop something?</font>

578
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:34,141
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

579
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:37,911
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

580
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:40,511
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. All is well.</font>

581
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:44,211
<font color="yellow">You're drenched. Are you okay?</font>

582
00:32:44,741 --> 00:32:45,771
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

583
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:49,911
<font color="yellow">I think I'm...</font>

584
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:51,971
<font color="yellow">not okay.</font>

585
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,511
<font color="yellow">My dear.</font>

586
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:22,511
<font color="yellow">My goodness. My husband isn't that small,</font>

587
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:24,611
<font color="yellow">but you're way too tall.</font>

588
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,441
<font color="yellow">Thanks for lending me his trousers.</font>

589
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,841
<font color="yellow">I'll return them as soon as my clothes dry.</font>

590
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:32,641
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. Come and eat.</font>

591
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:33,771
<font color="yellow">The food's ready.</font>

592
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,611
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Thank you.</font>

593
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:37,771
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

594
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:44,941
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, taking a photo of this?</font>

595
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:47,511
<font color="yellow">Tracksuit bottoms suit you well.</font>

596
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,571
<font color="yellow">You look good. Very good.</font>

597
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:52,071
<font color="yellow">That's impossible. Delete those.</font>

598
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,241
<font color="yellow">I won't. I'll look at them whenever I feel down.</font>

599
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:01,641
<font color="yellow">This is pathetic. I meant to draw a heart in the sand...</font>

600
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:04,511
<font color="yellow">and put the necklace around her neck.</font>

601
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:07,271
<font color="yellow">I just ruined my chances.</font>

602
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:09,211
<font color="yellow">I'm freezing.</font>

603
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:20,971
<font color="yellow">Why won't you eat?</font>

604
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,471
<font color="yellow">I think I'm catching a cold. I lost my appetite.</font>

605
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:26,611
<font color="yellow">Then eat the fish for its flavour.</font>

606
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:29,941
<font color="yellow">That was lame.</font>

607
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:31,941
<font color="yellow">I feel even worse now.</font>

608
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:36,111
<font color="yellow">You feed me, then.</font>

609
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,471
<font color="yellow">I had to battle the waves and all that...</font>

610
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:39,971
<font color="yellow">drained me of my energy.</font>

611
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:43,471
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly. You didn't battle anything.</font>

612
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,441
<font color="yellow">You just splashed a few times.</font>

613
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:48,941
<font color="yellow">That's not all I did. How could you put it like that?</font>

614
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:51,871
<font color="yellow">Whose fault is it that I have a cold?</font>

615
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,971
<font color="yellow">- Is it my fault? - Of course it is.</font>

616
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:57,011
<font color="yellow">- Why? - It was your...</font>

617
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:02,041
<font color="yellow">Don't ask. You don't need to know.</font>

618
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:04,141
<font color="yellow">Anyway, feed me some food.</font>

619
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:05,581
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Yes.</font>

620
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:18,471
<font color="yellow">It melts in my mouth because you fed it to me.</font>

621
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:21,271
<font color="yellow">Give me some soup.</font>

622
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:22,871
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

623
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,241
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

624
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:27,371
<font color="yellow">I feel really unwell right now.</font>

625
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:28,741
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay.</font>

626
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:39,711
<font color="yellow">That tastes good.</font>

627
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:44,611
<font color="yellow">You two look like a mummy bird feeding a baby bird.</font>

628
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:45,741
<font color="yellow">It's so cute.</font>

629
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:53,141
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Don't starve your baby bird.</font>

630
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:54,971
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

631
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:57,041
<font color="yellow">An oyster.</font>

632
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:58,171
<font color="yellow">An oyster?</font>

633
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,771
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

634
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:04,771

<font color="yellow">(Shellfish Story)</font>

639
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:49,811
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

640
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,311
<font color="yellow">I felt bad that we had a good meal...</font>

641
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,081
<font color="yellow">so I bought some fish and shrimp.</font>

642
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,171

643

644
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:05,081
<font color="yellow">Those are the shoes we bought last time.</font>

645
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:06,771
<font color="yellow">Yes. What do you think?</font>

646
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:09,371
<font color="yellow">They suit you.</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's see...</font>

648
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,941
<font color="yellow">Now we look like a real couple.</font>

649
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:16,971
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

650
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,471
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

651
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:27,241

652
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,641
<font color="yellow">let's go back to the beach.</font>

653
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:29,871
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

654
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,671
<font color="yellow">To do what I didn't get to do.</font>

655
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:32,841
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

656
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:36,611
<font color="yellow">You know, draw a huge heart in the sand...</font>

657
00:37:36,611 --> 00:37:39,441
<font color="yellow">and run after each other yelling, "Catch me if you can."</font>

658
00:37:39,581 --> 00:37:41,871
<font color="yellow">What every couple does at the beach.</font>

659
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:43,341
<font color="yellow">Did you look it up online?</font>

660
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:45,271
<font color="yellow">Why... Yes.</font>

661
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:48,581
<font color="yellow">You said you caught a cold. Let's just go home.</font>

662
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:50,741
<font color="yellow">We came all the way here. I can't just go home like this.</font>

663
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:53,581
<font color="yellow">We should get back before Ms Choi prepares dinner.</font>

664
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,741
<font color="yellow">When can I give her this, then?</font>

665
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:04,211

669
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:26,941

672
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:35,271
<font color="yellow">You worked for us all your life.</font>

673

679
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,871
<font color="yellow">I bought them to make you smile,</font>

680

00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:42,541
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

776
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:48,711
<font color="yellow">Do you have any difficulty reading the paper?</font>

777
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:49,911
<font color="yellow">Not yet. I can manage.</font>

778
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:51,711
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

779
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:56,571
<font color="yellow">These are vitamins that are good for your eyesight.</font>

780
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,641
<font color="yellow">Take two of them each day.</font>

781
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:01,011
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

782
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,971
<font color="yellow">Seeing you read the paper...</font>

783
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,541
<font color="yellow">makes me cry.</font>

784
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:10,971
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

785
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,671
<font color="yellow">Where's Dong Jin?</font>

786
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:13,771
<font color="yellow">He's...</font>

787
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,741
<font color="yellow">meeting a client.</font>

788
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:17,311
<font color="yellow">- Is he late? - Yes.</font>

789
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:18,841
<font color="yellow">He hasn't called yet.</font>

790
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,441
<font color="yellow">He should be home for dinner.</font>

791
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:27,211
<font color="yellow">About...</font>

792
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:28,941
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

793
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,871
<font color="yellow">She works so hard and so well.</font>

794
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:34,811
<font color="yellow">She does the work of three people.</font>

795
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,911
<font color="yellow">She's sweet and skilled.</font>

796
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:40,241
<font color="yellow">She's nicer than most girls.</font>

797
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,411
<font color="yellow">She is.</font>

798
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:45,511
<font color="yellow">At first she and Dong Jin got off on the wrong foot,</font>

799
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:47,571
<font color="yellow">but now they get along so well.</font>

800
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:48,741
<font color="yellow">Everything's great.</font>

801
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:51,041
<font color="yellow">It would be so nice...</font>

802
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,571
<font color="yellow">if she were your daughter-in-law.</font>

803
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:54,571
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

804
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:56,841
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

805
00:45:58,741 --> 00:45:59,811
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

806
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:00,811
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

807
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:05,311
<font color="yellow">Did you meet our client?</font>

808
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:07,211
<font color="yellow">- What? - Client.</font>

809
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:08,771
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

810
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,711
<font color="yellow">It worked out just fine.</font>

811
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:12,871
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

812
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:16,911
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil bought it for you.</font>

813
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:19,141
<font color="yellow">- Yun Shil? - Yes.</font>

814
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:21,811
<font color="yellow">She saw them at a market and thought they looked fresh.</font>

815
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:23,241
<font color="yellow">She bought it for you.</font>

816
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:26,041
<font color="yellow">She should've kept it for herself.</font>

817
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:28,341
<font color="yellow">Shall we have soup stew?</font>

818
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:29,911
<font color="yellow">I'd like that.</font>

819
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:32,871
<font color="yellow">I was just...</font>

820
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:37,011
<font color="yellow">talking to them about Yun Shil.</font>

821
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:38,871
<font color="yellow">What? What about?</font>

822
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:41,911
<font color="yellow">I said she is a hard worker.</font>

823
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:44,041
<font color="yellow">It was just nonsense. Don't bother.</font>

824
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:45,541
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

825
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:50,971
<font color="yellow">It's meant to be a secret.</font>

826
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,711
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything.</font>

827
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:59,011
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

828
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:02,371
<font color="yellow">They're as fresh as if they came straight from the sea.</font>

829
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,371
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

830
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,641
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms Choi.</font>

831
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:13,611
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin just brought home the fish.</font>

832
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,971
<font color="yellow">It's not much. I hope you enjoy it.</font>

833
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:18,911
<font color="yellow">We will, thanks to you.</font>

834
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:22,741
<font color="yellow">Where did you find such fresh fish?</font>

835
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,541
<font color="yellow">A distant relative...</font>

836
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:27,211
<font color="yellow">sent them to me.</font>

837
00:47:27,941 --> 00:47:31,141
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin said you bought them. - What?</font>

838
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,041
<font color="yellow">Did a relative send these?</font>

839
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:34,611
<font color="yellow">Yes. See...</font>

840
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:38,311
<font color="yellow">A distant relative bought them at a market...</font>

841
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,471
<font color="yellow">and sent them to me,</font>

842
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:44,071
<font color="yellow">- and I gave it to you. - That's so complicated.</font>

843
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:46,771
<font color="yellow">Thank you anyway.</font>

844
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:49,271
<font color="yellow">You're welcome. Have a good night.</font>

845
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,341
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

846
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,371
<font color="yellow">do I feel so scared?</font>

847
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:14,341
<font color="yellow">I should have gave her...</font>

848
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,111
<font color="yellow">on the beach in the sunset.</font>

849
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:20,811
<font color="yellow">I totally ruined my plan.</font>

850
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:30,541
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

851
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:36,641
<font color="yellow">Who's this??</font>

852
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,541
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

853
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,111
<font color="yellow">Call Dong Sook for me.</font>

854
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:41,141
<font color="yellow">Call her yourself.</font>

855
00:48:41,511 --> 00:48:43,411
<font color="yellow">Isn't it over between you?</font>

856
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,711
<font color="yellow">It may be, but we have a deal to settle.</font>

857
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:46,811
<font color="yellow">Call her for me.</font>

858
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,671
<font color="yellow">A deal? What deal?</font>

859
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:49,911
<font color="yellow">What could it be?</font>

860
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:52,711
<font color="yellow">The money I spent on our dates.</font>

861
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:54,711
<font color="yellow">We decided to split it.</font>

862
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:55,741
<font color="yellow">Go get her.</font>

863
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,011
<font color="yellow">You are amazing.</font>

864
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:02,771
<font color="yellow">How could you think of halving the cost of your dates?</font>

865
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:04,611
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm a landlord.</font>

866
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:06,311
<font color="yellow">I'm more powerful than a deity.</font>

867
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:09,141
<font color="yellow">I just can't stand you any more.</font>

868
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:11,141
<font color="yellow">Is she not home yet?</font>

869
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,771
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

870
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:15,111
<font color="yellow">I need to bill you as well,</font>

871
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:18,541
<font color="yellow">but I won't ask for it as I'm too pity for you.</font>

872
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,311
<font color="yellow">- What bill? - Think.</font>

873
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:23,871
<font color="yellow">You bashed my head in a few days ago.</font>

874
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,911
<font color="yellow">I bought an ointment and bandages.</font>

875
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:27,811
<font color="yellow">I was going to bill you,</font>

876
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:31,141
<font color="yellow">but decided that you couldn't afford to pay up. Okay?</font>

877
00:49:32,571 --> 00:49:33,571
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

878
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,541
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Da Jeong. - If you left my mum over me,</font>

879
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,071
<font color="yellow">you don't have to.</font>

880
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,771
<font color="yellow">I'll live here with my grandma and grandpa.</font>

881
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:46,411
<font color="yellow">How thoughtful.</font>

882
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:49,741
<font color="yellow">You're way more thoughtful than your mum.</font>

883
00:49:49,911 --> 00:49:52,071
<font color="yellow">Let's get this out in the open.</font>

884
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:54,711
<font color="yellow">You and I aren't related at all...</font>

885
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:55,941
<font color="yellow">and we dislike each other.</font>

886
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:57,811
<font color="yellow">Your mum is weird.</font>

887
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,741
<font color="yellow">Why does she want her grown daughter to move in with us?</font>

888
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:02,741
<font color="yellow">That's like one plus one for me.</font>

889
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:05,741
<font color="yellow">How dare you say something like that.</font>

890
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:09,641
<font color="yellow">Why do you always grab my collar?</font>

891
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:11,241
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

892
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:13,611
<font color="yellow">Da Jeong, go on inside.</font>

893
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,211
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Just go on inside.</font>

894
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:25,971
<font color="yellow">Marrying Dong Sook makes Da Jeong your daughter.</font>

895
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:28,111
<font color="yellow">How dare you hurt her like that?</font>

896
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:31,071
<font color="yellow">Jerks like you need to be taught a lesson.</font>

897
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,641
<font color="yellow">Are you addicted to grabbing people by the throat?</font>

898
00:50:33,871 --> 00:50:37,541
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare touch my face or my body.</font>

899
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,771
<font color="yellow">If you do again, I'll sue you.</font>

900
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:42,211
<font color="yellow">If you truly love someone,</font>

901
00:50:42,341 --> 00:50:45,571
<font color="yellow">you must accept the person as they are.</font>

902
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:48,611
<font color="yellow">You didn't love Dong Sook.</font>

903
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,711
<font color="yellow">You are a pathetic singer. No wonder you sing about love.</font>

904
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:53,841
<font color="yellow">Trashy landlords like you have no right...</font>

905
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:56,571
<font color="yellow">to love someone like Dong Sook, okay?</font>

906
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:57,641
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

907
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:01,241
<font color="yellow">You're such a joke. Crawl back to your building!</font>

908
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:07,971
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is she?</font>

909
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:10,271
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she back yet?</font>

910
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:31,971
<font color="yellow">We're told never to trust anyone,</font>

911
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,771
<font color="yellow">but how could she do this to us?</font>

912
00:51:34,111 --> 00:51:38,141
<font color="yellow">Almost everyone in the market lent her money.</font>

913
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:40,971
<font color="yellow">She took that and all the money we lent her.</font>

914
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:43,611
<font color="yellow">She planned this for a long time.</font>

915
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:52,111
<font color="yellow">We lost our rent deposit...</font>

916
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:55,311
<font color="yellow">and now the money I lent her.</font>

917
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,471
<font color="yellow">We're really dirt poor now.</font>

918
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:07,511
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

919
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:25,441
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

920
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,671
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

921
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:27,671
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

922
00:52:30,571 --> 00:52:32,271
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

923
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:35,871
<font color="yellow">I must have taken a wrong turn.</font>

924
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,141
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

925
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,571
<font color="yellow">I was so deep in thought. I got off the bus at the wrong stop.</font>

926
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:44,841
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

927
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:47,141
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking about?</font>

928
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:48,911
<font color="yellow">I wonder myself.</font>

929
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:56,011
<font color="yellow">I think I got off a stop too soon.</font>

930
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:59,111
<font color="yellow">I'll take another bus. I won't be long.</font>

931
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:02,041
<font color="yellow">Why do you sound so upset? Is something wrong?</font>

932
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:06,441
<font color="yellow">Why would there be?</font>

933
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:10,811
<font color="yellow">I'll get right on the next bus.</font>

934
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:18,811
<font color="yellow">I guess this is how he felt...</font>

935
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:22,471
<font color="yellow">when he found out he owed 50,000 dollars.</font>

936
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:27,071
<font color="yellow">I had no idea...</font>

937
00:53:27,711 --> 00:53:29,511
<font color="yellow">and gave him a hard time.</font>

938
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:38,871
<font color="yellow">Where's the nearest bus stop?</font>

939
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:51,911
<font color="yellow">Open the door right now.</font>

940
00:53:52,071 --> 00:53:54,011
<font color="yellow">Promise me you'll leave Tae Yang.</font>

941
00:53:54,671 --> 00:53:56,811
<font color="yellow">- Then I'll let you out. - I can't do that.</font>

942
00:53:57,511 --> 00:53:59,971
<font color="yellow">Then you'll have to stay in there for the next 10 days.</font>

943
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,071
<font color="yellow">Maybe even a whole month, okay?</font>

944
00:54:02,111 --> 00:54:05,011
<font color="yellow">Even if you lock me up for a whole year,</font>

945
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,041
<font color="yellow">I won't break up with him.</font>

946
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,841
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you're such a romantic.</font>

947
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:13,041
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang and Choi Ji Yun are here.</font>

948
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,711
<font color="yellow">Without even calling ahead?</font>

949
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:23,441
<font color="yellow">We have a visitor, so stay quiet. Okay?</font>

950
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:26,411
<font color="yellow">I'll jump out my window if you don't let me out.</font>

951
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:27,771
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

952
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:31,271
<font color="yellow">Give me back my phone, then.</font>

953
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,711
<font color="yellow">I want to hear Tae Yang's voice. Please?</font>

954
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:37,911
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

955
00:54:56,341 --> 00:54:57,711
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mother.</font>

956
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,111
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

957
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:02,411
<font color="yellow">I invited her over for dinner.</font>

958
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:05,241
<font color="yellow">We should meet at a restaurant. Why to bring her here?</font>

959
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:10,611
<font color="yellow">I was trying to think of a way to get close to you...</font>

960
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:14,711
<font color="yellow">and Hyo Sang suggested that we should eat together often.</font>

961
00:55:15,071 --> 00:55:17,071
<font color="yellow">I know it's rude, but here I am.</font>

962
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:22,471
<font color="yellow">Is Hyo Won out?</font>

963
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:23,871
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

964
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,571
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

965
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:27,241
<font color="yellow">She's out.</font>

966
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:30,141
<font color="yellow">I'll help set the table.</font>

967
00:55:35,211 --> 00:55:37,811
<font color="yellow">Did Hyo Won go to see Tae Yang?</font>

968
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:40,111
<font color="yellow">I locked her up.</font>

969
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:41,811
<font color="yellow">You did what?</font>

970
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:46,111
<font color="yellow">I had a padlock put on her door to lock her up.</font>

971
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:49,371
<font color="yellow">I know she's a bit mad and all,</font>

972
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,471
<font color="yellow">but you should talk to her, not lock her up.</font>

973
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:54,841
<font color="yellow">She's in no state of mind to do as she's told.</font>

974
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:01,941
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang is causing trouble for so many of us.</font>

975
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:12,141
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault that my mum's a mistress.</font>

976
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:15,171
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault that you're poor.</font>

977
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:18,371
<font color="yellow">That's why your conditions are of...</font>

978
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:20,611
<font color="yellow">no concern to me.</font>

979
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,841
<font color="yellow">We all lack something...</font>

980
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:27,571
<font color="yellow">and if that's money, then that's actually a relief.</font>

981
00:56:30,741 --> 00:56:32,311
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me?</font>

982
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:43,571
<font color="yellow">(Kang Tae Yang)</font>

983
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:48,071
<font color="yellow">(Lee Chang Hee, Kang Tae Yang)</font>

984
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,571
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

985
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:54,841
<font color="yellow">Isn't it beautiful?</font>

986
00:56:58,171 --> 00:57:01,011
<font color="yellow">Your girlfriend came by and stocked the fridge.</font>

987
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:03,471
<font color="yellow">Who, Hyo Won?</font>

988
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:06,941
<font color="yellow">As a fellow man, I'm so envious.</font>

989
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:10,141
<font color="yellow">Where did you find an angel like her?</font>

990
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:14,341
<font color="yellow">The quality of the food is incredible.</font>

991
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:18,111
<font color="yellow">There's tteokgalbi, expensive fish, salted fish roe and abalone.</font>

992
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,671
<font color="yellow">Those are special dishes.</font>

993
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,971
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, can I have some?</font>

994
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:25,971
<font color="yellow">Sure you can.</font>

995
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:27,171
<font color="yellow">Really? Thanks.</font>

996
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:33,071
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

997
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,111
<font color="yellow">Why didn't she call?</font>

998
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:42,941
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

999
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:45,641
<font color="yellow">For some fresh air. I feel stuffy.</font>

1000
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:47,041
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a cold?</font>

1001
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:50,241
<font color="yellow">I'll just walk around the block. It won't be long.</font>

1002
00:57:50,871 --> 00:57:51,911
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1003
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:57,471
<font color="yellow">It's not like he has a wife to keep him company.</font>

1004
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,741
<font color="yellow">The winter nights must be so long and lonesome.</font>

1005
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:14,611

1006
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:17,571

1008
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:21,741
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

1009
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:24,341
<font color="yellow">To give you something.</font>

1010
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:25,341
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1011
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:28,111
<font color="yellow">I just passed the junction.</font>

1012
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:29,511
<font color="yellow">I'll be there in three minutes.</font>

1013
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,871
<font color="yellow">The road looks different at night.</font>

1014
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:48,571
<font color="yellow">Is it this alley?</font>

1015
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:51,641
<font color="yellow">Or that one?</font>

1016

1050

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1051
01:02:42,941 --> 01:02:45,041
<font color="yellow">I have a pretty strong immune system.</font>

1053
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:49,041
<font color="yellow">I see. That's a relief.</font>

1054
