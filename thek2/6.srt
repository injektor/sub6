<i>The elevator is going down.</i>

4
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,600
All right.

5
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,100
Make Kim Soo Young lose
his job as a professor

6
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,200
and claim that his role in this
election has been questionable.

7
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,700
And ask for about
three billion won as a settlement fee.

8
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,000
It'll be hard for him to
find a new job then.

9
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm sure that he has
terrible credit already as it is.

10
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,500
Madam, it may prove to be
a bit difficult for us to win this case.

11
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,600
Who cares if we lose the case?

12
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
We can drag the legal proceedings
out for at least three years.

13
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,100
By that time, his reputation will have
already been irreparable damaged.

14
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,500
Oh, I see.
I understand.

15
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Make sure you block every option he
has so he can't get a job anywhere.

16
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,700
All right, next.

17
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,100
Director Go Yoon Young?

18
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
There's not much
about this guy.

19
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,890
<i>There's a record of him being charged
with something, but not indicted.</i>

20
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,890
What is it?

21
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,790
<i>A record of a video chat was
submitted as evidence.</i>

22
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,790
And do you have a video too?
Turn it on for us.

23
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,790
That's enough.
Turn it off.

24
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,000
Disgusting.

25
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Release the video and make everyone
think that he's a despicable pervert.

26
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,700
And get a testimony from someone
saying that he sexually assaulted them.

27
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,000
It'll be perfect.

28
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:15,700
Show that video to his kids first
before releasing it to the world.

30
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,890
What? His kids were caught up
in sex video scandals too, after all.

31
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,590
Madam. Just because we show his kids a
video of their father acting like this--

32
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,890
They'll probably want
to commit suicide.

33
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,590
Or maybe they won't
go through with it

34
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,390
with something as weak as this.

35
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,000
I was giving this subject some thought
at the family meeting at the funeral.

36
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,300
Which method of death

37
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,000
would be the most painless?

38
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
And...

39
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Yes. We'll do as you say
right away, Madam.

40
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,590
Geez, you surprised me!

41
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,800
<i>[Episode 6]</i>
How about knocking?

42
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,700
Do you know what's going
on right now, Madam?

43
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,890
What?
What is it?

44
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,500
Mr. Je Ha...
Mr. Je Ha is...

45
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,890
This is about that damned
Mr. Je Ha again? What is it now?

46
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,300
Oh my!

47
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,500
What's with you?

48
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,300
Geez.
Are you that happy?

49
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,800
How is it that he was invited
to Cloud Nine so soon?

50
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
- I know, right?
- Oh my.

51
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,090
He's already moved up
so much at his young age!

52
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,390
Yeah. Wow.

53
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,300
I heard that he did something amazing
yesterday, and I guess that was true.

54
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Yeah. Now all I need to do
is make Mr. Je Ha mine.

55
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Oh my god!

56
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,700
Then I'll be...

57
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,700
You have no chance now.

58
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,200
How will you possibly have a chance with
him now? He'll never come back here.

59
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,890
Geez, you.

60
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,390
I heard that there isn't anyone
watching the cameras tonight.

61
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,000
So don't go around doing ridiculous
things like before and protect Anna!

62
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Geez.

63
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,500
But where did that person go
off to on a day like this?

64
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,200
Damn it!

65
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,890
Yes, I'll do as you've said, Madam.

66
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,300
Oh, you're here?

67
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,500
Go inside.
She's waiting for you.

68
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,890
Take a seat.

69
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,000
This is nice.

70
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,590
It's perfect for blocking off
any potential eavesdroppers.

71
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,140
Oh, you sure are knowledgeable.

72
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Is this room on the B or C level?

73
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Figured you'd notice.
We're at D level.

74
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,500
Nobody would be able to hear anything
going on in here. Not even a gunshot.

75
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,890
Then you wouldn't be able to hear
a gunshot outside from in here, either.

76
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,390
Wow, you sure did use a lot
of money for this, didn't you?

77
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,700
So, what did you want to tell me
that you called me all the way here?

78
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,800
No, I called you because
I want to hear you tell me something.

79
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,700
About you.

80
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,800
So what do you
want to hear, exactly?

81
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,500
Everything.

82
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,500
The story of someone who rushed
into a den of enemies without a command.

83
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,890
The story of someone who even
thought to bring an umbrella for me.

84
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:11,300
And the life story of someone who still
carries around a handkerchief nowadays.

85
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,390
I'm curious.

86
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,890
I'm curious, too.

87
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,500
Why did I live my life like that?

88
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,390
So, what is it that
you really want to hear about?

89
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,390
<i>That's the truth, though.</i>

90
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,500
I heard about your life in the military
from Chief Joo, for the most part.

91
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,590
All right. I want to hear what
happened to you in Iraq now.

92
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,800
We're going to begin our
hunt for Park Kwan Soo soon.

93
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
Is that a good enough
reason for you?

94
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,990
I'm sure you're well aware of this,
but this room is completely soundproof.

95
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,800
Nobody in this world can hear
a word of what we say in this room.

96
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,490
Then who are the people listening to our
conversation from the mikes that are on?

97
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,990
My little Miss Mirror.

98
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,490
She's like a witch's mirror.

99
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:20,700
Mirror, Mirror.
Who's the fairest person in the world?

100
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,590
You know the fairy tale, don't you?

101
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,900
What's with that look you're giving
me as if I'm a crazy person?

102
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,090
Fine, then.
Watch.

103
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:40,300
Mirror, Mirror.
Who's the fairest person in the world?

104
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,490
<i>Snow White.</i>

105
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,090
She even has a sense of humor too!

106
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,800
<i>Assemblyman Jang interacted with the
people by visiting the historical market.</i>

107
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,090
<i>After meeting with his
political opponents</i>

108
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,490
<i>Assemblyman Jang will visit a Catholic
church in Ayang-dong tomorrow afternoon</i>

109
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,990
<i>for the five-year memorial
celebration there.</i>

110
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,700
<i>Now, for our next story.</i>

111
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,900
<i>The Catholic church
in Ayang-dong?</i>

112
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,800
An AI?

113
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,700
Yes. She's an AI that works
with voice commands.

114
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,700
They're even on a lot of
people's phones nowadays.

115
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,090
Of course, my Mirror is a lot
smarter than those ones.

116
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,490
I'm sure you've guessed by now,
but this place is like JSS's brain.

117
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,200
This is where we collect
and store all the secrets of the world.

118
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,820
And a place where we process
all the big data on the web.

119
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,490
Mirror finds the most accurate
answer for the questions I ask

120
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,700
by combing through all this
information that we've collected

121
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,300
and shows it to me.
That's the kind of software she is.

122
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,300
So tell me about you.

123
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,200
If you do, Mirror will answer
all of your questions for you.

124
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Why do you think that I have
unanswered questions?

125
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,490
Because if you didn't, you never
would've needed to join JSS.

126
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,700
Isn't that right?

127
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,800
What's with that look now?

128
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,090
You look like a child who was
caught stealing from his mother's purse.

129
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
You don't need to go out of your
way to try and sneak in here.

130
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,090
Every method you can
think of will be futile.

131
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,490
You can't access any data from here
without Mirror's help.

132
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,400
And Mirror is configured so that
she only obeys my voice commands.

133
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,090
I'll take two!

134
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,490
Get into my mouth!

135
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,800
Wow, look at those abs!

136
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,300
So, talk.

137
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:17,400
Tell me why you're after Park Kwan Soo
and about what happened to you.

138
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,990
There was a Kumar refugee woman named
Raniya whom I met while I was in Iraq.

139
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,700
I wanted to get her out
of that hellish place.

140
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,090
Hey guys!
What's up?

141
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,090
- Hi.
- Hi.

142
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,700
Raniya!

143
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
They want you to take
a look at this document.

144
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,700
Raniya!

145
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,190
Raniya!

146
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,700
I love you!

147
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,800
This is important, so it can't be
leaked no matter what.

148
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Got that?

149
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,200
- He says that he's certain.
- He is, eh?

151
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,200
What do I do?

152
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,100
Then I was framed for
murdering Raniya and arrested.

153
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,560
But thankfully, I was able to
escape within a week.

154
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,900
But after I escaped, it turned out
that the Korean politician

155
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,100
I didn't even know, named Park
Kwan Soo, fled the country the next day.

156
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,200
And the Blackstone camp
had already turned on me.

157
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,290
So I ran, hid among the Syrian
refugees, and traveled through Turkey

158
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,290
to get to Europe.

159
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,700
That's everything.

160
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,200
This is the reason why
I must kill Park Kwan Soo.

161
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,290
Looks like you definitely
have a good enough reason.

162
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,290
Ugh.
Oh man.

163
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,790
Mirror. You heard all that, right?

164
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,900
Now answer all of
Agent Kim Je Ha's questions for him.

165
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
<i>Yes, Madam.</i>

166
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,700
I want to know what Park Kwan Soo
did on September 15th, 2010.

167
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,490
Looks like he was quite busy.

168
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,790
He was at a small
camp in the desert

169
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,990
at 3:30 p.m. on that day,
about 30 minutes from his hotel.

170
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,600
Why was he there?

171
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,490
<i>There are no materials
pertaining to that query.</i>

172
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Mirror.

173
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,490
From this point onward,
increase your queries by twofold

174
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,990
and use twice as many resources
to answer every question.

175
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,700
<i>Searching again under new conditions.</i>

176
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,790
<i>53.3 percent chance that he was
engaging in secret talks with someone.</i>

177
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,200
And who were the people who
were present at that meeting?

178
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,100
<i>Can you provide the location
of the tent in which they were meeting?</i>

179
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,490
Near Interstate Two in Kumar.

180
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,100
Seven kilometers away from a crosswalk
after coming down the hill.

181
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,490
<i>Assemblyman Park Kwan Soo.
A bodyguard from Blackstone.</i>

182
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,700
<i>Interpreter Raniya.</i>

183
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,700
<i>And Abdul Omar, leader of the Kumar,
was another main party at this meeting.</i>

184
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
What was the reason
for his visit?

185
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,700
<i>The tent they were speaking in
was Abdul Omar's guarded tent.</i>

186
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,200
What was the reason
for the secret meeting?

187
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,700
<i>Unknown.</i>

188
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,990
Why did Park Kwan Soo have a Blackstone
soldier kill Raniya after he left?

189
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,100
<i>[Because she interpreted a conversation
she shouldn't have heard]</i>

190
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,290
<i>[68 percent chance]</i>

191
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,790
I knew it!
Damn it!

192
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
It was because she interpreted
confidential information.

193
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,400
Then... what did Park Kwan Soo
discuss with Abdul Omar?

194
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,790
<i>Unknown.</i>

195
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,990
Can't you find out somehow?

196
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,600
<i>I cannot make any
accurate assumptions.</i>

197
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,990
It's useless to keep asking

198
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,490
if she doesn't have any
information regarding that.

199
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,990
<i>- However.</i>
- However?

200
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,900
<i>What I can tell you is that two weeks
after the secret meeting between them</i>

201
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,700
<i>Abdul Omar broke free from the CIA's
control and created his own army.</i>

202
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,290
Maybe he gave him weapons?

203
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,490
If he did, that Park Kwan Soo
really is something else.

204
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I mean, that's quite
a favorable export deal for him.

205
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,490
What's going on?

206
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,900
This is 102. Where are you
going at this hour again?

207
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,100
This is J4.
I'm going to the store.

208
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,990
If you keep doing this, I'll have to
report it to the Situation Room.

Oh, come on. Don't do that.

210

coffee while you're there too, okay?

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400

- Yes.

218
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,790
Sure.

219
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,700
About that refugee woman
named Raniya...

220
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,700
You... loved her,
didn't you?

221
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,700
I don't know.

222
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,540
It was such a miserable
time in my life.

223
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,290
I don't know if I considered her my love
or just some useless sympathy source.

224
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,490
Useless?

225
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,100
She only started working
as an interpreter for Blackstone

226
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,400
because I introduced her to them.

227
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,900
Okay, then.
I'll get going now.

228
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,490
Where are you going?

229
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,990
To my place.

230
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,490
No need for that.

231
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,200
You're a "close line" now.

232
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,490
Go live in the JSS Residences instead.

233
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,290
It's fine.
I like where I'm staying now.

234
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:04,100
When someone in JSS
becomes a "close line"

235
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,290
that means I'm taking on
the responsibility of

236
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,200
protecting the well-being of that person
and their family from that point onward.

237
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,600
To me, that sounds like, "you're my
slave from this point onward."

238
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:25,700
I've never betrayed anyone
who's never betrayed me before.

239
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,990
There's no such thing as a master
who doesn't betray his or her slave.

240
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,100
People who don't betray
their friends do exist, though.

Oh, how could I have
known her personally?

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,400
She was a movie star, after all.

276
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,600
To be frank, your mother wasn't
the type of person

277
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,490
to be taking photos
at a studio like this.

278
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,290
She should've taken her photos
at a much nicer studio!

But on this day, she came to
get your passport photo taken

00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,490
and then suddenly said that
she wanted a family portrait done.

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,700
You even got a photo taken for
a U.S. visa back then, too.

Oh, and this is the last family
photo you took with this lady.

She was related to your mother.

I folded this photo for the frame,
so it looks like she's cropped out.

290
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,490

00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,790
You have to hurry!
Choi Yoo Jin knows everything now!

339
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,390
Run! She'll kill you and Anna!

340
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,600
You have to hurry!
Hurry and go!

341
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,790
Hurry and go!

342
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,290
Hurry.
Hurry.

343
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,290
That's right.
It's Choi Yoo Jin, isn't it?

344
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
You knew everything, didn't you?

345
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,290
You can't put that
much water in that.

346
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,500
Give me some soup.

347
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,790
Some soup, please.

348
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,100
Hye Rin.
Please, give me something to eat.

349
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,790
I'm so hungry.

350
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,790
Missus.

351
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,390
Give me some food.

352
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,100
Oh. Missus.
Missus!

353
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,390
Put a patrol car near
the front and back doors.

354
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,600
<i>We're going in now.</i>

355
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,500
<i>Make sure you block
all and any exits.</i>

356
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,290
Um, have you seen a person
who looks like this?

357
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,600
Oh, the one who came looking
for the patient in 101?

358
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,390
She went that way.

359
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,500
Go, J4.

360
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,600
This is J4.
The target is not here.

361
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,890
<i>Do a good sweep of the place!
She went that way!</i>

362
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,390
She's not in any of
the male patients' rooms.

363
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,000
Yes, Assemblyman?

364
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,290
I'm sorry. Yes.
We'll definitely find her.

365
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,190
What?

366
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,100
Yes, I understand.

367
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,290
Was that Assemblyman Jang?

368
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,890
So it looks like the news
reached him after all.

369
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,390
They couldn't even keep
quiet for that long.

370
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,690
So?
What did he say?

371
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,790
He said to make sure that she definitely
doesn't come to the Catholic church.

372
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:00,000
So he's more worried about
himself than he is about her.

373
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,600
Well, he is a politician, after all.

374
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,390
<i>Dad isn't that kind of person.</i>

375
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,390
<i>This is all because
Choi Yoo Jin is with him.</i>

376
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Here, give that to me, ma'am.
I'll hold it for you.

377
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,890
- Oh.
- Here, please take my hand.

378
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,000
- Wow, look at them.
- They're such nice people!

379
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,790
It's a steep walk, isn't it?

380
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,290
- Wow, who's that?
- Whoa.

381
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,100
Let us move this way.

382
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,790
- What a jerk!
- What's with that person?

383
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,390
- How rude!
- Unbelievable!

384
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,600
Assemblyman Park and Assemblyman Jang
are worlds apart, seriously!

385
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,190
- I know, right?
- What a jerk!

386
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,890
- That wasn't Assemblyman Park.
- Yes, it was!

387
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,790
- There we go.
- Watch your step.

388
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,890
<i>She's definitely somewhere near here.
Make sure to search high and low.</i>

389
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:18,000
<i>She mustn't get anywhere near
the VIP, no matter what.</i>

390
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,190
Oh, hello, sirs.

391
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,600
- Please, take a seat.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,790
Please, sit.

393
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,600
Let's see here.
Where's Jang Se Joon?

394
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,190
Over there.

395
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,690
Oh, so he's helping
someone in need, eh?

396
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,000
Thank you so much.

397
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,790
I'll leave your bag here, ma'am.

398
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,290
Hey, Assemblyman Jang!
Over here!

399
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,600
Come here!

400
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,790
Come on.
Get over here.

401
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,290
You too, Madam Choi.
There are seats here! Come!

402
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,100
- No, it's fine.
- Come on, man! Get over here!

403
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,290
Why are you being like that?
There are seats here!

404
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,690
Come on, get over here!

405
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,690
Geez.

406
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,290
- Please take a seat here.
- No, it's fine.

407
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,600
We'll go to the back.

408
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,790
Oh no, we couldn't allow that.
Please, take a seat.

409
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,600
- We're fine, so please sit here.
- No, it's all right!

410
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,290
Really, it's fine!
Please, don't!

411
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,890
- Oh my, thank you.
- Thank you! Thank you!

412
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,290
Looks like I shot myself in
the foot with that one.

413
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,600
Geez.

414
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,190
Today, nuns from
different nunneries

415
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:57,100
will be singing an offering song
to honor those who are deceased.

416
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,190
Dad.

417
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,600
Why is Anna...

418
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,500
<i>Dad.</i>

419
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,000
<i>With the nuns.</i>

420
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,290
<i>The target is among the nuns.</i>

421
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,600
I'll make a move.

422
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,100
No!

423
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,790
No!

424
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,500
<i>No, Anna!</i>

425
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,100
<i>- Stop her!</i>
- Right now?

426
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,600
<i>We don't have any other options!
Use force if necessary!</i>

427
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,390
<i>- If she even opens her mouth now--</i>
- Wait.

428
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,190
Oh, it seems that we have
one more offering song.

429
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:19,500
<i>Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound</i>

430
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:29,410
<i>that saved a wretch like me</i>.

431
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:42,930
<i>I once was lost,
but now am found</i>.

432
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:53,400
<i>Was blind, but now I see</i>.

433
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:06,290
<i>'Twas grace that taught
my heart to fear</i>

434
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:18,640
<i>and grace my fears relieved</i>.

435
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:46,040
<i>How precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed</i>.

436
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,100
Bravo!

443

No, it's nothing.

Wait!

445
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:39,390

446
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,000
<i>Please come and get me.</i>

<i>You know where I am, right?</i>

448
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,600
If the world finds out about Anna's
existence now, we'll be done for.

449
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,000
That's what I want to
say to you right now.

450
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,190
Just how did you go about
protecting this child

451
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,600
that something like this happened?

452
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,000
Shut it.

453
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,290
How about you think about
where she is first?

454
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,600
I told you, I don't know.

455
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,390
That child is waiting,
believing that you'll come for her.

456
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,100
And yet, you...

457
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,390
don't even know
where she may be?

458
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,600
How am I supposed to know?
It's been over 10 years already!

459
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:28,600
Anna is in a pathetic situation,
but even I feel sad.

460
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:34,600
To think that she believes that a father
like this will come looking for her!

461
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,190
Stop it, already.

462
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,790
What are you trying to do here?

463
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,600
Chief Joo.
Step out for a bit.

464
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,690
Yes, Madam.

465
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:01,290
On that day 14 years ago, the
last day I ever made breakfast for you...

466
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:09,390
if you'd kicked the door down and left
then, I wouldn't despise you this much.

467
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,690
I'm almost done with your breakfast.

If you leave this house now...

470
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,500
Anna will die too.

471
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:14,890
Then was I supposed to let
Anna die by your hand too?

472
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,190
Ugh, you murderer.

473
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,390
I thought so, too,
for all this time.

474
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,290
That you're doing this so that you could
protect Anna from my murderous rage.

475
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,790
But...

476
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,010
we both know the truth now.

477
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:45,500
You were just afraid that Anna would
get in the way of your ambition!

478
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,690
Well? Did you find out
where she might be?

479
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,000
Nope.

480
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,000
Search every person
coming out of the church!

481
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,190
Keep your minds sharp!

482
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,390
We have to find her
no matter what. You got that?

483
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,890
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

484
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:22,000
If this ends badly, it'll be
the end for all of us too!

485
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,390
- What? The Viking ride?
- That!

486
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,190
Oh no.

487
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,890
- She can't?
- No, I'm sorry.

488
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:52,190
I'm sorry, Anna.
You're just below the cut-off line.

489
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,890
You'll have to ride it next year, okay?

490
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,190
Dad! Hurry!
Over here!

491
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:15,390
Okay!
I got the ice cream!

492
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,000

- Anna.
- Hmm?

497
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:30,600
Do you know what to do if
you ever get lost at a place like this?

498
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
Take a cab!

499
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,120
And ask them to take me to the bus
stop for the 371 bus that goes to Jongro.

500
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,500
What?

501
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,600
Wow, you sure are smart, Anna.

502
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,690
I'm eight years old, you know, Dad.
That much is basic knowledge.

503
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:50,890
But what if you can't
take a cab, Anna?

504
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,740
Like, if you're abroad,
for example?

505
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:56,100
Then... I'll have to hurry
and find you, Dad.

506
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:09,290
Anna. If you keep going around looking
for me, I won't be able to find you.

507
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,790
That's true.
What should I do, then?

508
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:16,190
If that ever happens, wait for me at
the exact spot where you lost me.

509
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,290
- Really?
- Yeah.

510
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:23,000
No matter how scared you may get,
you have to withstand that and wait.

511
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,190
Then Daddy will come to where
you are, Anna, and find you.

512
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,500
Okay.
Got it.

513
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,690
I'll stay right there.

514
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,600
You have to come
and find me, okay?

515
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,390
Oh, of course!

516
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, I changed my number.

517
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,100
- It's crazy!
- You don't need to edit your photo.

518
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,600
I'll take a photo
and send it to you.

519
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,890
Okay.

520
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,890
- They want a photo?
- Yeah.

521
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,190
All right.
Wait, this side.

522
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,690
All right!

523
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
- Oh, it's so cute!
- What a great photo!

524
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,890
I've found her!

525
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,690
Really?

526
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,290
Oh, you're right.

527
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,100
Thank goodness.
We found her.

528
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,500
- Where is that?
- The Dream Forest.

529
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,100
- Hey, Team Leader Seo.
- What?

530
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,290
- I have a request.
- What? A request?

531
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,100
It's not a command?

532
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,190
No. It's a request.

533
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Here.

534
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,890
What about Dad?

535
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,190
Your dad is busy.
You know that.

536
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,290
I came here
because he sent me.

537
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,600
I'm telling you the truth!

538
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,390
How else would I have known to come
here if your dad didn't tell me?

539
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:01,190
Good job back there,
holding it in.

540
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,500
What did Dad say?

541
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,190
Your dad?
Well...

542
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,890
What did he say again?

543
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,000
He wants you to wait
a bit longer. And...

544
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,290
- when he becomes president...
- He wasn't mad?

545
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,600
That I just appeared
out of nowhere?

546
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,690
Mad?

547
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:28,890
Of course not.
He was just really worried.

548
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,290
Hey, hurry and take this.
It'll melt.

549
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,500
Your dad told me
to buy this for you.

550
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,600
Really?

551
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,190
So... Dad sent this to me?

552
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:46,690
Of course.

553
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:56,500
Okay. If it's from Dad,
I have to eat it.

554
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,290
It's good.

555
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:20,290
It's Team Leader Seo. Don't
get closer until K2 brings the VIP out.

556
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,290
Yes, sir.

557
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,790
Give me a status update.
What are they doing?

558
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,100
They're eating
ice cream together.

559
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,500
This used to be Dream Land.

560
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,890
And... it was my
mundo de ensueño (dream world).

561
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:55,000
It was the first amusement park
that I'd been to with Dad.

562
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,600
There was a scary
roller coaster there.

563
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,790
It would go all the way
up and back down.

564
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,890
But I was too young,
so I couldn't ride it.

565
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,190
To tell you the truth

566
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:13,000
the mere fact that I was at an amusement
park with Dad made me so happy.

567
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,190
Because I finally had something
to brag to my friends about.

568
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah. I'm sure that you must
have been really happy.

569
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:32,100
But... I couldn't brag. Because I
couldn't tell people who my dad was.

570
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:37,600
That's what my mom told me.

571
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:43,000
That my dad...
my dad...

572
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
was too powerful
of a person, so...

573
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,890
if people found out that
we were his family...

574
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,690
some bad guys would...

575
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,100
would harass my dad.

576
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,290
I didn't really know what
she meant back then, but..

577
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,790
but I was just scared...
of bad guys...

578
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:07,690
harassing my dad.

579
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:11,600
So... so I didn't say
anything, and held it in.

580
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,890
Hey, Anna.
Are you feeling ill?

581
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,500
It's a vana ilusión
(futile dream).

582
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,790
Anna, are you all right? Huh?

583
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,290
But now I know the truth.

584
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:35,000
That... that I was that
bad person all along.

585
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,690
Anna. What's the matter?

586
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:41,500
Huh? Anna!

587
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,190
This is K2!
Call an ambulance! Quick!

588
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,190
- What?
- Call an ambulance now!

589
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,000
Damn this guy.
Wait!

590
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,290
Anna, wake up!
Wake up, Anna!

591
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,890
What?
Strawberry ice cream?

592
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:09,790
Oh my gosh.
Oh no.

593
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,600
Anna has a severe strawberry allergy!

594
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,500
What?
A strawberry allergy?

595
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,600
<i>She could die even if
she eats only a little bit!</i>

596
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,890
It's because of the strawberries, punk!

597
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,290
She's allergic to them!

598
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,930
What? Strawberries?

599
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:30,100
<i>Really?
Dad sent this to me?</i>

600
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,100
<i>Of course.</i>

601
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,290
<i>It tastes good.</i>

602
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,790
<i>Does she still have a pulse?</i>

603
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:38,290
Yeah, she does.
But it's really weak.

604
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,290
<i>Damn it!</i>

605
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:43,190
<i>That means she's having trouble
breathing. Give her CPR until help comes!</i>

606
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:45,000
<i>If you don't, she'll die!</i>

607
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,790
Wake up, Anna!

608
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,500
Wake up, Anna!

609
