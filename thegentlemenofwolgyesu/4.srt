-  What?</font>

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,250
<font color="yellow">You're the thief.</font>

<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

8
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,250
<font color="yellow">It's you again.</font>

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,390
<font color="yellow">Did you follow me?</font>

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,550

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,350
<font color="yellow">Don't... Don't come near me.</font>

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,690
<font color="yellow">I'll call the police.</font>

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,990
<font color="yellow">Stay away.</font>

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,590
<font color="yellow">I said stay away!</font>

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,960
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,820
<font color="yellow">Let me say something, too.</font>

18
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,120
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,910
<font color="yellow">Why did you sneak in here like a little cat?</font>

20
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,250
<font color="yellow">What little cat?</font>

21
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,050
<font color="yellow">What more do you want to know about Gi Pyo, and why did you follow me?</font>

22
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,650
<font color="yellow">How long have you been tailing me?</font>

23
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,150
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm that bored? Why would I tail you, lady?</font>

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,510
<font color="yellow">Tell the truth before I call the police.</font>

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,620
<font color="yellow">What were you doing in someone else's store?</font>

26
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,420
<font color="yellow">This isn't someone else's store. It's mine.</font>

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,290
<font color="yellow">Is this store yours?</font>

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,990
<font color="yellow">I'm not getting through to you. I should call the police.</font>

29
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,150
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want. Call the police.</font>

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,970

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,250
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,990
<font color="yellow">I caught a thief.</font>

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,020
<font color="yellow">A thief?</font>

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,420
<font color="yellow">It's been a while. How are you?</font>

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,890
<font color="yellow">Fine, thanks.</font>

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,150
<font color="yellow">- He is Mr Lee's son.
-  What?</font>

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,730
<font color="yellow">Do you know her?</font>

39
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,450
<font color="yellow">Have you two never met?</font>

40
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,780
<font color="yellow">She works here.</font>

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,820
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,540
<font color="yellow">I should go, then.</font>

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,180
<font color="yellow">Your mother's having a hard time. Look after her.</font>

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,710
<font color="yellow">Call her often.</font>

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,290
<font color="yellow">I will. Bye.</font>

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,320
<font color="yellow">He's not at all like his father.</font>

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,000
<font color="yellow">He's a jerk. A scumbag.</font>

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,990
<font color="yellow">What happened between you two?</font>

49
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,890
<font color="yellow">It's a long story. I'll tell you on the way.</font>

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,260
<font color="yellow">Why did Dad hire such a useless woman?</font>

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,220
<font color="yellow">She isn't useless.</font>

53
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,830
<font color="yellow">People like her are rare these days.</font>

54
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,390
<font color="yellow">She respects her elders,</font>

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,650
<font color="yellow">she's good at her job and she works hard.</font>

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,220
<font color="yellow">Poo is the only thing she makes that's worth throwing out.</font>

57
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,580
<font color="yellow">Not at the table, Mum. That's gross.</font>

58
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,650
<font color="yellow">It's not gross.</font>

59
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,590
<font color="yellow">When will Yun Shil's husband get out of jail?</font>

60
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,980
<font color="yellow">It depends on the sentence.</font>

61
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,590
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about your dad,</font>

62
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,890
<font color="yellow">but my heart breaks when I think of Yun Shil.</font>

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,440
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't have married that man.</font>

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,450
<font color="yellow">Don't let your heart break.</font>

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,370
<font color="yellow">A hopeless romantic who'd give up a kidney...</font>

66
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,230
<font color="yellow">for the woman he loves is very rare.</font>

67
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,090
<font color="yellow">It's like a romantic novel.</font>

68
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,450
<font color="yellow">I'm so envious.</font>

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,410
<font color="yellow">You're stupid for being so, then.</font>

70
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,250
<font color="yellow">The scoundrel used that to lure...</font>

71
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,590
<font color="yellow">poor Yun Shil into marrying him.</font>

72
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,950
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. What a day.</font>

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,390
<font color="yellow">Silly me. I'm supposed to give the grapes to Ms Choi.</font>

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,420
<font color="yellow">What a waste.</font>

75
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,350
<font color="yellow">Too bad.</font>

76
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,660
<font color="yellow">I'll eat it, then.</font>

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,660
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,250
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,630
<font color="yellow">They're from my mother-in-law.</font>

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,950
<font color="yellow">I wasn't able to bring much, but I hope you enjoy it.</font>

81
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,020
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

82
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,080
<font color="yellow">Come in for dinner if you haven't eaten yet.</font>

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,660
<font color="yellow">It's late. I should go.</font>

84
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,750
<font color="yellow">Come in, Yun Shil.</font>

85
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,690
<font color="yellow">I think you have a guest. I'll come by tomorrow.</font>

86
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,370
<font color="yellow">He isn't a guest. He's my son. Come on inside.</font>

87
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,390
<font color="yellow">Come in and eat.</font>

88
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,490
<font color="yellow">- But...
-  Come on.</font>

89
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,120
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

90
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,570
<font color="yellow">Come on. Get inside.</font>

91
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,590
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

92
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,150
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

93
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,220
<font color="yellow">Have some dinner.</font>

94
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,440
<font color="yellow">- Come and sit.
-  No thanks.</font>

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,190
<font color="yellow">Sit down already.</font>

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,070
<font color="yellow">I already ate at home.</font>

97
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,690
<font color="yellow">You were put to work under the summer sun.</font>

98
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,590
<font color="yellow">You got a tan already.</font>

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,240
<font color="yellow">Did you work the whole weekend?</font>

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,940
<font color="yellow">No. My mother-in-law is sweet. She let me take a long rest.</font>

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,450
<font color="yellow">I saw her in person at the wedding.</font>

102
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,590
<font color="yellow">I don't believe you.</font>

103
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,350
<font color="yellow">The grapes are lovely and sweet.</font>

104
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,320
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some?
-  No thanks.</font>

105
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,180
<font color="yellow">I hate grapes.</font>

106
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,890
<font color="yellow">Why? They're nice.</font>

107
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,790
<font color="yellow">You two haven't met, have you?</font>

108
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,450
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

109
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,950
<font color="yellow">He's my parents' pride and joy. He's my little brother Lee Dong Jin.</font>

110
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,120
<font color="yellow">She's Na Yun Shil, and she works at the store.</font>

111
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,420
<font color="yellow">Now that I said hello, I think I should go.</font>

112
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,790
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

113
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,020
<font color="yellow">I'm tired. I'd like to go to bed early.</font>

114
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,650
<font color="yellow">Bye. Good night.</font>

115
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,150
<font color="yellow">That was terribly loud.</font>

116
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,080
<font color="yellow">Is your forehead okay?</font>

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,850
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's fine.</font>

118
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,250
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Yun Shil, what's wrong with you?</font>

119
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,820
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

120
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,750
<font color="yellow">Of course I am. I have a really hard skull.</font>

121
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,160
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with her?
-  Does she have heatstroke?</font>

122
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,290
<font color="yellow">How stupid.</font>

123
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,350
<font color="yellow">Why did I have to bash my head?</font>

124
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,290
<font color="yellow">I'm so stupid.</font>

125
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,820
<font color="yellow">Is anyone in?</font>

126
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,650
<font color="yellow">Hello. Is this Lee Man Sool's residence?</font>

127
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

128
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,310
<font color="yellow">Have you found him?</font>

129
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, we have, but...</font>

130
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,730
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, Dong Sook, come outside.</font>

131
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,790
<font color="yellow">The policemen are here.</font>

132
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,350
<font color="yellow">They found Mr Lee.</font>

133
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,930
<font color="yellow">Are you... Are you serious?</font>

134
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,590
<font color="yellow">At last. Thank you so much. Thank goodness.</font>

135
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,220
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

136
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,330
<font color="yellow">Because Mr Lee is quite old,</font>

137
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,010
<font color="yellow">we had to consider the fact that he could be senile.</font>

138
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,530
<font color="yellow">So we put him on a list...</font>

139
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,240
<font color="yellow">and kept trying to contact him while trying to trace his whereabouts.</font>

140
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,820
<font color="yellow">Stop trying to explain everything.</font>

141
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,540
<font color="yellow">Get to the point.</font>

142
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,250
<font color="yellow">Where is my father right now?</font>

143
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,620
<font color="yellow">Was he in an accident?</font>

144
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,720
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
<font color="yellow">He's in good health.</font>

146
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,020
<font color="yellow">It's just that he expressed his wishes that...</font>

147
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,090
<font color="yellow">we don't tell you where he is.</font>

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,250
<font color="yellow">He only asked us to give you this letter.</font>

149
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

150
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,920
<font color="yellow">He asked us to cancel the missing person's report.</font>

151
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,150
<font color="yellow">We gave you the letter, so that's our job done.</font>

152
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,150
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  Bye.</font>

153
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,010
<font color="yellow">What was all that?</font>

154
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,780
<font color="yellow">Read the letter, Dong Sook.</font>

155
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,520
<font color="yellow">What? Okay.</font>

156
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,850
<font color="yellow">"My dear partner Gok Ji."</font>

157
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,120
<font color="yellow">You must have been very surprised.</font>

158
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

159
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,590
<font color="yellow">You have nothing to worry about.</font>

160
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,650
<font color="yellow">I am healthy and well.</font>

161
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,020
<font color="yellow">I have no complaints other than that I miss you.</font>

162
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,090
<font color="yellow">So please stop trying to look for me.</font>

163
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,620
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook and Dong Jin.</font>

164
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,390
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving your mother under your care.</font>

165
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,290
<font color="yellow">Care for her well.</font>

166
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,260
<font color="yellow">Even animals, when they sense their end is near,</font>

167
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,820
<font color="yellow">leave the flock to spend time alone.</font>

168
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,590
<font color="yellow">I am human.</font>

169
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,350
<font color="yellow">I am almost 80.</font>

170
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,690
<font color="yellow">I need some time to look back on my life...</font>

171
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,950
<font color="yellow">and plan and prepare for the future.</font>

172
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,590
<font color="yellow">I am saddened that no one will inherit the family business,</font>

173
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,650
<font color="yellow">but I believe that also is a part of life.</font>

174
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,990
<font color="yellow">I do not blame you. However,</font>

175
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,990
<font color="yellow">I cannot close the business myself.</font>

176
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
<font color="yellow">As I said in my previous letter,</font>

177
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,020
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, I want you to close the store.</font>

178
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,320
<font color="yellow">If you were to do that for me,</font>

179
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,620
<font color="yellow">that would relieve at least a little of the guilt I feel...</font>

180
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,950
<font color="yellow">towards my ancestors.</font>

181
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,690
<font color="yellow">Do that for me.</font>

182
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,080
<font color="yellow">"Do not worry about me."</font>

183
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,670
<font color="yellow">"Do your best in whatever you do in the future."</font>

184
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,290
<font color="yellow">"I will return soon."</font>

185
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,970
<font color="yellow">- Ms Choi.
-  Mum.</font>

186
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,020
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

187
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,690
<font color="yellow">He said he is fine.</font>

188
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,990
<font color="yellow">Let's not worry about him any more.</font>

189
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,350
<font color="yellow">Call the real estate agent tomorrow.</font>

190
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,990
<font color="yellow">Let's sell the store.</font>

191
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,320
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
-  Take my hand.</font>

192
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,760
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Mum.</font>

193
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,600
<font color="yellow">He must have a good reason for doing this.</font>

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,710
<font color="yellow">I know Mr Lee. He wouldn't do this for no reason.</font>

195
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,890
<font color="yellow">It's a family matter.</font>

196
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,620
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

197
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,190
<font color="yellow">Something isn't right.</font>

198
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,520
<font color="yellow">Let's see...</font>

199
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,940
<font color="yellow">So you smashed this man's guitar.</font>

200
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,320
<font color="yellow">I didn't smash it.</font>

201
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,250
<font color="yellow">It got smashed when he fell over.</font>

202
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,550
<font color="yellow">You punched me and caused me to fall over.</font>

203
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,520
<font color="yellow">That's how it got smashed.</font>

204
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
<font color="yellow">I just remembered.</font>

205
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,680
<font color="yellow">Add assault to the list of charges.</font>

206
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
<font color="yellow">No one hit him.</font>

207
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,520
<font color="yellow">He did all the falling over on his own.</font>

208
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,490
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, lady. You weren't even there.</font>

209
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,560
<font color="yellow">- Did you hit him?
-  I did not.</font>

210
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,890
<font color="yellow">It was just a graze.</font>

211
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,020
<font color="yellow">A graze?</font>

212
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,620
<font color="yellow">Are you Mike Tyson? You punched me square in the face.</font>

213
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,020
<font color="yellow">Get to the point.</font>

214
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,190
<font color="yellow">Will you press charges?</font>

215
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,890
<font color="yellow">If you insist on doing so,</font>

216
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,580
<font color="yellow">you will be sued for trespassing,</font>

217
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,180
<font color="yellow">not paying for food... and refusing to leave.</font>

218
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,330
<font color="yellow">Even if Mr Bae agrees to settle,</font>

219
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,020
<font color="yellow">all those criminal charges will go on your record.</font>

220
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,950
<font color="yellow">And you'll be charged with property damage and assault.</font>

221
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,820
<font color="yellow">Even if Mr Sung settles, you'll be punished, too.</font>

222
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,350
<font color="yellow">Do you still want to press charges?</font>

223
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,890
<font color="yellow">What's the punishment?</font>

224
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,130
<font color="yellow">It could be a fine or a stint in jail.</font>

225
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,190
<font color="yellow">That's up to the prosecutor and judge.</font>

226
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,250
<font color="yellow">- Jail?
-  Jail?</font>

227
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,490
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

228
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,630
<font color="yellow">Let's do as the policeman said.</font>

229
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,240
<font color="yellow">Let's not make things any worse.</font>

230
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,290
<font color="yellow">We can each take a step back and compromise.</font>

231
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,690
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Deal.</font>

232
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,720
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

233
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,610
<font color="yellow">I get that the guitar means a lot to you.</font>

234
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,810
<font color="yellow">I get that.</font>

235
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,690
<font color="yellow">People like us live from day-to-day. 2,000 dollars is a huge sum.</font>

236
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,650
<font color="yellow">- 1,500 dollars.
-  No way. 500.</font>

237
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,940
<font color="yellow">500 dollars? For a guitar like that?</font>

238
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,430
<font color="yellow">I won't pay you any more.</font>

239
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,520
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

240
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,580
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

241
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,810
<font color="yellow">If we can't settle, we have to go to court.</font>

242
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,250
<font color="yellow">Do you think that scares me?</font>

243
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,120
<font color="yellow">Will you both calm down?</font>

244
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,920
<font color="yellow">Take a step back, both of you.</font>

245
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,520
<font color="yellow">1,000 dollars.</font>

246
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,420
<font color="yellow">- Deal.
-  Okay. You?</font>

247
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,330
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  We have a deal.</font>

248
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,550
<font color="yellow">- We're good, right?
-  20-month instalments.</font>

249
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,150
<font color="yellow">You want to pay me over 20 months?</font>

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,020
<font color="yellow">50 dollars a month.</font>

251
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,260
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

252
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,650
<font color="yellow">I can't deal with her. She lacks common sense.</font>

253
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,710
<font color="yellow">People like her are really rare.</font>

254
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,130
<font color="yellow">You stole the words out of my mouth.</font>

255
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,200
<font color="yellow">You're taking a grand from us over a guitar.</font>

256
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,420
<font color="yellow">You're worse than...</font>

257
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,750
<font color="yellow">Kim Seon Dal, a conman who sold the Han River.</font>

258
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,320
<font color="yellow">That was the Daedong River, not the Han. You're so ignorant.</font>

259
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,350
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm ignorant.</font>

260
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,190
<font color="yellow">I didn't finish high school.</font>

261
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,780
<font color="yellow">What do you care?</font>

262
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,070
<font color="yellow">There you go again.</font>

263
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,180
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying that?</font>

264
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,380
<font color="yellow">- That has nothing to do with me.
-  Calm down, both of you.</font>

265
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,690
<font color="yellow">We were doing so well.</font>

266
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,850
<font color="yellow">I am trying to be very neutral and objective here.</font>

267
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,450
<font color="yellow">Take one more step back.</font>

268
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,720
<font color="yellow">We'll pay you 100 dollars a month for 10 months.</font>

269
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,780
<font color="yellow">Deal. I'm sick of dealing with her.</font>

270
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,270
<font color="yellow">Let's end it all here.</font>

271
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,020
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
-  Thank you so much.</font>

272
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,650
<font color="yellow">You said what I wanted to. It's a deal.</font>

273
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,920
<font color="yellow">Perfect. Give us your account number and we're done.</font>

274
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,450
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  My gosh.</font>

275
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,520
<font color="yellow">Let's not meet again, even by chance.</font>

276
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,190
<font color="yellow">Let's not.</font>

277
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,750
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

278
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,390
<font color="yellow">Okay. What then?</font>

279
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

280
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,350
<font color="yellow">- You called a real estate agent?
-  Yes.</font>

281
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,810
<font color="yellow">Mum's so angry that she wants nothing to do with the store.</font>

282
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,650
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't get so emotional.</font>

283
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,010
<font color="yellow">Can you put your mother on?</font>

284
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,020
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

285
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,900
<font color="yellow">Mum, do you want to talk to Sam Do?</font>

286
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,290
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

287
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,890
<font color="yellow">She said no.</font>

288
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,630
<font color="yellow">She's too weak to answer the phone.</font>

289
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,720
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that Mr Lee's well.</font>

290
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,420
<font color="yellow">Forget about the real estate agent.</font>

291
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,890
<font color="yellow">Let's talk again soon. Bye.</font>

292
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,330
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

293
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

294
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,470
<font color="yellow">- Mr Park from the gas station.
-  What is it now?</font>

295
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,150
<font color="yellow">His in-laws keep suits... They keep bees.</font>

296
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,120
<font color="yellow">He asked if we need honey.</font>

297
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,120
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

298
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,450
<font color="yellow">- 50 dollars per bottle.
-  That's too expensive!</font>

299
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,520
<font color="yellow">So I said no.</font>

300
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,980
<font color="yellow">- Why is it so expensive?
-  What is?</font>

301
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,850
<font color="yellow">Other places serve 200g per portion.</font>

302
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,020
<font color="yellow">Here, they only give you 150g.</font>

303
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,730
<font color="yellow">Where's the manager?</font>

304
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,210
<font color="yellow">Can you please just let go on a day like this?</font>

305
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,290
<font color="yellow">Let's just eat.</font>

306
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,650
<font color="yellow">Why is today special?</font>

307
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,020
<font color="yellow">Why isn't is special?</font>

308
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,320
<font color="yellow">We finally settled the terrifying guitar case.</font>

309
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,200
<font color="yellow">I still think 1,000 dollars is way too much,</font>

310
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,020
<font color="yellow">but you seemed so stressed.</font>

311
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,990
<font color="yellow">That's why I said yes. Just to get rid of the guy.</font>

312
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,290
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

313
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,550
<font color="yellow">You really are a warrior.</font>

314
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,550
<font color="yellow">You'll...</font>

315
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,550
<font color="yellow">do just fine without me, won't you?</font>

316
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,590
<font color="yellow">Be honest. You saved up quite a bit, haven't you?</font>

317
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,520
<font color="yellow">I don't have any money.</font>

318
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,790
<font color="yellow">You say that, but I know you do.</font>

319
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,820
<font color="yellow">You'll do just fine without me, as long as you have that.</font>

320
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,850
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

321
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,250
<font color="yellow">I heard you'll run for president for the market committee.</font>

322
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,720
<font color="yellow">People keep saying I should.</font>

323
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,430
<font color="yellow">I don't have a choice.</font>

324
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,640
<font color="yellow">If you actually get elected as president,</font>

325
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
<font color="yellow">you'll have a lot of influence.</font>

326
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,220
<font color="yellow">You'll do just fine without me, won't you?</font>

327
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,990
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

328
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,590
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  Then why...</font>

329
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,990
<font color="yellow">do you keep saying I'll do fine without you?</font>

330
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,460
<font color="yellow">I'm just trying to express...</font>

331
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,420
<font color="yellow">what an incredible person you are.</font>

332
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

333
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,730
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

334
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,850
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

335
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,090
<font color="yellow">Where's Tae Yang?</font>

336
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,120
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. A college friend got hurt.</font>

337
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,160
<font color="yellow">Badly hurt?</font>

338
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,290
<font color="yellow">No. It was a fender bender.</font>

339
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,810
<font color="yellow">He needed a guardian.</font>

340
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,470
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, he's fine.</font>

341
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,350
<font color="yellow">It's time for your medication.</font>

342
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,120
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

343
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,460
<font color="yellow">"All the work."</font>

344
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,500
<font color="yellow">He had to do everything.</font>

345
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,900
<font color="yellow">Let's move on to the next sentence.</font>

346
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,250
<font color="yellow">"Recently" means not so long ago.</font>

347
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,650
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

348
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,480
<font color="yellow">You need to get your hair and makeup done for the interview.</font>

349
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,350
<font color="yellow">You paid for my classes, too.</font>

350
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,490
<font color="yellow">I owe you so much.</font>

351
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,850
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that I can't do more.</font>

352
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,120
<font color="yellow">If you find a job first, don't find another girlfriend.</font>

353
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,590
<font color="yellow">I would never do that.</font>

354
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,270
<font color="yellow">You might, though.</font>

355
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,290
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

356
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,590
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is KBC News.</font>

357
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,130
<font color="yellow">Loneliness can lead to...</font>

358
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,120
<font color="yellow">Mum, what do you think about her?</font>

359
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
<font color="yellow">She has a pretty common face.</font>

360
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,480
<font color="yellow">She does not. Take a closer look.</font>

361
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,490
<font color="yellow">She has class and looks intellectual.</font>

362
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,390
<font color="yellow">Do you like her?</font>

363
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,000
<font color="yellow">I think you're already working on her.</font>

364
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,650
<font color="yellow">Why? Can't I?</font>

365
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,720
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

366
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,130
<font color="yellow">You're the CEO of Meesa Apparel.</font>

367
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,850
<font color="yellow">You need to upgrade your standard accordingly.</font>

368
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,990
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, welcome home.</font>

369
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,490
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

370
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

371
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,690
<font color="yellow">I'll go upstairs.</font>

372
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,320
<font color="yellow">You came out to welcome your husband.</font>

373
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,120
<font color="yellow">That's a change. I find it perplexing.</font>

374
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,490
<font color="yellow">- Me, too.
-  It's a personal matter.</font>

375
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,570
<font color="yellow">I guess they reconciled. I'm so glad they did.</font>

376
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,930
<font color="yellow">They shouldn't be getting along at a time like this.</font>

377
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,550
<font color="yellow">Something's off.</font>

378
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

379
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,920
<font color="yellow">Will it all work out?</font>

380
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,780
<font color="yellow">Will you become president again?</font>

381
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,020
<font color="yellow">Did you call my mum?</font>

382
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,760
<font color="yellow">I forgot. I'll call her tomorrow.</font>

383
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,180
<font color="yellow">You should visit her.</font>

384
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,620
<font color="yellow">Why should I? Can't I just call her?</font>

385
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,190
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll pay her a visit.</font>

386
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,900
<font color="yellow">Shall I run a bath?</font>

387
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,690
<font color="yellow">No. I have some reports to read. Go to bed.</font>

388
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,990
<font color="yellow">Why did his dad leave home and cause this mess?</font>

389
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,550
<font color="yellow">I've had enough of this.</font>

390
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,960
<font color="yellow">Meesa Apparel dropped the libel charges...</font>

391
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,690
<font color="yellow">and handed in a petition asking for leniency...</font>

392
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,720
<font color="yellow">stating the fraud was just a misunderstanding.</font>

393
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,460
<font color="yellow">He'll get off lightly.</font>

394
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,890
<font color="yellow">The CEO really did take the matter into his own hands.</font>

395
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,440
<font color="yellow">Can you meet the lawyer Hong Gi Pyo hired?</font>

396
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,420
<font color="yellow">I can, but we won't get anywhere.</font>

397
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,690
<font color="yellow">It's Choi Cheol Woo, Madam Ko's personal lawyer.</font>

398
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,150
<font color="yellow">How could she use him for a case like this?</font>

399
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,880
<font color="yellow">It's like admitting she's behind it.</font>

400
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,350
<font color="yellow">It is, but they don't really have any evidence yet.</font>

401
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,420
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks.</font>

402
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,190
<font color="yellow">It would all go well...</font>

403
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,550
<font color="yellow">if that lady convinces her husband.</font>

404
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,950
<font color="yellow">Which way did he go?</font>

405
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,590
<font color="yellow">- Hong Gi Pyo...
-  I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

406
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,790
<font color="yellow">Get her out of here.
-  Please.</font>

407
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,190
<font color="yellow">Thief!</font>

408
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,590
<font color="yellow">Stay away.</font>

409
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,120
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

410
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,620
<font color="yellow">I had no idea who he was.</font>

411
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,190
<font color="yellow">How am I going to face him now?</font>

412
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,240
<font color="yellow">For an old store in an old building,</font>

413
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,110
<font color="yellow">it's well-maintained and in a nice spot.</font>

414
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,890
<font color="yellow">I want it over and done with soon. Sell it as soon as possible.</font>

415
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,130
<font color="yellow">Can you please reconsider?</font>

416
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,940
<font color="yellow">You can't sell the store while Mr Lee's away.</font>

417
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,570
<font color="yellow">You were there when Dong Sook read his letter.</font>

418
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,220
<font color="yellow">Get over it, both of you, and find another job. Be smart.</font>

419
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,320
<font color="yellow">She's really upset.</font>

420
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,150
<font color="yellow">I'll sell it off as soon as possible.</font>

421
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
<font color="yellow">Please do.</font>

422
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,720
<font color="yellow">Look who's here.</font>

423
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,280
<font color="yellow">You look familiar.</font>

424
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,320
<font color="yellow">Don't be so sarcastic.</font>

425
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,090
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

426
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,800
<font color="yellow">Fine, thanks.</font>

427
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,530
<font color="yellow">- I have a lot of people to meet.
-  Dong Jin's wife.</font>

428
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,000
<font color="yellow">I also do a lot of charity work.</font>

429
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,060
<font color="yellow">I was too busy to visit you.</font>

430
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,280
<font color="yellow">Please understand.</font>

431
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,680
<font color="yellow">I bet you were busy spending money.</font>

432
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,850
<font color="yellow">You didn't do any charity.</font>

433
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,020
<font color="yellow">Have you decided to sell the store?</font>

434
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  I'm so glad you did.</font>

435
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,420
<font color="yellow">Who would buy a suit at a rundown old store?</font>

436
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,760
<font color="yellow">Now that Father's gone, sell the store right away...</font>

437
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,180
<font color="yellow">and spend the rest of your life traveling.</font>

438
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,090
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

439
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,840
<font color="yellow">"A rundown old store"?</font>

440
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,660
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

441
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,810
<font color="yellow">No one goes to a store like this these days.</font>

442
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,580
<font color="yellow">They can get an Italian suit for the same price.</font>

443
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,580
<font color="yellow">What do you know about suits?</font>

444
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,610
<font color="yellow">Even foreigners acknowledge the quality of my dad's suits.</font>

445
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,850
<font color="yellow">It's not just a luxury item. It's a work of art.</font>

446
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,110
<font color="yellow">Come on, Dong Sook. A suit is just a suit.</font>

447
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,420
<font color="yellow">"Just a suit"?</font>

448
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,420
<font color="yellow">- Watch what you say.
-  Let it go, Dong Sook.</font>

449
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,260
<font color="yellow">I have a headache.</font>

450
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,490
<font color="yellow">Get her out of here right now.</font>

451
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,110
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

452
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,440
<font color="yellow">My dad's been gone for days, and you finally come by?</font>

453
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,790
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo, you need to learn some manners.</font>

454
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,650
<font color="yellow">I should just...</font>

455
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,900
<font color="yellow">- beat her up.
-  Dong Sook.</font>

456
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,120
<font color="yellow">I was only being honest. What's her problem?</font>

457
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,420
<font color="yellow">Was that such a huge mistake?</font>

458
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,590
<font color="yellow">Goodness, I should just die so that I don't have to deal with this mess.</font>

459
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,280
<font color="yellow">- Calm down.
-  Gosh, let go of me.</font>

460
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,290

<font color="yellow">I'm even ready to get a divorce.</font>

910
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,120
<font color="yellow">I can't just go back now.</font>

911
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,520
<font color="yellow">If Mr Lee hears that I'm back and running the tailor shop again,</font>

912
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,860
<font color="yellow">he will return as soon as possible.</font>

913
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it.</font>

914
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,350
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

915
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,990
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

916
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,320
<font color="yellow">I agree with him.</font>

917
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,550
<font color="yellow">If we open the tailor shop again, Mr Lee will definitely return.</font>

918
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,700
<font color="yellow">You haven't had a real job since graduating from university.</font>

919
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,350
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you found a job yet?</font>

920
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,450
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's the guy who gave Ji Yun the watch.</font>

921
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:47,750
<font color="yellow">(Tae Joon)</font>

922
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, Tae Joon. What's up?</font>

923
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,990
<font color="yellow">Mum's in the hospital.</font>

924
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,960
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

925
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,150
<font color="yellow">She hurt her legs real bad when she fell yesterday.</font>

926
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,970
<font color="yellow">She's ruptured ligaments and injured the cartilage in her knees.</font>

927
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,000
<font color="yellow">The doctor says she needs surgery.</font>

928
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,120
<font color="yellow">She told me not to tell you,</font>

929
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,600
<font color="yellow">but I can't deal with this on my own.</font>

930
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,860
<font color="yellow">It was good of you to call. Don't worry too much.</font>

931
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,780
<font color="yellow">Get her to take the surgery right away.</font>

932
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,790
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the money.</font>

933
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

934
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:29,150
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee paid me in advance, so I got some money to spare.</font>

935
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,290
<font color="yellow">It should cover the surgery.</font>

936
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,320
<font color="yellow">Don't thank me. What are friends for?</font>

937
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:39,990
<font color="yellow">Come over, I'm at Mr Lee's place.</font>

938
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,590
<font color="yellow">It should be around here.</font>

939
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, there it is.</font>

940
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:23,650
<font color="yellow">The change...</font>

941
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,750
<font color="yellow">is yours.</font>

942
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:28,990
<font color="yellow">Salute!</font>

943
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:45,520
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

944
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,220
<font color="yellow">I think I was out of line yesterday.</font>

945
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

946
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,020
<font color="yellow">I'm here, Mum.</font>

947
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,490
<font color="yellow">What? He's going to ignore me?</font>

948
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,300
<font color="yellow">Is anyone home?</font>

949
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,390
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

950
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,950
<font color="yellow">Oh, who do we have here?</font>

951
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,620
<font color="yellow">You're the bride who didn't pay me.</font>

952
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, the money... I'll...</font>

953
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,420
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm here for today.</font>

954
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,350
<font color="yellow">Do you live here?</font>

955
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,750
<font color="yellow">No, my boss does.</font>

956
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,520
<font color="yellow">Does Lee Dong Sook live here?</font>

957
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,840
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see her?</font>

958
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,890
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

959
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,020
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, you have a guest.</font>

960
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,420
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sung Jun.</font>

961
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,450
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

962
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,210
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

963
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:38,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's my home. We have empty rooms upstairs.</font>

964
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,950
<font color="yellow">I like the place.</font>

965
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,220
<font color="yellow">Could I take a look at it first?</font>

966
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,690
<font color="yellow">Of course, Sung Jun.</font>

967
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,220
<font color="yellow">After you.</font>

968
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,260
<font color="yellow">What's going on with her?</font>

969
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:57,760
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook. Prepare some nice cereal smoothies for us.</font>

970
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,420
<font color="yellow">I'll get it for you instead.</font>

971
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,390
<font color="yellow">Lee Man Sool.</font>

972
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,150
<font color="yellow">This is the place.</font>

973
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,790
<font color="yellow">(Rooms available for lease)</font>

974
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,190
<font color="yellow">You just wait right there.</font>

975
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,550
<font color="yellow">There are two rooms and a big living room.</font>

976
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,130
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be enough for you to live alone.</font>

977
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,620
<font color="yellow">This is more than enough.</font>

978
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,590
<font color="yellow">I bet the monthly rent is pretty expensive.</font>

979
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,150
<font color="yellow">It's not for monthly rent. It's for lease.</font>

980
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,750
<font color="yellow">Lease?</font>

981
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,590
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

982
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,460
<font color="yellow">- 10 thousand dollars?
-  My goodness.</font>

983
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,870
<font color="yellow">You've been out of the country for too long.</font>

984
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,490
<font color="yellow">You don't know how things are around here, do you?</font>

985
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,220
<font color="yellow">It's not 10 thousand. It's 100 thousand dollars.</font>

986
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,390
<font color="yellow">100 thousand dollars?</font>

987
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,150
<font color="yellow">We can't keep the shop closed.</font>

988
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,220
<font color="yellow">It's not like we can let other people...</font>

989
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:06,530
<font color="yellow">Where did Dong Sook run off to?</font>

990
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,190
<font color="yellow">She has a guest over.</font>

991
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,920
<font color="yellow">Come on out, Bae Sam Do.</font>

992
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,880
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

993
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,150
<font color="yellow">I think she just called your name.</font>

994
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,620
<font color="yellow">Don't you hear me?</font>

995
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,190
<font color="yellow">Where are you, Bae Sam Do?</font>

996
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:26,820
<font color="yellow">Get me Bae Sam Do right now.</font>

997
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,720
<font color="yellow">Isn't that your wife?</font>

998
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's driving me crazy.</font>

999
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,390
<font color="yellow">I guess Sam Do's wife followed him all the way here.</font>

1000
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,720
<font color="yellow">She's going to make quite a scene. What should we do?</font>

1001
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,610
<font color="yellow">Let's go out there.</font>

1002
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,620
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1003
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

1004
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,850
<font color="yellow">Is she crazy? Get down from there.</font>

1005
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:11,690
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1006
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,490
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

1007
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,200
<font color="yellow">Have you been drinking?</font>

1008
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,690
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1009
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:22,450
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was going to go insane...</font>

1010
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,820
<font color="yellow">without alcohol.</font>

1011
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,010
<font color="yellow">So I had three cartons of soju on the train.</font>

1012
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:33,150
<font color="yellow">Three cartons? You're making me insane.</font>

1013
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,970
<font color="yellow">This is a noisy neighbourhood. What's going on?</font>

1014
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:38,990
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1015
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
-  What's she doing up there?</font>

1016
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,820
<font color="yellow">What? It's you again.</font>

1017
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,620
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

1018
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,760
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Do you guys know each other?</font>

1019
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,790
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1020
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,950
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What are you doing up there?</font>

1021
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,650
<font color="yellow">Stop embarrassing me and get down from there.</font>

1022
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:15,820
<font color="yellow">Promise me that you'll go back to Daejeon with me then.</font>

1023
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,690
<font color="yellow">Then I'll go down.</font>

1024
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,470
<font color="yellow">I told you. I'm going to start working at the tailor shop again.</font>

1025
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,620
<font color="yellow">Then that'll be the end of the both of us.</font>

1026
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,460
<font color="yellow">- What's she doing?
-  My gosh.</font>

1027
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,750
<font color="yellow">Do you know what this is?</font>

1028
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,190
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

1029
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,020
<font color="yellow">Isn't that fuel?</font>

1030
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,390
<font color="yellow">You got that right.</font>

1031
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:42,090
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do with that?</font>

1032
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,660
<font color="yellow">You know what I'm going to do.</font>

1033
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:48,250
<font color="yellow">I'm going to put myself on fire.</font>

1034
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,990
<font color="yellow">She's a woman of her words. Nobody will be able to stop her.</font>

1035
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,450
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

1036
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,190
<font color="yellow">I'll go up there.</font>

1037
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,250
<font color="yellow">Don't let anyone up here.</font>

1038
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:05,390
<font color="yellow">If you do,</font>

1039
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:09,750
<font color="yellow">I'll use this lighter.</font>

1040
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:11,520
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my goodness.
-  Gosh.</font>

1041
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,540
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
-  What's going on?</font>

1042
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,650
<font color="yellow">Well, the thing is...</font>

1043
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,650
<font color="yellow">It's hard to explain.</font>

1044
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,350
<font color="yellow">This is your last chance.</font>

1045
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:27,890
<font color="yellow">Bae Sam Do. Are you going back with me or not?</font>

1046
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,020
<font color="yellow">Stop making me repeat what I said.</font>

1047
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,090
<font color="yellow">I'm not going back!</font>

1048
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,620
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1049
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:37,390
<font color="yellow">We all die then.</font>

1050
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,820
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no.
-  Stop it.</font>

1051
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,720
<font color="yellow">Don't do it.</font>

1052
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:52,720
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, are you crazy?</font>

1053
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,120
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, don't be so emotional.</font>

1054
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,620
<font color="yellow">Let's talk this out.</font>

1055
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:03,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sick and tired of talking.</font>

1056
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,350
<font color="yellow">I've had enough.</font>

1057
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,020
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that lady?</font>

1058
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:11,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not exactly sure what's going on, either.</font>

1059
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,020
<font color="yellow">This is not looking good. Call 911.</font>

1060
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,790
