1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,239
<font color="yellow">A long time ago, a boy loved a mermaid</font>

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,949
<font color="yellow">and heard her voice.</font>

3
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:18,379
<font color="yellow">Am I... that boy?</font>

4
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:23,939
<font color="yellow">He was the boy who loved the mermaid and heard her voice.</font>

5
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,009
<font color="yellow">But he didn't know one important thing.</font>

6
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:33,149
<font color="yellow">That mermaids have a special ability.</font>

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,880
<font color="yellow">That she can erase herself from a human's memories with a kiss.</font>

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,760
<font color="yellow">Even if you erase my memories over and over...</font>

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,210
<font color="yellow">Even if he's born in a different world,</font>

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,510
<font color="yellow">he is a boy whose fate is to love the mermaid again.</font>

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,300
<font color="yellow">Please save me.</font>

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,530
<font color="yellow">Argh!</font>

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,340
<font color="yellow">I'm also different.</font>

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,910
<font color="yellow">- Heo Joon Jae... <br>- If he knows I'm different,</font>

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,000
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae will probably hate me, right? He'll probably leave me, right?</font>

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,349
<font color="yellow">Don't come, Heo Joon Jae!</font>

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,700
<font color="yellow">My secret is that I'm different from you.</font>

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,680
<font color="yellow">That I'm a mermaid.</font>

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,299
<font color="yellow">So in the end, he is the boy who will eventually hear the mermaid's voice again.</font>

20
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,950
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

21
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,850
<font color="yellow">He was...</font>

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,840
<font color="yellow">me.</font>

23
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,879
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me, have you seen someone who looks like this? <br> - No.</font>

24
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:18,000
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me, have you seen someone who looks like this?<br>- No.</font>

25
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,560
<font color="yellow">Today is the day where the Black Moon will appear.</font>

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,479
<font color="yellow">The Black Moon is the second new moon in a single calendar month.</font>

27
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,859
<font color="yellow">It's said that the moon disappears into the darkness,</font>

28
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:43,569
<font color="yellow">and that's how it got stuck with the name Black Moon.</font>

29
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,369
<font color="yellow">In the past, it was thought to be an ominous sign.</font>

30
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,859
<font color="yellow">Yang Seung Gil sent a message to the Hanyang official Jo Bong Hak, whom he's been sending bribes,</font>

31
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:10,889
<font color="yellow">claiming that the town head of Heupgok village is bewitched by the wicked mermaid and disturbing the public,</font>

32
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,089
<font color="yellow">and that you had framed him of murder.</font>

33
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:20,449
<font color="yellow">Thereafter, Jo Bong Hak has submitted a written petition to the King. What shall we do?</font>

34
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:27,439
<font color="yellow">In addition, Yang's underlings are casting all kinds of fishing nets every day,</font>

35
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,949
<font color="yellow">frantically trying to capture the mermaid.</font>

36
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,709
<font color="yellow">Open the door.</font>

37
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,280
<font color="yellow">My Lord, why are you like this?</font>

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,899
<font color="yellow">Die.</font>

39
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,339
<font color="yellow">And don't ever be born again.</font>

40
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,550
<font color="yellow">Why are my dreams like this?</font>

41
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,629
<font color="yellow">It's a real mermaid.</font>

42
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:26,229
<font color="yellow">Just watch and see. I will make that mermaid mine again, no matter what it takes.</font>

43
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,909
<font color="yellow">That naive town head...</font>

44
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,879
<font color="yellow">I will get rid of him with my own hand.</font>

45
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,479
<font color="yellow">Die and don't ever be born again.</font>

46
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,899
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae...</font>

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,459
<font color="yellow">and the mermaid.</font>

48
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,879
<font color="yellow">Legend of the Blue Sea</font>

49
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,909
<font color="yellow">Episode 11</font>

50
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,569
<font color="yellow">Refund all of this with money.</font>

51
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,990
<font color="yellow">All of this?</font>

52
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,949
<font color="yellow">Did Cheong not come yet?</font>

53
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,240
<font color="yellow">Tae Oh was looking at the CCTVs of the house and the neighborhood,</font>

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,509
<font color="yellow">and you know those bags from the Gangnam department store? I think she was carrying those out.</font>

55
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,729
<font color="yellow">- To do what with those?<br>- I don't know. Maybe she's selling them and getting a rental room.</font>

56
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,620
<font color="yellow">Why would she get a rental room, leaving her own house? Move!</font>

57
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,789
<font color="yellow">Is this Cheong's house? It's your house. You'd always say it's your house.</font>

58
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,060
<font color="yellow">Where did she go? Did you see the department store?</font>

59
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,199
<font color="yellow">- Do you think it's easy to get inside the department store?<br>- Do it quickly! Quickly!</font>

60
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,399
<font color="yellow">Are you really a hacker?</font>

61
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,180
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many people are in a department store? Do you think it's easy to find her? When will we?</font>

62
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,670
<font color="yellow">Find her location with your phone.</font>

63
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,589
<font color="yellow">It's turned off.</font>

64
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:58,620
<font color="yellow">Hey, I somehow have this bad feeling about this. Did she leave for good, by chance?</font>

65
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,599
<font color="yellow">Thank you for renewing the contract with favorable conditions.</font>

66
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,899
<font color="yellow">Of course I should. You've kept good relations with my father.</font>

67
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,680
<font color="yellow">I hardly ever see CEO Heo anymore.</font>

68
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,750
<font color="yellow">Oh, my father's condition is not that great.</font>

69
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,860
<font color="yellow">Well, since his son is so dependable like this, he is entrusting it to you.</font>

70
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,199
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

71
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,610
<font color="yellow">Wait... She shouldn't be riding that.</font>

72
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,319
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

73
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,949
<font color="yellow">It's time to close the shop, and there are no customers here,</font>

74
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,259
<font color="yellow">- so let's just leave her for a bit.<br>- Ah, yes.</font>

75
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,460
<font color="yellow">My secret is that I'm different from you.</font>

76
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,000
<font color="yellow">That I'm a mermaid.</font>

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,200
<font color="yellow">If you find out who I am, you're going to be surprised, hurt, and scared of me.</font>

78
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,140
<font color="yellow">You're going to leave me.</font>

79
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,570
<font color="yellow">So I'm trying my best to not get found out.</font>

80
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,730
<font color="yellow">Did I come into some kind of children's book?</font>

81
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,100
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

82
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,170
<font color="yellow">Did you come out to the world?</font>

83
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,710
<font color="yellow">You guys match each other so well,</font>

84
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,920
<font color="yellow">so when are you guys planning to marry?</font>

85
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,420
<font color="yellow">We will soon. Thinking about Dubai or Europe early next year.</font>

86
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,270
<font color="yellow">Oh my! I see!</font>

87
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,170
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm a person who lies.</font>

88
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,720
<font color="yellow">I cheat others and get money off of cheating them. That's right.</font>

89
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,230
<font color="yellow">I'm that kind of person. That is my secret.</font>

90
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,200
<font color="yellow">What's yours?</font>

91
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,570
<font color="yellow">Oh? Heo Joon Jae's family?</font>

92
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,629
<font color="yellow">Ah, just call me Heo Chi Hyeon.</font>

93
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,070
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo Chi Hyeon.</font>

94
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,200
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

95
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,020
<font color="yellow">But did you come by yourself? What about Joon Jae?</font>

96
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,950
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of pretty and good things here.</font>

97
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,120
<font color="yellow">There wasn't anything like this where I lived.</font>

98
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,730
<font color="yellow">Where is it? Wherever it is, there's bound to be a Christmas.</font>

99
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,759
<font color="yellow">There's a place where there's not.</font>

100
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,030
<font color="yellow">Where's your house?</font>

101
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,259
<font color="yellow">I live with Heo Joon Jae.</font>

102
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,570
<font color="yellow">You live together?</font>

103
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,590
<font color="yellow">I'm the upper room; he's the lower room.</font>

104
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,830
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae's the house owner.</font>

105
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,330
<font color="yellow">Ah, I see.</font>

106
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,620
<font color="yellow">You didn't bring a car, right?</font>

107
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,100
<font color="yellow">Should I give you a ride?</font>

108
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,750
<font color="yellow">Then instead of driving me home, will you drive me to that place?</font>

109
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,960
<font color="yellow">Ah, you're really going to sleep here?</font>

110
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. Looking at the TV, there were a lot of people who sleep here when they come out of the house.</font>

111
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,840
<font color="yellow">Well, okay, but be safe.</font>

112
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,230
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

113
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,360
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

114
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,150
<font color="yellow">Cheong Hae Spa Sauna<br>Men / Women</font>

115
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,310
<font color="yellow">- Oh, wait! <br>- Hey, you!</font>

116
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,780
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? <br>- Hey!</font>

117
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,120
<font color="yellow">This is the women's side. No!</font>

118
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

119
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,140
<font color="yellow">Here is the ladies' side.</font>

120
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,550
<font color="yellow">She went inside well, right?</font>

121
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,180
<font color="yellow">Will it take much longer?</font>

122
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,800
<font color="yellow">To protect the VVIP room, there's no CCTV.</font>

123
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,720
<font color="yellow">Ah, just do it quickly.</font>

124
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,840
<font color="yellow">I did think it was very nerve-wracking yesterday.</font>

125
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,560
<font color="yellow">You guys weren't talking and were just trying to out-stare each other.</font>

126
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,259
<font color="yellow">Wow, when Cheong was like that, I feel some type of unapproachable charisma.</font>

127
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,600
<font color="yellow">- Hyung.<br>- Yeah?</font>

128
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,670
<font color="yellow">Do you know the story of the Little Mermaid?</font>

129
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,590
<font color="yellow">Oh my. So suddenly. Really sudden.</font>

130
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,340
<font color="yellow">Well, isn't it like the mermaid princess goes up to the land and falls in love with the prince?</font>

131
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,100
<font color="yellow">Yeah, and the witch gave her legs,</font>

132
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,110
<font color="yellow">but after midnight, it turned back to a tail,</font>

133
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,690
<font color="yellow">and she couldn't wear her glass shoes, and the prince was searching for the owner of the shoes...</font>

134
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,320
<font color="yellow">Isn't that something else?</font>

135
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,900
<font color="yellow">Cinderella.</font>

136
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,270
<font color="yellow">You find this instead.</font>

137
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,660
<font color="yellow">Aren't children's stories the same thing?</font>

138
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,910
<font color="yellow">Like that, the prince and the mermaid falls in love and get married. The end.</font>

139
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,330
<font color="yellow">- Was it? <br>- That's Disney's version. She dies in the original version.</font>

140
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,360
<font color="yellow">- Dies? <br>- I think so.</font>

141
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,020
<font color="yellow">Who? The prince? The mermaid?</font>

142
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,910
<font color="yellow">That's right! I think the mermaid died.</font>

143
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,800
<font color="yellow">Why does the mermaid die?</font>

144
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,100
<font color="yellow">What kind of lame children's story is that?</font>

145
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,480
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I know. Kids read that so why would they do that?</font>

146
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,960
<font color="yellow">But why are we talking about that at dawn? These days, they say that even kids don't read the classic children's stories, either.</font>

147
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,250
<font color="yellow">Ah, I don't know.</font>

148
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,440
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and find her.</font>

149
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,570
<font color="yellow">- Oh, it's refreshing.<br>- Isn't it good?</font>

150
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,310
<font color="yellow">Miss!</font>

151
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,620
<font color="yellow">This is my spot!</font>

152
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,610
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

153
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,970
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

154
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,250
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

155
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,000
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. Did Cheong perhaps come here?</font>

156
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,420
<font color="yellow">What's the story that's read with great emotion?</font>

157
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,270
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

158
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,620
<font color="yellow">I think it's Romeo and Juliet.</font>

159
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,960
<font color="yellow">I cried. Shakespeare isn't a maestro for nothing.</font>

160
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,440
<font color="yellow">Did you see her? Cheong?</font>

161
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,970
<font color="yellow">Sit here for a bit.</font>

162
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,190
<font color="yellow">In this world,</font>

163
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,050
<font color="yellow">there are many love stories. But from all those love stories,</font>

164
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,430
<font color="yellow">if you take out the rhetoric and unessential words,</font>

165
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,430
<font color="yellow">there will be only one sentence left. What do you think it is?</font>

166
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,180
<font color="yellow">- What is it?<br>- "Be good to her when she's with you."</font>

167
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,060
<font color="yellow">Aish!</font>

168
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,120
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is that if you treated her well when she was with you, she wouldn't have left. You wouldn't be searching for her like this, either.</font>

169
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,810
<font color="yellow">It's the eternal truth.</font>

170
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,410
<font color="yellow">If you see Cheong, tell her to make sure to contact me.</font>

171
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,670
<font color="yellow">Make sure! For sure!</font>

172
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,960
<font color="yellow">See? He should listen to me. Otherwise, he will be regretting later.</font>

173
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,309
<font color="yellow">He's going to come back again. He's going to come again.</font>

174
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:03,759
<font color="yellow">I am here at this time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</font>

175
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,029
<font color="yellow">Come on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.</font>

176
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,519
<font color="yellow">It is not possible to track the location.</font>

177
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,500
<font color="yellow">Wow, daebak!</font>

178
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,450
<font color="yellow">Wow, daebak!</font>

179
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,440
<font color="yellow">Daebak!</font>

180
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,470
<font color="yellow">What does she do?</font>

181
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,360
<font color="yellow">Hey, I can see something else. Let's look for more things. Turn the cell phone on.</font>

182
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,750
<font color="yellow">- Hey, hurry up!<br>- Watch out for people.</font>

183
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,590
<font color="yellow">Hey! I found that girl first!</font>

184
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,819
<font color="yellow">- I'm the one who found the money.<br>- Hey, let's just divide equally.</font>

185
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,410
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

186
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,779
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Stop! You guys are playing hard.</font>

187
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,009
<font color="yellow">For now, give me the phone.</font>

188
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
<font color="yellow">Where did you find this?</font>

189
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,930
<font color="yellow">It's mine.</font>

190
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,730
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that so?</font>

191
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,019
<font color="yellow">It's my girlfriend's.</font>

192
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,740
<font color="yellow">Where's my girlfriend?</font>

193
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,450
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. <br>- You guys can keep all the money. Just tell me where she is.</font>

194
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,039
<font color="yellow">- The Cheonghae Sauna in front of here.<br>- Hey!<br>- What?</font>

195
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,400
<font color="yellow">Thanks! Friend, let's do a hand shake.</font>

196
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,970
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?<br>- Argh! Seriously!</font>

197
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,049
<font color="yellow">Me? I'm a scammer.</font>

198
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:31,740
<font color="yellow">If you guys are like this, you'll turn out like me.</font>

199
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,549
<font color="yellow">If the guy you like asks you what you do,</font>

200
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,900
<font color="yellow">then you'll have to lie about everything. Lies.</font>

201
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,779
<font color="yellow">Do you like that even then?</font>

202
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,420
<font color="yellow">- Ah, what is this? He took everything! <br>- Ah, seriously!</font>

203
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,539
<font color="yellow">My heart fluttered a bit just now. Bad-boy style.</font>

204
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,240
<font color="yellow">He was a bit cool.</font>

205
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,080
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

206
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,950
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't sleep well,</font>

207
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,620
<font color="yellow">and so I think that's why I don't feel like eating.</font>

208
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,620
<font color="yellow">I was worried about you.</font>

209
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,289
<font color="yellow">Since it was my day-off, I came here.</font>

210
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,100
<font color="yellow">It looks like your hunger came back. Please eat it with this rice shake.</font>

211
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,140
<font color="yellow">You're a good person.</font>

212
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,470
<font color="yellow">I don't have a name, but I was told I'm not a strange person.</font>

213
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,049
<font color="yellow">-Who?<br>-A good person.</font>

214
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,410
<font color="yellow">Do you know me? You don't have anything to say to me, right? Then don't follow me.</font>

215
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,670
<font color="yellow">Then are you not leaving? Take that and leave.</font>

216
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,870
<font color="yellow">â¬ When I enter, my eyes are dazzled â¬</font>

217
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,549
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae.</font>

218
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:37,789
<font color="yellow">â¬  A wide world welcomes me â¬</font>

219
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:47,069
<font color="yellow">â¬ I approach you. I want to be embraced. â¬</font>

220
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:53,910
<font color="yellow">â¬ I want to stay in that world which is you â¬</font>

221
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,430
<font color="yellow">â¬ I owe you I miss you  â¬</font>

222
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,470
<font color="yellow">You seriously. Who told you to leave the house and stay at a place like this?</font>

223
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,539
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I tried to find you?</font>

224
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:05,049
<font color="yellow">â¬ Eternally in your arms â¬</font>

225
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:06,950
<font color="yellow">How did you come here knowing this place?</font>

226
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,529
<font color="yellow">Heo Chi Hyeon drove me here.</font>

227
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

228
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:18,590
<font color="yellow">-Why are you here?<br>-Don't misunderstand.</font>

229
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,779
<font color="yellow">We coincidentally met each other outside yesterday, and Cheong said that she didn't want to go home.</font>

230
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,519
<font color="yellow">Not come?</font>

231
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,840
<font color="yellow">-You said that?<br>-Yeah.</font>

232
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,080
<font color="yellow">You go ahead.</font>

233
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,430
<font color="yellow">And you. Let's talk somewhere private.</font>

234
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,420
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae. I switched all of those items I bought last time into money.</font>

235
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,789
<font color="yellow">I don't need those clothes, so I'll return it to you.</font>

236
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,090
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I got it well.</font>

237
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,330
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

238
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,600
<font color="yellow">Take care of your phone too.</font>

239
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,960
<font color="yellow">How do you have that?</font>

240
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,720
<font color="yellow">I'm also a bad guy, but there's a lot more people who are worse than me here.</font>

241
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,480
<font color="yellow">So please be careful.</font>

242
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,170
<font color="yellow">What about food? Did you eat?</font>

243
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,289
<font color="yellow">I ate an egg and drank rice shake.</font>

244
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,759
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to eat anything more?</font>

245
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,880
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

246
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,319
<font color="yellow">Spicy rice cakes, blood sausages, laver rolls, strawberry-flavored shaved ice, melon-flavored shaved ice, fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, round-shaped dough seaweed soup.</font>

247
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,269
<font color="yellow">I see you don't have an appetite.</font>

248
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,490
<font color="yellow">I thought you would come, so I made grilled ribs at home.</font>

249
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,059
<font color="yellow">Ah, beef ribs is the best when seasoned.</font>

250
00:23:58,059 --> 00:23:59,650
<font color="yellow">It's seasoned beef ribs.</font>

251
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,360
<font color="yellow">It sounds delicious.</font>

252
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,559
<font color="yellow">It's really tasty.</font>

253
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,519
<font color="yellow">I thought it was melting in my mouth.</font>

254
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,850
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

255
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,850
<font color="yellow">I want to eat it, seasoned beef ribs.</font>

256
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,789
<font color="yellow">So, you're really not going to come?</font>

257
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,519
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

258
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,299
<font color="yellow">- Really?<br>- Yeah.</font>

259
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,910
<font color="yellow">- Why?<br>- Because you're a con artist.</font>

260
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:32,100
<font color="yellow">You're a bad bastard who tricks people. You tricked me too.</font>

261
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:40,279
<font color="yellow">But, why am I not disappointed? When you're a bad guy?</font>

262
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,590
<font color="yellow">Why can't I leave you, who fooled me?</font>

263
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,860
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to come home, stay here.</font>

264
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,980
<font color="yellow">Instead, don't go anywhere else. Stay here.</font>

265
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,180
<font color="yellow">You can't leave without saying goodbye.</font>

266
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,559
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

267
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,410
<font color="yellow">You promised.</font>

268
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,430
<font color="yellow">Then... I'm leaving.</font>

269
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,009
<font color="yellow">I said I'm leaving.</font>

270
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:18,940
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

271
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,779
<font color="yellow">What the heck? "Don't go, Heo Joon Jae."</font>

272
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:49,190
<font color="yellow">I thought she would say something like that. Why is she so cold-hearted?</font>

273
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:02,240
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae. Father is ill these days.</font>

274
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,140
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

275
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,600
<font color="yellow">Why? Where and how is he ill?</font>

276
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,850
<font color="yellow">The doctor said it was cataracts. His eyesight has impaired quite a lot.</font>

277
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,900
<font color="yellow">I told you to take care of him well.</font>

278
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,870
<font color="yellow">Escort him to the hospital well.</font>

279
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,710
<font color="yellow">I was grateful that he became my dad.</font>

280
00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:00,960
<font color="yellow">So I always want to be in his favor and protect him.</font>

281
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,529
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

282
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:10,680
<font color="yellow">Be grateful. Continue to be in his favor, and protect him.</font>

283
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,700
<font color="yellow">After my father became your's,</font>

284
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,600
<font color="yellow">there were many things that I failed to protect and lost.</font>

285
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,940
<font color="yellow">- Yes, thank you.<br>- Of course.</font>

286
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,019
<font color="yellow">Kang Ji Yeon?</font>

287
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:53,370
<font color="yellow">Did Ma Dae Yeong marry?</font>

288
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,830
<font color="yellow">Kang Ji Yeon. Who is that?</font>

289
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:14,190
<font color="yellow">Kang Ji Yeon, Kang Ji Yeon...</font>

290
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,410
<font color="yellow">She married twice.</font>

291
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,299
<font color="yellow">Both of her husbands died.</font>

292
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,600
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

293
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,920
<font color="yellow">But, the husband suddenly died.</font>

294
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,150
<font color="yellow">- A year after their marriage.<br>- Why?</font>

295
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:06,230
<font color="yellow">A little bit after their marriage, her husband's eyesight started to worsen.</font>

296
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,120
<font color="yellow">Honey. How do I look?</font>

297
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:28,319
<font color="yellow">I'll have to visit Doctor Kim again. The medicine...</font>

298
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,400
<font color="yellow">I called Doctor Kim.</font>

299
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,650
<font color="yellow">First, you should diligently take your medicine. He said resting at home after that would be the best.</font>

300
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,840
<font color="yellow">Just rest.</font>

301
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,610
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

302
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,440
<font color="yellow">You can't contact them?</font>

303
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,120
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

304
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,990
<font color="yellow">Goo Baek's dad has been ignoring my calls.</font>

305
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:11,450
<font color="yellow">And for CEO Kim's office, no matter how much I call, they won't connect me to him.</font>

306
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,000
<font color="yellow">That day, what did we do wrong?</font>

307
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,960
<font color="yellow">No, up to the meal was good. It was, right?</font>

308
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,539
<font color="yellow">It was. Did you see CEO Kim eat two plates of egg rolls?</font>

309
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,390
<font color="yellow">Exactly. After that,</font>

310
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,400
<font color="yellow">what was the problem?</font>

311
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,130
<font color="yellow">What did you say, Ahjumma?</font>

312
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,549
<font color="yellow">When I was walking by, it seemed to be that</font>

313
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,410
<font color="yellow">From the other's perspective, it could've beem burdensome.</font>

314
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,970
<font color="yellow">Ugh, I can't live because of you, Honey!</font>

315
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:01,500
<font color="yellow">I could see it.</font>

316
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,350
<font color="yellow">What kind of people are they? Would they not know?</font>

317
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,960
<font color="yellow">That's right. They were burdened.</font>

318
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:18,220
<font color="yellow">Aigoo, because of you, it's all ruined! What are you going to do?</font>

319
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,890
<font color="yellow">I can't live because of you!</font>

320
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,450
<font color="yellow">Ugh, what about Cheong? Did you find her?</font>

321
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,799
<font color="yellow">Why? She wouldn't come with you?</font>

322
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,269
<font color="yellow">The boiler in my room isn't working, so it's cold in there.</font>

323
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,549
<font color="yellow">I'm sleeping here tonight.</font>

324
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:50,740
<font color="yellow">No, if there is a problem,</font>

325
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,700
<font color="yellow">you should face each other in the same place</font>

326
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,549
<font color="yellow">and solve it through communication!</font>

327
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,779
<font color="yellow">Why, did Cheong say she didn't want to come home?</font>

328
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,470
<font color="yellow">Where did she learn about running away and other bad habits?</font>

329
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,140
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's something for you to say, when you ran away from home in high school.</font>

330
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,390
<font color="yellow">What? She doesn't want to come home?</font>

331
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,910
<font color="yellow">Who did Cheong say that to?</font>

332
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,360
<font color="yellow">There's some psycho like that.</font>

333
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,110
<font color="yellow">He's a psycho, that bastard.</font>

334
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,870
<font color="yellow">Did he treat you well?</font>

335
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,090
<font color="yellow">He gave me an umbrella when it was raining, and held my hand when I was alone.</font>

336
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,160
<font color="yellow">He made ramen for me too.</font>

337
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,330
<font color="yellow">Ra... Ramen?!</font>

338
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,590
<font color="yellow">Wow... ramen.</font>

339
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,750
<font color="yellow">He asked you to eat ramen with him? Wow, what a perverted bastard.</font>

340
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,500
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

341
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,269
<font color="yellow">That bastard...</font>

342
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,660
<font color="yellow">- was me?<br>- Huh?</font>

343
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,319
<font color="yellow">Don't hang out with people like that. You have to be careful of guys like that.</font>

344
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,900
<font color="yellow">I'm saying those guys are totally perverted!</font>

345
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,029
<font color="yellow">Agh!</font>

346
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,910
<font color="yellow">- Hey!<br>- That was me?</font>

347
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,700
<font color="yellow">You psycho!</font>

348
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,910
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

349
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,590
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

350
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,860
<font color="yellow">that bastard...</font>

351
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,480
<font color="yellow">was me.</font>

352
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,390
<font color="yellow">Not some other guy.</font>

353
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,980
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

354
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,360
<font color="yellow">No, that guy.</font>

355
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,660
<font color="yellow">It's me. Hyung.</font>

356
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,319
<font color="yellow">It was me.</font>

357
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,140
<font color="yellow">That guy was me.</font>

358
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'll sleep in my room even if it's frozen.</font>

359
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,240
<font color="yellow">- Hyung.<br>- You should rest. Or take medicine.</font>

360
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:09,589
<font color="yellow">â¬ It means it's you I'm waiting for â¬</font>

361
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,989
<font color="yellow">â¬ That's what's happening, idiot. My heart will keep beating â¬</font>

362
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:18,710
<font color="yellow">â¬ Why don't you know my heart  â¬</font>

363
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,609
<font color="yellow">â¬ That warm blowing breeze is â¬</font>

364
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,250
<font color="yellow">â¬ whispering to me it is today, â¬</font>

365
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,949
<font color="yellow">â¬ I'm going to give you my â¬</font>

366
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:39,119
<font color="yellow">â¬ pent-up confession of love. â¬</font>

367
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,250
<font color="yellow">That bastard...</font>

368
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,189
<font color="yellow">Aigoo!</font>

369
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:05,089
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I can't see that well.</font>

370
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,949
<font color="yellow">â¬  More than any word your eyes  â¬</font>

371
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:34,460
<font color="yellow">â¬ mean more, I can sense it â¬</font>

372
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,259
<font color="yellow">â¬ In last night's dream while you smiled â¬</font>

373
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:45,730
<font color="yellow">â¬ You were blowing like the wind â¬</font>

374
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,369
<font color="yellow">â¬ On the path I walked alone <br>In the dream I chased alone â¬</font>

375
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:53,629
<font color="yellow">â¬ You are at my side now â¬</font>

376
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,500
<font color="yellow">It's Heo Joon Jae.</font>

377
00:35:58,379 --> 00:36:02,639
<font color="yellow">â¬ Why will I remember it forever? â¬</font>

378
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,669
<font color="yellow">Don't open your eyes, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

379
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:08,750
<font color="yellow">Don't wake up, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

380
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,439
<font color="yellow">Just stay like this. So I can see you.</font>

381
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:14,889
<font color="yellow">So I can make up for the time I couldn't see you.</font>

382
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:18,480
<font color="yellow">I don't have to ask you anything.</font>

383
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,159
<font color="yellow">And you don't need to hide anything from me either.</font>

384
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,689
<font color="yellow">Don't open your eyes, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

385
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:28,199
<font color="yellow">â¬ From the moment you come to me â¬</font>

386
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:34,289
<font color="yellow">â¬ Come a step closer â¬</font>

387
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:36,169
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's cold.</font>

388
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:43,739
<font color="yellow">â¬ My heart is leaning toward you â¬</font>

389
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:46,299
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae will be cold too.</font>

390
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,659
<font color="yellow">Ah, why is it so hot?</font>
