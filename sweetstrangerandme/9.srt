- Goodbye.</font>

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen.</font>

109
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,860

115
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,590
<font color="yellow">Fine then. Bring him out with you.</font>

116
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,820
<font color="yellow">He didn't even say hello when he came in.</font>

117
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,190
<font color="yellow">I'm here, too. I'm leaving right away.</font>

118
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,620
<font color="yellow">The least he could do is say hello!</font>

119
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,790
<font color="yellow">I took my pills. I'm okay.</font>

120
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,420

121

<font color="yellow">My friend doesn't trust my driving,</font>

123
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,390
<font color="yellow">so she came to get the car herself.</font>

124
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,950
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see her?</font>

125
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

126
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,020
<font color="yellow">Look at me in the eyes.</font>

127
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,820
<font color="yellow">Do you really feel better?</font>

128
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

129
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
<font color="yellow">That man...</font>

130
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,360
<font color="yellow">He's the CEO of Da Da, right?</font>

131
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

132
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,790
<font color="yellow">- Your stepdad?
- My ex-stepdad.</font>

133
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,250
<font color="yellow">Did he bring all those guys on purpose?</font>

134
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,850
<font color="yellow">Is he threatening you?</font>

135
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,990
<font color="yellow">They always go around in groups.</font>

136
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,020
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

137
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,490
<font color="yellow">There's one reason I'm scared.</font>

138
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,250
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid you'll get hurt.</font>

139
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,890
<font color="yellow">Then you don't have to be scared.</font>

140
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,390
<font color="yellow">I won't get hurt.</font>

141
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,250
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, hurry up!</font>

142
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,450
<font color="yellow">- Who is that?
- I told you my friend is here.</font>

143
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,920
<font color="yellow">- I heard you ignored her.
- I didn't see her.</font>

<font color="yellow">You didn't say hi and strange men were bowing at you.</font>

146
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,120
<font color="yellow">It's going to be impossible to fix it.</font>

147
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,650
<font color="yellow">I can see our friendship cracking because of you.</font>

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,490
<font color="yellow">She's a good friend. I wouldn't like me, either.</font>

149
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,850
<font color="yellow">I feel bad saying this,</font>

150
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,590
<font color="yellow">but she has a husband, kids, and parents.</font>

151
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,820
<font color="yellow">I might be in 4th or 5th place for her.</font>

152
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,490
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

153
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,920
<font color="yellow">I'm in first place here. You only have me.</font>

154
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,550

00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,550
<font color="yellow">If you don't have a plan, end it.</font>

616
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,720
<font color="yellow">Are you meeting my brother here?</font>

617
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,220
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I broke my shoes and tore my jacket.</font>

618
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,650
<font color="yellow">I need to be reimbursed.</font>

619
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,250
<font color="yellow">Then eat dumplings and go.</font>

620
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,120
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

621
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,790
<font color="yellow">Where's Nan Gil?</font>

622
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,650
<font color="yellow">Who are you to ask...</font>

623
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,990
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Wan Shik.
- I told you.</font>

624
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,520
<font color="yellow">I'm not the same person.</font>

625
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,550
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of here.</font>

626
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,950
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Yes.</font>

627
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,920
<font color="yellow">It doesn't hurt, but I feel really cruddy.</font>

628
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,750
<font color="yellow">Not here. I will never...</font>

629
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,050
<font color="yellow">go back to where I was.</font>

630
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,190
<font color="yellow">So... So please!</font>

631
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,420
<font color="yellow">Help me. Please!</font>

632
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,650
<font color="yellow">Please help me.</font>

633
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,390
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

634
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,920
<font color="yellow">I'll keep your secret.</font>

635
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,790
<font color="yellow">Consider it a birthday gift.</font>

636
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,290
<font color="yellow">A birthday gift?</font>

637
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

638
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,720
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

639
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,390
<font color="yellow">I realized...</font>

640
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,320
<font color="yellow">physical pain is temporary,</font>

641
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,950
<font color="yellow">but psychological pain endures.</font>

642
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,820
<font color="yellow">Violence destroys your psyche.</font>

643
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,150
<font color="yellow">Do I need to quit this stupid restaurant?</font>

644
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,990
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

645
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,390
<font color="yellow">Not here. I will never...</font>

646
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,750
<font color="yellow">go back to where I was.</font>

647
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,250
<font color="yellow">So... So please!</font>

648
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,320
<font color="yellow">Help me.</font>

649
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,420
<font color="yellow">No, thank you. I need to drive.</font>

650
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,220
<font color="yellow">Your sister's there, too.</font>

651
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,520
<font color="yellow">I feel bad leaving by ourselves.</font>

652
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,990
<font color="yellow">That was nothing.</font>

653
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,050
<font color="yellow">My sister and I are used to it.</font>

654
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,590
<font color="yellow">My family is pathetic,</font>

655
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,420
<font color="yellow">and your family is surprisingly not very dignified.</font>

656
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,090
<font color="yellow">It's difficult to have both money and dignity.</font>

657
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,550
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be friends?</font>

658
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,050
<font color="yellow">I don't have any friends.</font>

659
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,050
<font color="yellow">You know everything about my family, so I feel...</font>

660
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,590
<font color="yellow">comfortable like there's nothing to hide.</font>

661
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,950
<font color="yellow">Na Ri is the only friend I need.</font>

662
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,850
<font color="yellow">Let's just meet today.</font>

663
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,720
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you for your shoes and clothes.</font>

664
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,150
<font color="yellow">Give up on Na Ri.</font>

665
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,850
<font color="yellow">She's in love.</font>

666
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,720
<font color="yellow">Enough to quit her job.</font>

667
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,820
<font color="yellow">But poor Na Ri.</font>

668
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,950
<font color="yellow">She's dating a dangerous man.</font>

669
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,490
<font color="yellow">Na Ri quit her job?</font>

670
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:11,450
<font color="yellow">She's taking a leave, but it's almost like she quit.</font>

671
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,950
<font color="yellow">When it comes to love, women jump in head first.</font>

672
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,120
<font color="yellow">How stupid.</font>

673
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,620
<font color="yellow">Poor guy. His face looks like...</font>

674
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,190
<font color="yellow">the world just ended.</font>

675
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,120
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

676
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,490
<font color="yellow">What does this place mean to him?</font>

677
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,050
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

678
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,890
<font color="yellow">I was talking to Mom.</font>

679
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:44,850
<font color="yellow">What about dinner?</font>

680
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,120
<font color="yellow">Noodle soup? Sujebi?</font>

681
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,690
<font color="yellow">Why are you staring? Do you have something to say?</font>

682
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,790
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

683
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,390
<font color="yellow">Just go and talk about Hong Na Ri's father.</font>

684
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,520
<font color="yellow">Her father Hong Sung Kyu...</font>

685
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,450
<font color="yellow">died, right?</font>

686
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,750
<font color="yellow">Just tell the truth.</font>

687
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,190
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

688
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,590
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo...</font>

689
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,290
<font color="yellow">What's with the bag?</font>

690
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,750
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

691
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,220
<font color="yellow">Don't act drunk. She had some wine.</font>

692
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,050
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you ended up having wine together,</font>

693
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,890
<font color="yellow">but why did you come here?</font>

694
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,950
<font color="yellow">Your little brother was here, too.</font>

695
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,790
<font color="yellow">- Your little...
- Stop saying, "little brother".</font>

696
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,750
<font color="yellow">I know you're trying to act drunk...</font>

697
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,750
<font color="yellow">so that you can sleep here.</font>

698
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

699
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,920
<font color="yellow">Your little brother is dangerous.</font>

700
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,920
<font color="yellow">Why did you quit because of a man like...</font>

701
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,420
<font color="yellow">Why is she the only one who's drunk?</font>

702
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,390
<font color="yellow">I had to drive.</font>

703
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,050
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

704
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,420
<font color="yellow">Na Ri quit?</font>

705
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,320
<font color="yellow">She's drunk. I have no idea what she's saying.</font>

706
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,620
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

707
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,850
<font color="yellow">Why would Na Ri quit?</font>

708
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,720
<font color="yellow">She's forever our leader.</font>

709
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,190
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

710
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,050
<font color="yellow">You need to thank me.</font>

711
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,190
<font color="yellow">Me? Thank you?</font>

712
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,990
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

713
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,050
<font color="yellow">You and Dong Jin were over long ago.</font>

714
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,220
<font color="yellow">Love didn't fade.</font>

715
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,490
<font color="yellow">There was no love to even fade.</font>

716
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,090
<font color="yellow">I ended it for you.</font>

717
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,750
<font color="yellow">You're in love.</font>

718
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,490
<font color="yellow">I let you meet your little brother.</font>

719
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,290
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing up the past?</font>

720
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,290
<font color="yellow">Go up and sleep.</font>

721
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,650
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ko.</font>

722
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,090
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do something,</font>

723
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,350
<font color="yellow">but I want to ask beforehand.</font>

724
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,650
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

725
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,150
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

726
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,490
<font color="yellow">You know that because you're married to Na Ri's mom,</font>

727
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:51,250
<font color="yellow">you and Na Ri can never be, right?</font>

728
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,320
<font color="yellow">I like Na Ri.</font>

729
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,790
<font color="yellow">I want to hear her stepdad's opinion.</font>

730
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,820
<font color="yellow">Then why are you seeing that colleague?</font>

731
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,650
<font color="yellow">If I don't see that colleague, will you support me?</font>

732
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,250
<font color="yellow">I would've been annoyed if you said,</font>

733
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,250
<font color="yellow">"My daughter cares only for her dad."</font>

734
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,950
<font color="yellow">But I guess you'll consider it for her sake.</font>

735
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:13,950
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

736
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,650
<font color="yellow">I considered whether we could be friends,</font>

737
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,950
<font color="yellow">but I don't think so.</font>

738
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,890
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be your friend, either.</font>

739
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,290
<font color="yellow">You did good, not telling him about my taking leave.</font>

740
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not that dense.</font>

741
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,420
<font color="yellow">What's that? Are those cosmetics all for one night?</font>

742
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,790
<font color="yellow">I'm doing the minimum tonight.</font>

743
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,450
<font color="yellow">You must put it on daily for your skin to be healthy.</font>

744
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,650
<font color="yellow">You can't be lazy.</font>

745
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,120
<font color="yellow">Sure. People don't change.</font>

746
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,120
<font color="yellow">Did Duk Bong leave?</font>

747
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,690
<font color="yellow">Did you think we'd be eating together?</font>

748
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,620
<font color="yellow">Your mood swings are worsening. You'll become like me.</font>

749
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,150
<font color="yellow">You'll get stressed and wrinkly.</font>

750
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:19,220
<font color="yellow">Noodle soup! Noodle soup. Noodle soup.</font>

751
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,320
<font color="yellow">Noodle soup that my dad made.</font>

752
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,550
<font color="yellow">You'll get dust in there.</font>

753
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,220
<font color="yellow">Wan Shik and I fought in front of the customers.</font>

754
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,590
<font color="yellow">I guess you really aren't friends.</font>

755
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,250
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong is right.</font>

756
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,190
<font color="yellow">That's the kind of person I used to be.</font>

757
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,650
<font color="yellow">You don't need to tell me everything.</font>

758
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,520
<font color="yellow">What does this house...</font>

759
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,150
<font color="yellow">and Hong Dumplings mean to you?</font>

760
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,390
<font color="yellow">Are they more important than me?</font>

761
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:04,650
<font color="yellow">Must I be jealous of a place filled with your memories?</font>

762
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,220
<font color="yellow">Everything here is...</font>

763
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,950
<font color="yellow">Hong Na Ri to me.</font>

764
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,250
<font color="yellow">Then look at the real Hong Na Ri before you.</font>

765

766
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,020
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

767
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,050
<font color="yellow">Uncle Jung Nam.</font>

768
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,190
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

769
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,920
<font color="yellow">You! Get out of this house right now!</font>
