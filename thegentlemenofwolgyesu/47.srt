00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,132
<font color="yellow">You and Hyo Sang caused this mess,</font>

94
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:36,132
<font color="yellow">so discuss this amongst yourselves and find a solution.</font>

99

<font color="yellow">We could actually end up on the streets?</font>

100

00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:38,832
<font color="yellow">Mother. Please forgive Hyo Won and allow her back in the house.</font>

155
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,402
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault. Hyo Won has nothing to blame.</font>

156
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,272
<font color="yellow">She walked out on her own and cut all ties with me.</font>

157
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,502
<font color="yellow">I have no intention of begging her to come back.</font>

158
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,502
<font color="yellow">I can act as if I never had a daughter.</font>

159
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,602
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Who are you calling Mother?</font>

160
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:52,532
<font color="yellow">Unless she breaks up with you,</font>

161
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,772
<font color="yellow">I won't accept Hyo Won as my daughter.</font>

162
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:03,902
<font color="yellow">Like mother, like daughter. They're both stubborn.</font>

163
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,102
<font color="yellow">How will I resolve this problem?</font>

164
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,272
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

165
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,802
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, are you there?</font>

166
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:40,132
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - May I come in?</font>

167
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,672
<font color="yellow">Are you going to sleep here?</font>

168
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,872
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why are you asking?</font>

169
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:52,402
<font color="yellow">We have our room. Why do you want to sleep here?</font>

170
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:55,802
<font color="yellow">Well, I've thought about that.</font>

171
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:58,102
<font color="yellow">We didn't go down the aisle.</font>

172
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,602
<font color="yellow">So I think it's not right that I sleep in that room.</font>

173
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,732
<font color="yellow">Parents would think the same.</font>

174
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,272
<font color="yellow">I don't agree with you.</font>

175
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:08,372
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's register our marriage...</font>

176
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,302
<font color="yellow">first thing in the morning.</font>

177
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,272
<font color="yellow">Register marriage?</font>

178
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:15,272
<font color="yellow">Once we register our marriage, you can stay in our room...</font>

179
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,932
<font color="yellow">and feel comfortable about it. Then I would feel comfortable, too.</font>

180
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,372
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

181
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,972
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's go and register our marriage tomorrow morning.</font>

182
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,332
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

183
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,502
<font color="yellow">By the way, Yun Shil,</font>

184
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,472
<font color="yellow">about Hong Gi Pyo.</font>

185
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,932
<font color="yellow">He woke up, so you don't have to worry about him.</font>

186
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,972
<font color="yellow">How do you know?</font>

187
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,272
<font color="yellow">I called the hospital a while ago.</font>

188
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:48,632
<font color="yellow">Actually, I received a call just now.</font>

189
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:51,402
<font color="yellow">- Did Hong Gi Pyo call you? - No,</font>

190
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:54,772
<font color="yellow">they asked me to come to the hospital...</font>

191
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:57,432
<font color="yellow">since he was upset due to a minor accident.</font>

192
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:59,772
<font color="yellow">However, I told them to contact his mother.</font>

193
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,372
<font color="yellow">That's good. You don't have to worry...</font>

194
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:06,632
<font color="yellow">now that he woke up and is recovering all right.</font>

195
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:12,272
<font color="yellow">Well, it's your last night as a single girl.</font>

196
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:15,732
<font color="yellow">You can snore and roll over as much as you want.</font>

197
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,972
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm very gentle when I sleep.</font>

198
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:23,072
<font color="yellow">I've seen you sleeping several times,</font>

199
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,872
<font color="yellow">and you were always snoring and rolling over.</font>

200
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:26,872
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

201
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:29,532
<font color="yellow">I always wake up in the morning right on the same position...</font>

202
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:31,202
<font color="yellow">as the one I sleep the night before.</font>

203
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:35,502
<font color="yellow">That's because you roll over here and there and come back.</font>

204
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,572
<font color="yellow">Stop making fun of me.</font>

205
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,432
<font color="yellow">I just want you to sleep comfortably.</font>

206
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:43,502
<font color="yellow">- Good night. - Have a nice dream.</font>

207
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,972
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

208
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,132
<font color="yellow">You punk. Where are you now?</font>

209
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:21,632
<font color="yellow">Have you told Yun Shil already?</font>

210
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:23,732
<font color="yellow">I guess you're scared.</font>

211
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,272
<font color="yellow">Are you mocking me right now?</font>

212
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,332
<font color="yellow">- I'll kill you. - Do you have nothing else to say?</font>

213
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:33,702
<font color="yellow">I guess that's the best you can do.</font>

214
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:35,872
<font color="yellow">I don't want to play words with you.</font>

215
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,802
<font color="yellow">You think you had a good one today,</font>

216
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,002
<font color="yellow">but nothing would change even if Yun Shil hears the truth.</font>

217
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,632
<font color="yellow">I would never give up on Yun Shil. She's mine.</font>

218
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:46,432
<font color="yellow">You are really...</font>

219
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:48,672
<font color="yellow">a natural born bully.</font>

220
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:50,002
<font color="yellow">Listen up.</font>

221
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:51,932
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be forgiven...</font>

222
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,632
<font color="yellow">for the lies you told Yun Shil 10 years ago.</font>

223
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,932
<font color="yellow">Also, what you've been doing to take control of Yun Shil...</font>

224
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,132
<font color="yellow">- are all criminal acts. - Are trying to teach me right now?</font>

225
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,402
<font color="yellow">No, I'm warning you.</font>

226
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,172
<font color="yellow">If you ever show your face again,</font>

227
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:08,602
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know how a criminal like you...</font>

228
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:10,672
<font color="yellow">should be punished.</font>

229
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:14,432
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to go back to prison after just several days,</font>

230
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,532
<font color="yellow">don't you dare come around Yun Shil again.</font>

231
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,232
<font color="yellow">Don't hang up on me.</font>

232
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:21,802
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

233
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,432
<font color="yellow">You've been deceived by a jerk like him for over 10 years.</font>

234
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:49,972
<font color="yellow">What a pity.</font>

235
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:00,932
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

236
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:05,872
<font color="yellow">They get on my nerves. What are they doing every night?</font>

237
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:10,102
<font color="yellow">- That's what I'm saying. - My goodness.</font>

238
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:13,102
<font color="yellow">They make me so mad. How irritating!</font>

239
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:15,902
<font color="yellow">Get your mind off of it. Go back to sleep.</font>

240
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,832
<font color="yellow">- Go to sleep. - I'm offended.</font>

241
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:20,332
<font color="yellow">That tickles.</font>

242
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,072
<font color="yellow">- Enough is enough. - I can't stand it.</font>

243
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:26,942
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for a moment, Dong Sook.</font>

244
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,402
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

245
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:32,802
<font color="yellow">It's late at night.</font>

246
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,502
<font color="yellow">You lack common sense. It's middle of the night,</font>

247
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:40,971
<font color="yellow">but you two giggle and whisper all night long.</font>

248
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,442
<font color="yellow">How can we go to sleep then?</font>

249
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,272
<font color="yellow">I understand you're newlyweds, but it's too much.</font>

250
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:49,632
<font color="yellow">Don't bother us and go to sleep.</font>

251
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:53,232
<font color="yellow">How can we not bother? We can hear you as we lie down.</font>

252
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,102
<font color="yellow">I fully understand that you're newlyweds,</font>

253
00:17:56,872 --> 00:18:00,442
<font color="yellow">but can't you keep quiet?</font>

254
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:02,332
<font color="yellow">You can have quality time and keep quiet at the same time.</font>

255
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:05,332
<font color="yellow">How can you keep quiet when you're having quality time?</font>

256
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,402
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense, Sun Nyeo.</font>

257
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,701
<font color="yellow">She's right. You can't keep quite when you have quality time.</font>

258
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,332
<font color="yellow">If you feel offended, you two can have quality time...</font>

259
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,872
<font color="yellow">as much as you want.</font>

260
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:15,532
<font color="yellow">We'd like that, too.</font>

261
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:18,372
<font color="yellow">- What's the problem then? - The problem is...</font>

262
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:20,002
<font color="yellow">we don't have enough time,</font>

263
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:24,732
<font color="yellow">we're aged and we have other reasons.</font>

264
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,802
<font color="yellow">- What reasons do we have? - Well...</font>

265
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:30,302
<font color="yellow">I mean, I have so much work to do at the tailor shop.</font>

266
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,402
<font color="yellow">So I'm tired and I need some rest.</font>

267
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,002
<font color="yellow">I know what you mean.</font>

268
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:37,172
<font color="yellow">I understand,</font>

269
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:40,502
<font color="yellow">but you shouldn't scold the newlyweds.</font>

270
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:43,802
<font color="yellow">You two should solve the problem together.</font>

271
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:45,572
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

272
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,572
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy.</font>

273
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:52,372
<font color="yellow">I want to pillow my head on your arm.</font>

274
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:54,232
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside, Dong Sook.</font>

275
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:58,502
<font color="yellow">- Sweet dreams, Sam Do. - Sweet dreams, Sun Nyeo.</font>

276
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,232
<font color="yellow">My pride has been hurt. I should take some medicine.</font>

277
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:07,971
<font color="yellow">They look happy. I envy Dong Sook.</font>

278
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,201
<font color="yellow">Do you envy her? Why do say that in front of me?</font>

279
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,832
<font color="yellow">You're too sensitive. I was just talking to myself.</font>

280
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,802
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow morning, go to the market...</font>

281
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:22,272
<font color="yellow">and buy some good quality eels.</font>

282
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:26,701
<font color="yellow">What's the racket? You didn't like to eat it when I cooked it for you.</font>

283
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,002
<font color="yellow">Now you ask me to buy it.</font>

284
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:32,701
<font color="yellow">I just feel like eating eels. I don't have any other reason.</font>

285
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:34,971
<font color="yellow">I don't trust what he says.</font>

286
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:38,201
<font color="yellow">Make sure you buy some good quality eels tomorrow.</font>

287
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:44,442
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

288
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,201
<font color="yellow">He wants me to buy eels for him.</font>

292
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:26,772
<font color="yellow">See? It's Yun Shil's true self.</font>

293
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,572
<font color="yellow">She's heartless.</font>

294
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,942
<font color="yellow">She receives a call from hospital that someone is almost dying...</font>

295
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:34,102
<font color="yellow">and she answers that she can't come as she's not the guardian.</font>

00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,602
<font color="yellow">Mum, please.</font>

304
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:02,701
<font color="yellow">All right, all right. I'm leaving.</font>

305
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,971
<font color="yellow">It's no use to have a child.</font>

306
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,471
<font color="yellow">I'm so unfortunate.</font>

307
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:13,602
<font color="yellow">I'll take some rest at the lounge.</font>

308
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,372
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil must have known the truth by now.</font>

309
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,772
<font color="yellow">What shall I do?</font>

310
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,072
<font color="yellow">- Mum, Dad, may we come inside? - Sure.</font>

311
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:43,802
<font color="yellow">- Good morning. - Good morning.</font>

312
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:49,201
<font color="yellow">We will register our marriage today.</font>

313
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,872
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you register your marriage?</font>

314
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:54,201
<font color="yellow">You mean you will register marriage when you didn't have the wedding?</font>

315
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:58,272
<font color="yellow">We're as good as we're married.</font>

316
00:21:58,302 --> 00:21:59,971
<font color="yellow">The formality of a wedding isn't important.</font>

317
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,102
<font color="yellow">If we really want to have a wedding,</font>

318
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:05,002
<font color="yellow">we can do that later with just friends and family.</font>

319
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:07,402
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

320
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:09,732
<font color="yellow">If you think that way, we should do so.</font>

321
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:12,732
<font color="yellow">You're saying okay without even thinking about it?</font>

322
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,102
<font color="yellow">But that's what they want.</font>

323
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:20,832
<font color="yellow">Why can't anything ever happen easily with you guys?</font>

324
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,471
<font color="yellow">I'm always nervous about you, like birds on a power line.</font>

325
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:27,672
<font color="yellow">This is all my fault. I'm sorry.</font>

326
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,701
<font color="yellow">The heart is what matters.</font>

327
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:32,002
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal about a wedding?</font>

328
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:35,201
<font color="yellow">Don't be upset, and let's give them our permission.</font>

329
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,471
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I won't let them.</font>

330
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:41,302
<font color="yellow">I'm just upset, that's all.</font>

331
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:42,602
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mother.</font>

332
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,932
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

333
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,232
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

334
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,872
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

335
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,971
<font color="yellow">Hey. We're living together.</font>

336
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:05,932
<font color="yellow">Can't you at least have...</font>

337
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:08,002
<font color="yellow">a little etiquette towards us?</font>

338
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,532
<font color="yellow">Come on. We're newlyweds.</font>

339
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:15,372
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were lovey-dovey when you first got married, too.</font>

340
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:17,532
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

341
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,602
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

342
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,701
<font color="yellow">My family caught me staying out all night with Sam Do,</font>

343
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,232
<font color="yellow">so my mum and cousins practically beat him up,</font>

344
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,002
<font color="yellow">and that's why we got married.</font>

345
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:29,802
<font color="yellow">But you know,</font>

346
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:34,872
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung said he thinks Sam Do is going through menopause.</font>

347
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,402
<font color="yellow">Men go through menopause, too?</font>

348
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:38,802
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

349
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:43,272
<font color="yellow">Doesn't he seem weak and unmotivated lately?</font>

350
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:45,332
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

351
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:48,201
<font color="yellow">You should be more attentive to him...</font>

352
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,602
<font color="yellow">and try to get him to want to do things.</font>

353
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:53,802
<font color="yellow">And don't wear sweats to sleep.</font>

354
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:55,402
<font color="yellow">Wear something nice.</font>

355
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,872
<font color="yellow">Where did you get that?</font>

356
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:02,302
<font color="yellow">At a department store.</font>

357
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:04,302
<font color="yellow">Is it expensive?</font>

358
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:06,302
<font color="yellow">I spent a bit.</font>

359
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:09,072
<font color="yellow">I went all out for the wedding.</font>

360
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:11,872
<font color="yellow">Let me borrow it just once.</font>

361
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:14,272
<font color="yellow">I'll wash it and give it back.</font>

362
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,572
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

363
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:18,832
<font color="yellow">You can't borrow someone's nightgown.</font>

364
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:21,532
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

365
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,902
<font color="yellow">It's sweet and sour. It tastes so good.</font>

366
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:31,502
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung will love this.</font>

367
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,332
<font color="yellow">I'll give you some.</font>

368
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:39,532
<font color="yellow">You want to swap cucumber salad with my nightgown?</font>

369
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,132
<font color="yellow">I'll wear it just once.</font>

370
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:46,832
<font color="yellow">Deal.</font>

371
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:53,632
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

372
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:13,302
<font color="yellow">What the... What's wrong with you?</font>

373
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:18,902
<font color="yellow">You look so much better lately.</font>

374
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,802
<font color="yellow">Really? I guess.</font>

375
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:27,572
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung, I envy you more than anyone right now.</font>

376
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:33,201
<font color="yellow">You've been lethargic and irritable lately.</font>

377
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:34,872
<font color="yellow">Your muscles are shrinking, too.</font>

378
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,201
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

379
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:41,632
<font color="yellow">I know. I just feel depressed lately.</font>

380
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:45,302
<font color="yellow">I get angry at the little things.</font>

381
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:48,132
<font color="yellow">And I keep crying.</font>

382
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:51,302
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

383
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:53,272
<font color="yellow">What brings you here so early?</font>

384
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:54,272
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

385
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:57,402
<font color="yellow">We're going to register our marriage,</font>

386
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:00,002
<font color="yellow">and we need witnesses, so we wanted you to sign it.</font>

387
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:04,232
<font color="yellow">You're finally going to be a legally wedded couple.</font>

388
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:06,332
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

389
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,471
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

390
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,572
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Yes?</font>

391
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:12,802
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin and Yun Shil are registering their marriage.</font>

392
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,932
<font color="yellow">They are? Congratulations.</font>

393
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:17,772
<font color="yellow">When they go register their marriage,</font>

394
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,701
<font color="yellow">let's go with them and register ours, too.</font>

395
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:23,072
<font color="yellow">What? You haven't registered your marriage yet?</font>

396
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,632
<font color="yellow">He just made his comeback.</font>

397
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:30,072
<font color="yellow">If word gets out that he's married, it'll hinder his popularity.</font>

398
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,532
<font color="yellow">We won't do it for the time being.</font>

399
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:35,672
<font color="yellow">What if Tae Pyung leaves you later?</font>

400
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:37,602
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

401
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:40,372
<font color="yellow">He'd never do that.</font>

402
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:43,072
<font color="yellow">Still, it would be better to follow the procedure...</font>

403
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,872
<font color="yellow">- according to the law. - Right?</font>

404
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:48,402
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Once he wins the best artist of the year,</font>

405
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:50,802
<font color="yellow">we can register our marriage then.</font>

406
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:54,302
<font color="yellow">True, he may not have much, but he wouldn't change.</font>

407
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:56,471
<font color="yellow">Should I sign here, where it says, "witness"?</font>

408
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:57,672
<font color="yellow">Yes. Here.</font>

409
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,602
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - There.</font>

410
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:01,602
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, you, too.</font>

411
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:03,672
<font color="yellow">Okay. Gosh.</font>

412
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,832
<font color="yellow">- "Witness one, Witness two." - Okay.</font>

413
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:07,272
<font color="yellow">Sign anywhere?</font>

414
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,532
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Okay.</font>

415
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:17,772
<font color="yellow">We're finally a married couple now.</font>

416
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,532
<font color="yellow">You're right. It still doesn't seem real.</font>

417
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:24,072
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem real, but we still need to commemorate,</font>

418
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:25,701
<font color="yellow">so let's take a picture.</font>

419
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:27,372
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

420
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,701
<font color="yellow">Here we go. One, two.</font>

421
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:40,372
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

422
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:41,672
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

423
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:44,872
<font color="yellow">Where's Yun Shil?</font>

424
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,632
<font color="yellow">Are you back again?</font>

425
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:49,872
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee and Yun Shil went to register their marriage.</font>

426
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:51,971
<font color="yellow">What? Do what?</font>

427
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:54,132
<font color="yellow">Register their marriage.</font>

428
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:57,332
<font color="yellow">They're legally married now,</font>

429
00:27:57,332 --> 00:28:00,372
<font color="yellow">so don't bug her again and don't come here again, either.</font>

430
00:28:00,902 --> 00:28:02,902
<font color="yellow">That evil brat.</font>

431
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:06,002
<font color="yellow">How dare she discard Gi Pyo like an old shoe?</font>

432
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,002
<font color="yellow">Wait. I don't have time for this.</font>

433
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,232
<font color="yellow">Good day.</font>

434
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:15,302
<font color="yellow">Seriously. I wish I could stop seeing that woman.</font>

435
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,532
<font color="yellow">My sentiments exactly.</font>

436
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,532
<font color="yellow">I don't know if she'll back off so easily, though.</font>

437
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:26,372
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo. Gi Pyo. This is bad.</font>

438
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,632
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

439
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:31,471
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, that brat, registered her marriage...</font>

440
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,432
<font color="yellow">with that tailor shop owner.</font>

441
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:34,432
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

442
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,832
<font color="yellow">Are... Are you okay?</font>

443
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:41,971
<font color="yellow">Who said Yun Shil registered her marriage?</font>

444
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:46,572
<font color="yellow">The tailor shop worker just told me.</font>

445
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:49,002
<font color="yellow">When I said to register her marriage with you,</font>

446
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:51,201
<font color="yellow">she made all sorts of excuses not to.</font>

447
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:54,372
<font color="yellow">That wicked wench.</font>

448
00:28:54,372 --> 00:28:57,572
<font color="yellow">This isn't right! This isn't right!</font>

449
00:28:57,572 --> 00:28:58,732
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo!</font>

450
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:01,971
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo! Gi Pyo! Goodness.</font>

451
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:06,272
<font color="yellow">You and Yun Shil just weren't meant to be.</font>

452
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:08,732
<font color="yellow">Let's hurt for now and forget it.</font>

453
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:13,701
<font color="yellow">Please, Gi Pyo. Please cut her out of your life...</font>

454
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:16,602
<font color="yellow">and let's finally live in peace.</font>

455
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:19,002
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you. Please.</font>

480
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:27,532
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't.</font>

481
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:30,072
<font color="yellow">No. I just saved up my allowance that my wife had given me.</font>

<font color="yellow">Then will we go bankrupt? What?</font>

498
00:31:30,832 --> 00:31:33,272
<font color="yellow">The great Meesa Apparel, going bankrupt just because...</font>

499

<font color="yellow">If the company goes under,</font>

504
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:46,932

894

<font color="yellow">You're weird.</font>

895
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:14,001
<font color="yellow">You used to shudder when I so much as mentioned eel.</font>

896
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:16,731
<font color="yellow">What made you want some tonight?</font>

897
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:21,201
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat this. It's more of a medicine.</font>

898

<font color="yellow">Time really changes people.</font>

899

900
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:34,071
<font color="yellow">How could you? I didn't get to eat one piece.</font>

901
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:36,601
<font color="yellow">I said it's not enjoyable.</font>

902
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:39,301
<font color="yellow">It's more like a medicine at this point.</font>

903
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:44,171
<font color="yellow">- At least there's no leftovers. - I feel so refreshed.</font>

904
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:47,871
<font color="yellow">What did you have?</font>

905
00:57:49,071 --> 00:57:51,631
<font color="yellow">You're eating eel this late at night?</font>

906
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,501
<font color="yellow">How dare you.</font>

907
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:00,531
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault.</font>

908
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:02,931
<font color="yellow">What is? I just stole one piece.</font>

909
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:05,471
<font color="yellow">You make me look bad by getting busy every night.</font>

910
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:07,171
<font color="yellow">I'm losing face here.</font>

911
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:12,731
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too old to get jealous about things like that?</font>

912
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:16,571
<font color="yellow">You brace yourselves for what's coming tonight.</font>

913
00:58:16,771 --> 00:58:18,471
<font color="yellow">You won't be getting any sleep.</font>

914
