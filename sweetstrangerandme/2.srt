5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,340
<font color="yellow">Who are you really?</font>

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,140
<font color="yellow">Your father.</font>

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,700
<font color="yellow">See? I was right. My father did send you.</font>

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,870
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying your father Hong Sung Kyu, but me.</font>

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,900
<font color="yellow">- What? - I am...</font>

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,200
<font color="yellow">Hong Na Ri's stepfather.</font>

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,670
<font color="yellow">So I won't watch you lose your sight,</font>

<font color="yellow">become malnourished or lack sleep from stress.</font>

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,370
<font color="yellow">So I will keep caring.</font>

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,370
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know once the results are out.</font>

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,040
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about? I'm speechless.</font>

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,140
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you little by little.</font>

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,470
<font color="yellow">How old are you, kid?</font>

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,770
<font color="yellow">I just told you I'm your stepdad.</font>

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,470
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a bit disrespectful?</font>

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,140
<font color="yellow">You should've done your research. My mom passed away.</font>

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,770
<font color="yellow">How could I have a stepdad when I don't have a mom?</font>

22
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,400
<font color="yellow">- Who are you? - I told you. Your dad.</font>

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,300
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be calling me as kid. Don't you think?</font>

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,800
<font color="yellow">Jung Im and I registered our marriage last year.</font>

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,540
<font color="yellow">What? Jung Im?</font>

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,400
<font color="yellow">Hey! You con artist gigolo!</font>

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,370
<font color="yellow">Calling me those names...</font>

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,770
<font color="yellow">is an insult to your mother.</font>

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,940
<font color="yellow">The day I met you by the tree...</font>

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,970
<font color="yellow">was our one-year anniversary.</font>

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,970
<font color="yellow">You could've registered the marriage by yourself.</font>

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,370
<font color="yellow">I'm sure my innocent mom didn't know anything.</font>

33
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,900
<font color="yellow">Of course, she did. She went with me.</font>

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,940
<font color="yellow">Are you saying my mom went with a kid like you,</font>

35
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,370
<font color="yellow">- I mean, with you to the... - Borough hall.</font>

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,800
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

37
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,370
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Why didn't you say anything by the tree then?</font>

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,470
<font color="yellow">Look how you're reacting even now.</font>

39
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,570
<font color="yellow">I couldn't just say I was your dad back then.</font>

40
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,770
<font color="yellow">I said I'd see you again.</font>

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,500
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me last night then?</font>

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,410
<font color="yellow">You were drunk and out of your mind.</font>

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,640
<font color="yellow">- How could I say I'm your dad? - Stop saying that.</font>

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,540
<font color="yellow">You're a stress ball. You have rage within you.</font>

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,170
<font color="yellow">You can't control your emotions.</font>

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,000
<font color="yellow">You get stressed out and can't sleep.</font>

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,700
<font color="yellow">Then you get wrinkles and age.</font>

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,800
<font color="yellow">Look here. I don't have many...</font>

49
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,640
<font color="yellow">winkles I think.</font>

50
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,800
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me?</font>

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,410
<font color="yellow">- You're stressed out and can't sleep... - A photo.</font>

52
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,470
<font color="yellow">You must have a photo as proof.</font>

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,640
<font color="yellow">Stepdad, you should show me proof.</font>

54
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,370
<font color="yellow">Like a photograph.</font>

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,670
<font color="yellow">There's nothing out of the ordinary.</font>

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
<font color="yellow">I think it was temporary loss of sight due to stress.</font>

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,500
<font color="yellow">You get stressed very easily.</font>

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,740
<font color="yellow">When there is nothing noticeably wrong,</font>

59
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,270
<font color="yellow">many question the diagnosis, but...</font>

60
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,100
<font color="yellow">- Are you married? - Yes, I am.</font>

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,570
<font color="yellow">How did you register your marriage?</font>

62
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,370
<font color="yellow">Did you go to a borough hall?</font>

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,840
<font color="yellow">Do both people go?</font>

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
<font color="yellow">Don't you need witnesses?</font>

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,100
<font color="yellow">A person really needs to help others.</font>

66
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,740
<font color="yellow">I helped a neighbor, and blessings came my way.</font>

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,070
<font color="yellow">Let's enter into a contract.</font>

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,370
<font color="yellow">What's the contract for?</font>

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,040
<font color="yellow">Sell your land for half the price we had offered.</font>

70
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,570
<font color="yellow">I'll buy it right now.</font>

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,840
<font color="yellow">Here. Sign it.</font>

72
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,670
<font color="yellow">You should've sold it sooner.</font>

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,370
<font color="yellow">If Hong Na Ri goes to court, you can't rest assured.</font>

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
<font color="yellow">So be satisfied with this price...</font>

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,670
<font color="yellow">- and sell. - Goes to court for what?</font>

76
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,070
<font color="yellow">To cancel the marriage and reclaim her inheritance...</font>

77
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,940
<font color="yellow">Fraud... Shall I go on?</font>

78
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,570
<font color="yellow">You want to sign with someone you think is a fraud?</font>

79
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,770
<font color="yellow">It's not like you scammed me.</font>

80
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,470
<font color="yellow">But legally, that land belongs to you.</font>

81
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,640
<font color="yellow">Even if you give me 10 times your first offer,</font>

82
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,240
<font color="yellow">I won't sell.</font>

83
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,170
<font color="yellow">You must be obsessed with money.</font>

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,470
<font color="yellow">Snap out of it. We'll get it eventually.</font>

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,140
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you conned an old lady 30 years older.</font>

86
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,400
<font color="yellow">- Watch your mouth! - Watch your mouth!</font>

87
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,840
<font color="yellow">That was disrespectful toward my late mom.</font>

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
<font color="yellow">Apologize right this instant.</font>

89
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were listening.</font>

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,370
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Is it my fault for hearing?</font>

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,070
<font color="yellow">What kind of insincere and fake apology is that?</font>

92
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Sorry.</font>

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,840
<font color="yellow">What were the test results?</font>

94
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,640
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong.</font>

95
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,670
<font color="yellow">Isn't that great?</font>

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,400
<font color="yellow">Why is she angry at me instead of the con artist?</font>

97
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,870
<font color="yellow">Let her lose the house, land and everything.</font>

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,670
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Hong Na Ri. - Yes.</font>

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,440
<font color="yellow">Father? You should make your cons more believable.</font>

100
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,970
<font color="yellow">Don't live like that.</font>

101
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,000
<font color="yellow">You insulted my mom and me, you con artist!</font>

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,900
<font color="yellow">I won't let you take my house. I'll protect it!</font>

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,270
<font color="yellow">You don't belong in my house, but behind bars.</font>

104
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,970
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the police. Let's go to the police!</font>

105
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,540
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,900
<font color="yellow">My mom said she had something to tell me.</font>

107
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,800
<font color="yellow">Was that something about her getting married?</font>

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,640
<font color="yellow">Do you really expect me to believe you?</font>

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,240
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to treat you like my stepdad?</font>

110
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,170
<font color="yellow">No! I know my mom.</font>

111
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,340
<font color="yellow">I'd never lose the house. We're strangers!</font>

112
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,640
<font color="yellow">Get out of my house!</font>

113

119
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,340
<font color="yellow">You should've called us.</font>

120
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,700
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Dong Jin to give you a call.</font>

121

129
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,340

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,270
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Where are you going?</font>

155
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,400
<font color="yellow">- Hi. - Hello.</font>

156
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,470
<font color="yellow">Let's eat!</font>

157
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,870
<font color="yellow">- Welcome. - Hello.</font>

158
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,440
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

159
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,500
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Come in.</font>

160
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,900
<font color="yellow">I'll put you in a quiet room with great scenery.</font>

161
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,700
<font color="yellow">Scenery helps end a lovers' quarrel.</font>

162
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,370
<font color="yellow">- No, we're father and... - Yes.</font>

163
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the quiet room.</font>

164
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,040
<font color="yellow">Okay. Come in.</font>

165
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,170
<font color="yellow">Whether people think we're a couple or siblings,</font>

166
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,540
<font color="yellow">don't correct them.</font>

167
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,270
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say we're father and daughter again.</font>

168
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,770
<font color="yellow">That's the source of stress.</font>

169
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,740
<font color="yellow">You're worried about what others will think.</font>

170
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,170
<font color="yellow">Why do you care what they think?</font>

171
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,740
<font color="yellow">We're not a couple. We're not friends.</font>

172
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,940
<font color="yellow">We're not siblings, either.</font>

173
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,800
<font color="yellow">Lying because of other people...</font>

174
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

175
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,870
<font color="yellow">You have a lot of rage. You must be stressed out.</font>

176
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,140
<font color="yellow">How could you be so stressed that you can't see?</font>

177
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,970
<font color="yellow">You're avoiding the question. Are you younger than me?</font>

178
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,600
<font color="yellow">We don't need to discuss our age in our relationship.</font>

179
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,800
<font color="yellow">Let's speak formally since the situations are unclear.</font>

180
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,240
<font color="yellow">Please eat, take your medicine,</font>

181
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,270
<font color="yellow">get stronger and go to Seoul.</font>

182
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,340
<font color="yellow">Please go to a big hospital once you're there.</font>

183
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,370
<font color="yellow">Eat well and sleep well.</font>

184
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,600
<font color="yellow">Don't be stressed. Okay?</font>

185
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,900
<font color="yellow">You want me to disappear from your sight because...</font>

186
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,870
<font color="yellow">you feel guilty. Is that it? Not a chance.</font>

187
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,700
<font color="yellow">I'll eat, take my medicine and get stronger.</font>

188
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,640
<font color="yellow">And then we should talk.</font>

189
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,000
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly. Chew it well.</font>

190
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,270
<font color="yellow">If you keep acting like a dad, I'll get angry.</font>

191
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,700
<font color="yellow">I can't say my daughter is my daughter.</font>

192
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,170
<font color="yellow">She won't say her father is her father.</font>

193
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,070
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm joking?</font>

194
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,440
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about how I'd feel?</font>

195
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,800
<font color="yellow">What feelings?</font>

196
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,040
<font color="yellow">Is it that you're upset about your mom's getting...</font>

197
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,240
<font color="yellow">married without telling you?</font>

198
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,940
<font color="yellow">- Did you have a ceremony? - Or...</font>

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,400
<font color="yellow">is it that you're flustered because a stranger is...</font>

200
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,600
<font color="yellow">living in the house you thought you'd inherit?</font>

201
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,500
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

202
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,170
<font color="yellow">You look pretty.</font>

203
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,770
<font color="yellow">I must look pretty because it's been a while.</font>

204
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,040
<font color="yellow">- Were you surprised that I wanted to meet? - No.</font>

205
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,840
<font color="yellow">I should've called first.</font>

206
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,740
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Don't say things like that.</font>

207
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,300
<font color="yellow">I asked to meet during lunch to keep it brief.</font>

208
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,070
<font color="yellow">I don't think we ended it properly.</font>

209
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,140
<font color="yellow">And I wondered what the status was...</font>

210
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,970
<font color="yellow">with Na Ri.</font>

211
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,640
<font color="yellow">That's right. Na Ri was in the ER.</font>

212
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,900
<font color="yellow">I need to go.</font>

213
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,000
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

214
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,700
<font color="yellow">Is she sick?</font>

215
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,840
<font color="yellow">No. You should go.</font>

216
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,300
<font color="yellow">- Go. - Okay.</font>

217
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,800
<font color="yellow">Wait here. I'll drop you off on the way.</font>

218
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,500
<font color="yellow">- No, it's okay. - It's okay.</font>

219
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,570
<font color="yellow">Darn it. She's playing dirty.</font>

220
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,940
<font color="yellow">How is it not shocking?</font>

221
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,200
<font color="yellow">I can understand that my mom married a young man...</font>

222
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,600
<font color="yellow">and she gave him everything she had.</font>

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,670
<font color="yellow">If she were alive, I could understand it all,</font>

224
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,000
<font color="yellow">but it's too strange.</font>

225
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,270
<font color="yellow">I can't accept it.</font>

226
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,100
<font color="yellow">If she were alive...</font>

227
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,840
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

228
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,470
<font color="yellow">I say that several times a day.</font>

229
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,540
<font color="yellow">Every single day.</font>

230
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,700
<font color="yellow">I know too well that there are cars...</font>

231
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,400
<font color="yellow">that drive recklessly.</font>

232
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,740
<font color="yellow">Why did she have to be there?</font>

233
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,000
<font color="yellow">My mom said she wanted to tell me something in person.</font>

234
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,970
<font color="yellow">I kept making excuses that I was busy...</font>

235
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,900
<font color="yellow">and didn't go home.</font>

236
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,800
<font color="yellow">Was this what my mom...</font>

237
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,840
<font color="yellow">wanted to tell me?</font>

238
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,700
<font color="yellow">Probably.</font>

239
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,500
<font color="yellow">Answer honestly to my questions.</font>

240
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,070
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

241
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,070
<font color="yellow">If I must lie, I won't answer.</font>

242
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,440
<font color="yellow">Did my mom talk about me?</font>

243
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,370
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

244
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,740
<font color="yellow">How long have you worked at our dumpling place?</font>

245
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,200
<font color="yellow">- It was before we registered our marriage... - So?</font>

246
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,400
<font color="yellow">You happened to go to a dumpling place in the boonies,</font>

247
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,070
<font color="yellow">happened to work there...</font>

248
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,400
<font color="yellow">and happened to meet my mom and marry her.</font>

249
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,670
<font color="yellow">- Is that it? - No.</font>

250
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,470
<font color="yellow">I was predestined to meet her.</font>

251
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,900
<font color="yellow">Then why did I never see you?</font>

252
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,400
<font color="yellow">You came at night or when the restaurant was closed.</font>

253
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,470
<font color="yellow">And when you came, all you did was sleep in your room.</font>

254
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,570
<font color="yellow">- I avoided you sometimes. - Why did you avoid me?</font>

255
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,870
<font color="yellow">Do you still go to my mom?</font>

256
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,640
<font color="yellow">I go often during her favorite hours.</font>

257
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,500
<font color="yellow">I like these hours the best.</font>

258
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,370
<font color="yellow">It's awkward to start anything. You feel awkward.</font>

259
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,370
<font color="yellow">You don't know if you're feeling hungry.</font>

260
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,100
<font color="yellow">You feel like someone will come or not.</font>

261
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,770
<font color="yellow">It's time for the tofu seller to come.</font>

262
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,270
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, let's go down a little later.</font>

263
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,340
<font color="yellow">Na Ri!</font>

264
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,540
<font color="yellow">- Snake! - Where? Where?</font>

265
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,370
<font color="yellow">Snake. Snake! Over there!</font>

266
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,300
<font color="yellow">Where? Where?</font>

267
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,670
<font color="yellow">Did you marry her because you were in love?</font>

268
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,370
<font color="yellow">Time's up.</font>

269
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,300
<font color="yellow">You're not answering instead of lying.</font>

270
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,370
<font color="yellow">I married her because I was in love.</font>

271
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,070
<font color="yellow">She didn't show it at work, but it must've been hard.</font>

272
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,670
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

273
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear from her directly, so...</font>

274
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
<font color="yellow">Then who called you?</font>

275
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,170
<font color="yellow">I don't know who, but I was told she left the ER...</font>

276
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,740
<font color="yellow">and to just come home.</font>

277
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,540
<font color="yellow">I'm glad. I guess it wasn't that serious.</font>

278
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,970
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

279
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

280
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,510
<font color="yellow">If I ask you to stay with me for a little while longer,</font>

281
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,010
<font color="yellow">can you do that for me?</font>

282
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,240
<font color="yellow">With you?</font>

283
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,570
<font color="yellow">You're swaying. Stupid.</font>

284
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,570
<font color="yellow">I wanted to say that just once.</font>

285
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
<font color="yellow">Be good to Na Ri.</font>

286
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,670
<font color="yellow">Don't cheat on her again.</font>

287
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,800
<font color="yellow">All I need is to see your face from time to time.</font>

288
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,440
<font color="yellow">Can't we do that, either?</font>

289
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
<font color="yellow">We can just make sure we don't get caught.</font>

290
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

291
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,740
<font color="yellow">Well, that is... Sure.</font>

292
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,070
<font color="yellow">We can be careful. Yes.</font>

293
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,340
<font color="yellow">That's right, but...</font>

294
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,740
<font color="yellow">I'd feel too bad.</font>

295
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,510
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

296
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,900
<font color="yellow">I have no pride.</font>

297
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,870
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hurt any more, either.</font>

298
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

299
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,370
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

300
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,900
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

301
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,470
<font color="yellow">I... Yeo Joo...</font>

302
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,010
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo! Wait.</font>

303
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,740
<font color="yellow">What did you do with Mom's things?</font>

304
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,010
<font color="yellow">- I took care of them. - That's my job.</font>

305
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,140
<font color="yellow">- The father comes first. - Stop saying that!</font>

306
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,440

309
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,040
<font color="yellow">Boss. Is everything okay?</font>

310
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,600
<font color="yellow">Is everything okay?</font>

311
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,040
<font color="yellow">You're okay.</font>

312
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,700
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

313
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,370
<font color="yellow">Right? The boss' daughter.</font>

314
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

315
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,970
<font color="yellow">Boss said his daughter was coming and waited every day.</font>

316
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,940
<font color="yellow">You came super late with a bang.</font>

317
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,740
<font color="yellow">But thank you.</font>

318
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,510
<font color="yellow">I heard you're a stewardess.</font>

319
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,140
<font color="yellow">I knew I'd meet a stewardess someday.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Then are you close to junior stewardesses? - No.</font>

<font color="yellow">My junior stewardess is my enemy.</font>

322
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Prepare the boxes.</font>

323
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,940
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

324
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,510
<font color="yellow">My hands are sore.</font>

325
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,700
<font color="yellow">Don't do it. Go in. Go in.</font>

326
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,070
<font color="yellow">I said to go in.</font>

327
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,470
<font color="yellow">What a daughter's daddy!</font>

328

<font color="yellow">Boss said his daughter was coming and waited every day.</font>

329
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,600
<font color="yellow">That punk really is a con artist and gigolo.</font>

330
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,300
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm sure you're hiding a lot of things.</font>

331
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,040
<font color="yellow">The layout changed.</font>

332
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,870

333
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that hurts.</font>

334
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,400
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

335
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,240
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

336
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,600
<font color="yellow">Is she kneading the dough because she's family?</font>

337
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,740
<font color="yellow">Throw these out.</font>

338
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,970
<font color="yellow">They're tainted, so throw them out!</font>

339
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,100
<font color="yellow">- Throw them out. - Tainted?</font>

341
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,340
<font color="yellow">Wow. There's so much tension between them.</font>

342
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,500
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

343
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,040
<font color="yellow">Don't go in there again.</font>

344
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,300
<font color="yellow">Why isn't it coming off?</font>

345
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,740
<font color="yellow">What were you looking for in my room?</font>

346
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,840
<font color="yellow">- What will make you feel better? - Mom's phone.</font>

347
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,200
<font color="yellow">I told you I put her things away.</font>

348
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,140
<font color="yellow">You're not looking for her phone.</font>

349
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,900
<font color="yellow">You probably want proof that I'm a con artist.</font>

350
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,200
<font color="yellow">But you won't find any because I'm not.</font>

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,240
<font color="yellow">Good people living average lives...</font>

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,040
<font color="yellow">don't lock their desk drawers like you.</font>

353
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,300
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring a shovel?</font>

354
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,640
<font color="yellow">Your uncle can't be reached,</font>

355
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,370
<font color="yellow">and you thought your house was abandoned.</font>

356
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,870
<font color="yellow">You lived here, so you know how quickly the weeds grow.</font>

357
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,070
<font color="yellow">That's why you bought a shovel.</font>

358
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,970
<font color="yellow">You were drunk, so you bought a huge one.</font>

359
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,470
<font color="yellow">But that wouldn't have sufficed.</font>

360
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,100
<font color="yellow">A vacant house crumbles quickly.</font>

361
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,270
<font color="yellow">It knows that it has been abandoned.</font>

362
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,500
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I abandoned this house?</font>

363
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,440
<font color="yellow">Uncle said he'd look after it and I needed time.</font>

364
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,300
<font color="yellow">What did you do while seasons changed?</font>

365
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,640
<font color="yellow">You must accept certain things even if it's hard.</font>

366
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,340
<font color="yellow">Even if you find something on me, it won't change...</font>

367
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,000
<font color="yellow">the fact that I'm your father and the house is mine.</font>

368
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,940
<font color="yellow">Your last name is Ko and mine is Hong.</font>

369
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,240
<font color="yellow">Stop saying you're my father. We're strangers.</font>

370
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,440
<font color="yellow">You were quick just as I wanted.</font>

371
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,170
<font color="yellow">- Then you can just leave. - Why would I leave?</font>

372
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,170
<font color="yellow">Why would strangers live together?</font>

373
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,240
<font color="yellow">- I'm Mom's only family. - No, I am.</font>

374
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,840
<font color="yellow">Hong Dumplings was for Hong Na Ri.</font>

375
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,640
<font color="yellow">Since I run it, I'm your father.</font>

376
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,370
<font color="yellow">To be more exact, I'm your stepdad.</font>

377
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,200
<font color="yellow">You seem strong now. Why don't you make dinner?</font>

378
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,400
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bring a guest.</font>

379
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,170
<font color="yellow">Were you talking to me?</font>

380
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,870
<font color="yellow">I have everything you need in the refrigerator,</font>

381
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,700
<font color="yellow">so I look forward to seeing...</font>

382
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
<font color="yellow">your cooking skills.</font>

383
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,770
<font color="yellow">Our chairman is so good at evading taxes.</font>

384
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,800
<font color="yellow">A robot museum.</font>

385
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,170
<font color="yellow">Isn't that romantic?</font>

386
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,770
<font color="yellow">We still haven't received the grant in certain areas.</font>

387
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,440
<font color="yellow">It's too soon to start the resort business.</font>

388
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
<font color="yellow">Just do it. We need to create waves so they'd give...</font>

389
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,870
<font color="yellow">permission to prevent conglomerates...</font>

390
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,300
<font color="yellow">from going bankrupt.</font>

391
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,440
<font color="yellow">That's it. This was the look she gave me.</font>

392
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,370
<font color="yellow">It was like I made her sick.</font>

393
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,540
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

394
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,140
<font color="yellow">what kind of person I am, so I understand.</font>

395
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,200
<font color="yellow">But it isn't easy to think that after just meeting me.</font>

396
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,800
<font color="yellow">Especially women near that age.</font>

397
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,900
<font color="yellow">She must know what you see isn't all.</font>

398
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,770
<font color="yellow">I know I'm annoying and a scumbag.</font>

399
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,970
<font color="yellow">That's why I hide it so well. I fool myself at times.</font>

400
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,100
<font color="yellow">Look into that unique woman.</font>

401
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,970
<font color="yellow">Her name is Hong Na Ri. She's Hong Dumplings' daughter.</font>

402
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,440
<font color="yellow">"I look forward to seeing your cooking"?</font>

403
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,570
<font color="yellow">Why that...</font>

404
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,040
<font color="yellow">What am I doing?</font>

405
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,470
<font color="yellow">Am I really going to do it?</font>

406
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,170
<font color="yellow">Mom, please clean.</font>

407
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,970
<font color="yellow">What a neat-freak. He's like a master in organizing.</font>

408
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,670
<font color="yellow">- Mom! - Gosh!</font>

409
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,040
<font color="yellow">You startled me. What?</font>

410
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,670
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the refrigerator?</font>

411
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,640
<font color="yellow">Don't change so suddenly. It's scary!</font>

412
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,300
<font color="yellow">I... I didn't do that.</font>

413
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,070
<font color="yellow">People don't change that easily. Don't worry.</font>

414
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,400
<font color="yellow">Mom,</font>

415
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,340
<font color="yellow">is this situation for real?</font>

416
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,270
<font color="yellow">Did he think I couldn't do it?</font>

417
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,770
<font color="yellow">What's with the suit?</font>

418
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,370
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

419
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,500
<font color="yellow">He is my stepdad. He is my stepdad.</font>

420
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,040
<font color="yellow">He is my stepdad.</font>

421
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,270
<font color="yellow">Well... Father...</font>

422
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,740
<font color="yellow">Dinner's ready.</font>

423
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,340
<font color="yellow">The guest is being late. Would you like to wait longer?</font>

424
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,140
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you hungry? - Excuse me?</font>

425
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,000
<font color="yellow">No. Let's wait a while longer.</font>

426
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,100
<font color="yellow">Would you like a drink while waiting?</font>

427
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,700
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

428
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,770
<font color="yellow">- Is it an important guest? - Of course.</font>

429
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,800
<font color="yellow">My mom could only grow weeds. You're not bad.</font>

430
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,170
<font color="yellow">The garden is her style.</font>

431
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,400
<font color="yellow">She liked baby's breath, too.</font>

432
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,140
<font color="yellow">They're buckwheat flowers.</font>

433
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,700
<font color="yellow">What? I see, buckwheat flowers.</font>

434
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,070
<font color="yellow">Your tie got loosened.</font>

435
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,840
<font color="yellow">I've decided to accept you.</font>

436
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,040
<font color="yellow">I trust Mom's choice.</font>

437
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,770
<font color="yellow">I felt like she had a secret.</font>

438
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,300
<font color="yellow">If I had been a better daughter,</font>

439
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,740
<font color="yellow">she probably would've told me first.</font>

440
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,240
<font color="yellow">You were a good daughter. She said you were the best.</font>

441
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,770
<font color="yellow">That's nice to hear.</font>

442
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,600
<font color="yellow">Let's get along.</font>

443
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,000
<font color="yellow">It's not like we'll see each other often, though.</font>

444
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,440
<font color="yellow">Na Ri. What are you doing?</font>

445
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,040
<font color="yellow">Here's my son-in-law!</font>

446
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,470
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came.</font>

447
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,170
<font color="yellow">Son-in-law?</font>

448
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,270
<font color="yellow">The funeral. The fixer.</font>

449
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,740
<font color="yellow">The fixer?</font>

450
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,240
<font color="yellow">I thought you worked at the funeral place.</font>

451
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,640
<font color="yellow">You were family.</font>

452
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,500
<font color="yellow">No wonder you worked so hard.</font>

453
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,040
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? - Are you okay?</font>

454
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,970
<font color="yellow">- I heard you went to the ER. - How did you know?</font>

455
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
<font color="yellow">I called him.</font>

456
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,870
<font color="yellow">So you're the one who called.</font>

457
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,200
<font color="yellow">But did you just talk down to Na Ri...</font>

458
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,300
<font color="yellow">Who gave you his number? Did you go through my phone?</font>

459
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,900
<font color="yellow">I got his business card at the funeral.</font>

460
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,000
<font color="yellow">- Why do you keep talking down... - Regardless.</font>

461
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,600
<font color="yellow">How could you do this without asking?</font>

462
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,700
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say.</font>

463
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,240
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

464
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,770
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

465
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,370
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep talking down...</font>

466
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,770
<font color="yellow">He worked hard at the funeral like family.</font>

467
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,270
<font color="yellow">Everyone considers him family.</font>

468
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,640
<font color="yellow">He's the one person you can lean on.</font>

469
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,400
<font color="yellow">He should know you went to the ER.</font>

470
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,240
<font color="yellow">I have no desire to lean on anyone.</font>

471
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you speaking formally...</font>

472
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,500
<font color="yellow">Did you make a big mistake?</font>

473
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

474
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,940
<font color="yellow">- Why is he talking down to me? - Stay out of it.</font>

475
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,370
<font color="yellow">- Just leave. - No. Take her with you.</font>

476
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,770
<font color="yellow">"Take her with you"? Are you talking to me?</font>

477
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,400
<font color="yellow">Take her to a big hospital in Seoul to get tested.</font>

478
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,170
<font color="yellow">They say it's stress. Don't stress her out...</font>

479
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,300
<font color="yellow">I said no. What kind of father does that?</font>

480
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,870
<font color="yellow">- Why you... - Father?</font>

481
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,200
<font color="yellow">I said no, so don't do this again.</font>

482
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,840
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

483
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,300
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

484
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,540
<font color="yellow">- Why that... - Hey, you!</font>

485
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,700
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

486
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about calling...</font>

487
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,000
<font color="yellow">without asking.</font>

488
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,770
<font color="yellow">I said I'd accept you out of my trust for my mom.</font>

489
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,240
<font color="yellow">If you're my father, you should at least punch him.</font>

490
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,540
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

491
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,770
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what's going on.</font>

492
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,270
<font color="yellow">Would you explain it to me?</font>

493
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,870
<font color="yellow">You should leave for today.</font>

494
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,910
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, are you stupid?</font>

495
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,840
<font color="yellow">- You're just so stupid! - How dare you come in here?</font>

496
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,340
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

497
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,740
<font color="yellow">I know you're angry, but let me talk.</font>

498
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,500
<font color="yellow">Stay out of my business and leave.</font>

499
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,770
<font color="yellow">How could I not care?</font>

500
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,500
<font color="yellow">Was she out of her mind?</font>

501
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,840
<font color="yellow">Whom are you talking about?</font>

502
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,270
<font color="yellow">He seduced your innocent mother.</font>

503
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,100
<font color="yellow">He's obviously a con artist!</font>

504
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,440
<font color="yellow">Are you stupid? Why are you being polite to him?</font>

505
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,670
<font color="yellow">What does he want? Does he want money?</font>

506
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,700
<font color="yellow">Does he plan to live here?</font>

507
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,040
<font color="yellow">What? Why are you packing?</font>

508
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,370
<font color="yellow">Did he say this is his house? Did he tell you to leave?</font>

509
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,910
<font color="yellow">- Why that... - Stay out of it.</font>

510
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,640
<font color="yellow">And don't insult my mom. I trust her.</font>

511
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,740
<font color="yellow">You're pathetic.</font>

512
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
<font color="yellow">You know.</font>

513
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,370
<font color="yellow">You feel it too.</font>

514
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,170
<font color="yellow">It's obvious to anyone.</font>

515
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,270
<font color="yellow">Your mother fell for a young gigolo!</font>

516
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,540
<font color="yellow">Did your mother really die in a car accident?</font>

517
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,440
<font color="yellow">Do you know how the accident occurred?</font>

518
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,700
<font color="yellow">What about your uncle?</font>

519
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
<font color="yellow">Since when did you lose touch with him?</font>

520
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,100
<font color="yellow">(Are you in a meeting? I feel bad.)</font>

521
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,840
<font color="yellow">Why is she texting in pieces?</font>

522
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,870
<font color="yellow">(How's Na Ri? Is she okay? Call me after.)</font>

523
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,570
<font color="yellow">It must be going well. You're texting while exercising.</font>

524
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,640
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

525
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,570
<font color="yellow">He lied that he had a meeting...</font>

526
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,570
<font color="yellow">and went to see his old girlfriend.</font>

527
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,970
<font color="yellow">- I played dumb. - But you look happy.</font>

528
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,570
<font color="yellow">He's lying to me.</font>

529
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,040
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

530
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,870
<font color="yellow">He used to talk about his girlfriend openly.</font>

531
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,770
<font color="yellow">That meant I couldn't call when he was with her.</font>

532
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,740
<font color="yellow">But now, he's lying to me.</font>

533
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,500
<font color="yellow">I'm his first now.</font>

534
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,870
<font color="yellow">Lucky you. You're his first.</font>

535
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,000
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

536
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,040
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Do you know how much this house is worth?</font>

537
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,410
<font color="yellow">Are you here to valuate our house?</font>

538
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,070
<font color="yellow">This is a hot spot.</font>

539
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,170
<font color="yellow">Resorts are lined up to develop this area.</font>

540
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,440
<font color="yellow">He knew that and conned her.</font>

541
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,910
<font color="yellow">He planned it from the start. Hey. Wait.</font>

542
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,670
<font color="yellow">What about the 30,000 dollars?</font>

543
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,140
<font color="yellow">- I'll pay you back. - Why would you pay for that?</font>

544
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,740
<font color="yellow">This house is yours.</font>

545
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,040
<font color="yellow">Even if you end it with me, protect this house.</font>

546
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,170
<font color="yellow">Did you say you trust your mom's choice?</font>

547
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,340
<font color="yellow">Don't be so naive.</font>

548
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,670
<font color="yellow">Your mom and you were fooled because of that!</font>

549
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,740
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

550
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,470
<font color="yellow">Come and eat so you can take your medicine.</font>

551
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

552
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,940
<font color="yellow">Hey. You.</font>

553
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,640
<font color="yellow">You overheard us, didn't you?</font>

554
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,200
<font color="yellow">You feel guilty, don't you?</font>

555
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,410
<font color="yellow">You chose the wrong target for your con.</font>

556
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,410
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many lawyers and judges I know?</font>

557
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,570
<font color="yellow">I don't care, so I won't ask.</font>

558
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,170
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

559
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,570
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go knead.</font>

560
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,540
<font color="yellow">Don't even try.</font>

561
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,440
<font color="yellow">Pack your things and get out, you con artist gigolo!</font>

562
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,170
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

563
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,410
<font color="yellow">It's my building. I told you not to lock your door.</font>

564
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,070
<font color="yellow">I heard you're skipping school.</font>

565
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,670
<font color="yellow">It's your life, so I don't really care.</font>

566
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,300
<font color="yellow">But come to think of it, I need to take over this town.</font>

567
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,770
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty famous.</font>

568
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,970
<font color="yellow">So my sister can't be like this.</font>

569
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,200
<font color="yellow">I'm confiscating this. Why?</font>

570
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,470
<font color="yellow">Because you didn't buy anything in here.</font>

571
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,770
<font color="yellow">Each time you miss class, I'll confiscate each item.</font>

572
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,240
<font color="yellow">Let's negotiate.</font>

573
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,170
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - I get one warning and you return it.</font>

574
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,200
<font color="yellow">- Today is a warning. - Fine. Today is a warning.</font>

575
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,840
<font color="yellow">But if you skip again, you and this room are gone.</font>

576
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,300
<font color="yellow">This is what you call a negotiation. Or a threat.</font>

577
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,800
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Seoul.</font>

578
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,640
<font color="yellow">Don't try anything or you're dead.</font>

579
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,070
<font color="yellow">Let's get along.</font>

580
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,410
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

581
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,670
<font color="yellow">- Give me your number. - Okay.</font>

582
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,670
<font color="yellow">If I were the sky</font>

583
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,300
<font color="yellow">I would like to tinge your face.</font>

584
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,800
<font color="yellow">Just like the red glow tinging the evening</font>

585
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,700
<font color="yellow">I would like to tinge your cheeks.</font>

586
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:16,000
<font color="yellow">If I were a poet</font>

587
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,340
<font color="yellow">I would sing for you.</font>

588
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,240
<font color="yellow">Just like a little child nestling in its mom's bosom</font>

589
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,140
<font color="yellow">I would like to sing happily.</font>

590
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,000
<font color="yellow">- Sing for me. - What?</font>

591
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,900
<font color="yellow">You must know it. Mom sang it all the time.</font>

592
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,900
<font color="yellow">Who? Me?</font>

593
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,640
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

594
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,140
<font color="yellow">- I... - Yes! Go on.</font>

595
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:09,600
<font color="yellow">If I were the sky</font>

596
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,700
<font color="yellow">I would like to tinge your face.</font>

597
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,300
<font color="yellow">What do you do when you miss Mom?</font>

598
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,300
<font color="yellow">I close my eyes...</font>

599
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,500
<font color="yellow">and say, "I miss you." Then I see her.</font>

600
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,500
<font color="yellow">She's always smiling.</font>

601
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,600
<font color="yellow">I'm going to catch the last bus.</font>

602
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,300
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

603
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,840
<font color="yellow">- You look happy that I'm leaving. - No, not at all.</font>

604
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,240
<font color="yellow">- I'll pick up my things later. - Okay, okay.</font>

605
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,040
<font color="yellow">No, I mean... You can leave them.</font>

606
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,070
<font color="yellow">Go to a hospital in Seoul. Don't be stressed.</font>

607
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,570
<font color="yellow">Eat and sleep well.</font>

608
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,840
<font color="yellow">Look at you. You have dark circles, your skin is dry,</font>

609
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,970
<font color="yellow">and you have wrinkles...</font>

610
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,640

<font color="yellow">You're so extreme. Seriously.</font>

764
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,070
<font color="yellow">Does he owe more than the value of the house?</font>

765
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,070
<font color="yellow">They say those debts grow like snowballs.</font>

766
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,840
<font color="yellow">What will we do about my uncle?</font>

767
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,070
<font color="yellow">Discard him.</font>

768
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,170
<font color="yellow">Just discard him.</font>

769
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,740
<font color="yellow">He's your mom's brother, so I'll take care of him.</font>

770
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,440
<font color="yellow">You discard him from that brain of yours.</font>

771
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,440
<font color="yellow">Don't say your back hurts or you can't see again.</font>

772
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,600
<font color="yellow">Go in and rest. I have to knead dough.</font>

773
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,140
<font color="yellow">You're always kneading dough.</font>

774
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,970
<font color="yellow">I sell dumplings. Kneading is my life!</font>

775
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,100
<font color="yellow">I should go knead. Knead!</font>

776
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,170
<font color="yellow">He isn't kneading.</font>

777
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,670
<font color="yellow">I told you never to call.</font>

778
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,600
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

779
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,270
<font color="yellow">I told you never to step foot here again.</font>

780
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,440
<font color="yellow">It's my final warning.</font>

781
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,640
<font color="yellow">If you do this again,</font>

782
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,640
<font color="yellow">I can't say what will happen to you.</font>

783
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,940
<font color="yellow">You know I always keep my word.</font>

784
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,740
<font color="yellow">(Sweet Stranger and Me)</font>

785
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,100
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, Nan Gil is a bad man.</font>

786
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,340
<font color="yellow">You're so stiff. Why do you trust him?</font>

787
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,240
<font color="yellow">You can't fake your expressions. I trust that.</font>

788
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,370
<font color="yellow">No, this is all an act. Don't believe anything.</font>

789
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,940
<font color="yellow">Did she say I'm a gold digger and a con artist?</font>

790
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,840
<font color="yellow">No. There's a money matter remaining.</font>

791
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,700
<font color="yellow">Did she borrow money from you? I'll go with you.</font>

792
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,570
<font color="yellow">It may get dirty. It's all about money.</font>

793
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,270
<font color="yellow">They may degrade your mother and family.</font>

794
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,900
<font color="yellow">I came to see your daughter.</font>

795
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,500
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong! Come inside. Come in.</font>

796
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,870
<font color="yellow">May I go in my room then?</font>

797
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,770
<font color="yellow">What does your father do?</font>

798
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,000
<font color="yellow">Do you have siblings? Do you come from a happy family?</font>

799
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,300
<font color="yellow">Look, Nan Gil.</font>

800
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

801
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,270
<font color="yellow">What? Do you want some water?</font>
