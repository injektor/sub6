82
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,620

87

90
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,330

92
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae. I just got a call from Detective Hong.</font>

93
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Chi Hyeon died.</font>

94
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,240
<font color=#FFFF00>He originally gave me two doses of wolfsbane root.</font>

95
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,520
<font color=#FFFF00>But, I said I didn't need both of them and switched out the one that I took.</font>

96
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,260
<font color=#FFFF00>But it seems Heo Chi Hyeon had the remaining one</font>

97
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,380
<font color=#FFFF00>and drank it.</font>

98
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,480
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so potent if taken orally, it just takes more time</font>

99
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,850
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's still fatal.</font>

100
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,900
<font color=#FFFF00>He's so irresponsible till the end.</font>

101
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's the guardian?</font>

102
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,100
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me.</font>

103
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Did the surgery go well, Doctor?</font>

104
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... we should look at it like it went well.</font>

105
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,760
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't the level of "well" but a miracle.</font>

106
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,410
<font color=#FFFF00>The bullet went through the right ventricle and the left ventricle.</font>

107
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I have never seen someone live from this.</font>

108
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen a case like this at school either.</font>

109
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever seen this?</font>

110
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

111
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,040
<font color=#FFFF00>There was a lot of blood loss, and her blood pressure dropped very low as well.</font>

112
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,370
<font color=#FFFF00>In these cases, they usually go in shock so I put on the heart-lung machine.</font>

113
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,530
<font color=#FFFF00>But after I stitched up the pierced part,</font>

114
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,360
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not normally like this.</font>

115
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,310
<font color=#FFFF00>But the heart returned very easily.</font>

116
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,520
<font color=#FFFF00>What about her vital signs?</font>

117
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,200
<font color=#FFFF00>That also isn't normally like this.</font>

118
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,070
<font color=#FFFF00>They are rapidly stabilizing.</font>

119
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Well of course, the location of the bullet is quite critical,</font>

120
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,250
<font color=#FFFF00>so we need to keep an eye on her to see when she regains consciousness.</font>

121
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

122
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now is very important.</font>

123
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Because there was already a lot of blood loss, if the circulation to the brain decreases,</font>

124
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,420
<font color=#FFFF00>since we can't exclude the possibility of loss of brain function...</font>

125
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk again after she regains her consciousness.</font>

126
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand.</font>

127
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,280
<font color=#FFFF00>But this patient normally doesn't eat anything especially weird, right?</font>

128
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Rather than eating something weird, she especially eats a lot.</font>

129
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</font>

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,100
<font color=#FFFF00>-I thought they were close to each other, but I guess not.<br>-It seems so.</font>

144
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,040
<font color=#FFFF00>-About what?<br>-Your friend!</font>

145
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo Ran's son Heo Joon Jae.</font>

146
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,370
<font color=#FFFF00>-What about Joon Jae?<br>-The adoptive son of that household</font>

147
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,500
<font color=#FFFF00>shot at the biological son Heo Joon Jae,</font>

148
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,540
<font color=#FFFF00>and the girlfriend took that gunshot instead of him.</font>

149
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it like a movie? Right? They're at the hospital right now.</font>

150
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,590
<font color=#FFFF00>They left early in the morning to see the surgery results.</font>

151
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,690
<font color=#FFFF00>You should watch the news! The news!</font>

152
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,830
<font color=#FFFF00>You said the surgery went well, but why isn't she regaining her consciousness?</font>

153
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Because it's a big surgery, it must be taking some time.</font>

154
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she talk about it to do this?</font>

155
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,520
<font color=#FFFF00>What talk?</font>

156
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,210
<font color=#FFFF00><i>In just a few days, your face got so gaunt.</i></font>

157
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,100
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Eat this.</i></font>

158
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,600
<font color=#FFFF00><i>-Mom, you know about the Little Mermaid story, right?<br>-I do.</i></font>

159
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,540
<font color=#FFFF00><i>In the end, the mermaid gets a knife, right?</i></font>

160
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,870
<font color=#FFFF00><i>If she kills the prince with the knife, she would live,</i></font>

161
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,830
<font color=#FFFF00><i>but if she fails to kill him, she becomes a bubble and disappears.</i></font>

162
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,800
<font color=#FFFF00><i>What would you do?</i></font>

163
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,370
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Why are you asking that?</i></font>

164
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,320
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I think it's right for the mermaid to disappear,</i></font>

165
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,720
<font color=#FFFF00><i>because it's a story that the mermaid started</i></font>

166
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,660
<font color=#FFFF00><i>with her greed to come up the shores.</i></font>

167
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,730
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That's not how I think.</i></font>

168
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,970
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Why?</i></font>

169
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,650
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Long ago, a young man went out to sea, but the ship got overturned.</i></font>

170
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,130
<font color=#FFFF00><i>He met the mermaid and she saved his life.</i></font>

171
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,380
<font color=#FFFF00><i>He married the mermaid and had babies.</i></font>

172
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,730
<font color=#FFFF00><i>They lived happily.</i></font>

173
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,220
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The children who were born through the human and the mermaid,</i></font>

174
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,410
<font color=#FFFF00><i>some returned to the water, and some remained on land.</i></font>

175
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,950
<font color=#FFFF00><i>One became the village people's benefactor.</i></font>

176
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,330
<font color=#FFFF00><i>While communicating with the mermaids of the sea, when there was a storm</i></font>

177
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,570
<font color=#FFFF00><i>he was told in advance not to go to sea.</i></font>

178
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,310
<font color=#FFFF00><i>There's this mermaid story too.</i></font>

179
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:41,330
<font color=#FFFF00><i>It's not greed that the mermaid went up onto the shores but of love.</i></font>

180
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,930
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Although it would be nice to have all stories a happy ending,</i></font>

181
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,200
<font color=#FFFF00><i>but there are stories that aren't.</i></font>

182
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,280
<font color=#FFFF00>She talked about that?</font>

183
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. So with this event having happened,</font>

184
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,150
<font color=#FFFF00>my heart hurts a lot.</font>

185
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,180
<font color=#FFFF00>I need her to quickly wake up so that I can say thank you.</font>

186
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,870
<font color=#FFFF00>How did she think of running in front of a gun?</font>

187
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,590
<font color=#FFFF00><i>You could just easily get shot.</i></font>

188
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,620
<font color=#FFFF00><i>No. You can't. You'll die like a dolphin.</i></font>

189
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,800
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying. The person who was so scared of a gun</font>

190
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
<font color=#FFFF00>had no fear.</font>

191
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,810
<font color=#FFFF00>But, Mother, is there really a legend like that?</font>

192
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he really marry the mermaid and have babies</font>

193
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,220
<font color=#FFFF00>and happily live for a long, long time?</font>

194
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you not remember?</font>

195
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,050
<font color=#FFFF00>When you were little and said you couldn't sleep, I would always tell you that story.</font>

196
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,080
<font color=#FFFF00>You liked it so much.</font>

197
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

198
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,050
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be nice if that was true.</font>

199
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,430
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way. Because I'm here, would you take that to Department Head Nam's wife?</font>

200
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

201
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going? Wanna go together?</font>

202
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

203
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,200
<font color=#FFFF00>-Ahjummonim.<br>-Oh, Joon Jae!</font>

204
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,720
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the news. How could this have happened?</font>

205
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,410
<font color=#FFFF00>The surgery ended well.</font>

206
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,560
<font color=#FFFF00>-He's a close Hyung.<br>-Ah, yes.</font>

207
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. I've heard a lot about you from Joon Jae.</font>

208
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,260
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a good impression.</font>

209
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I've seen him a lot somewhere.</font>

210
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,800
<font color=#FFFF00>When you go straight on this road and pass the hill, there will be a place which is the Bangcheon Inn.</font>

211
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

212
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,530

214
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280

215
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,630

217
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,380
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hurry.</i></font>

218
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,740
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Thank you.</i></font>

219
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- My mother asked me to give this to you. <br> - You didn't have to. I'm so thankful.</font>

220
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,430
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't skip meals. <br>- Okay. Thank you.</font>

221
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh!</font>

230
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I dreamed a very long dream.</font>

231
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,820
<font color=#FFFF00>It's good that you woke up.</font>

232
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Back then and even now,</font>

233
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,290
<font color=#FFFF00>thank you for being my friend.</font>

234
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she not waking up?</font>

235
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,380
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying. They definitely said the surgery went well.</font>

236
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there something definitely different than us, neurologically or so?</font>

237
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,220
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

238
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,370
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, I heard the conversation between you guys.</font>

239
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,420
<font color=#FFFF00>That you to Cheong... about mermaid and things like that.</font>

240
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hah! It was a joke. Do you believe that? Are you joking?</font>

241
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, right? Our house isn't even some cartoon park or something. I don't know why I believe this,</font>

242
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,940
<font color=#FFFF00>but I believe it. Cheong isn't like us.</font>

243
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,400
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a mermaid.</font>

244
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, don't be nervous! You think I'll do something to your girlfriend?</font>

245
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, you could do more than that.</font>

246
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, it's true that I may be a guy whose eyes become blinded by money, but I keep true to two principles.</font>

247
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,640
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

248
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I, without fail, pay back my enemies. I pay back my debts if possible.</font>

249
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Although, Cheong didn't save me</font>

250
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,080
<font color=#FFFF00>But she protected my Joon Jae. My Joon Jae.</font>

251
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, so would I do anything to Cheong?</font>

252
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,910
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean "my Joon Jae?" Are you crazy?</font>

253
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Hah! You're saying outrageous things! So cringe-worthy.</font>

254
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, and this was sincere but after saying it I feel all cringey too.</font>

255
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Joon Jae is my Joon Jae. Don't mess with him.</font>

256
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,660
<font color=#FFFF00>You woke up, Cheong?</font>

258
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,660

259
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,820

260

261

<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

262
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,220
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you'd meet a prettier woman and live and eat well.</font>

263
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,940
<font color=#FFFF00>There's none that is prettier than you no matter how much I search.</font>

264
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,510
<font color=#FFFF00>You looked?</font>

265
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,520

266

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Yes, this is Jin Kyung.</i></font>

283
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,460
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Ma Dae Young?</i></font>

284
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae, Ma Dae Young is coming this way.</font>

285
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'll go over there right now.</font>

286
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, Hyung. It's me. Contact Detective Hong.</font>

287
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma Dae Young is going to Professor Jin Kyung.</font>

288
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you not remember anything?</font>

289
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,530
<font color=#FFFF00>I only remember from the time I met that girl.</font>

290
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,510
<font color=#FFFF00>But... why do you suddenly want to search for your memories?</font>

291
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever wandered without your memories?</font>

292
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,200
<font color=#FFFF00>The feeling of being trapped in the woods with your two eyes covered but hearing the sound of animals from all around.</font>

293
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,840
<font color=#FFFF00>The fear of being eaten by that animal is not what's hard, but the fear of not knowing when and where what will come jumping out at you.</font>

294
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,070
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what makes me crazier.</font>

295
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,090
<font color=#FFFF00>At times, couldn't the fear be better than the reality?</font>

296
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,040
<font color=#FFFF00>No, but I still have to know. I can't live like this anymore.</font>

297
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of a sin that I can't even remember</font>

298
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't live paying the punishment.</font>

299
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,590
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Husband Cheon.</i></font>

300
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,230
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Husband Cheon, I heard you can tell fortunes better than most shamans out there. </i></font>

301
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,670
<font color=#FFFF00><i>It's not that I have any special powers of divination, </i></font>

302
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,260
<font color=#FFFF00><i>it's only that I have a lot of interest in others' fates.</i></font>

303
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,950
<font color=#FFFF00><i> Anyhow, read our fortune for the new year. </i></font>

304
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,210
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The beautiful flowers that pierced the harsh snow and bloomed everywhere</i></font>

305
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,820
<font color=#FFFF00><i>are all yours.</i></font>

306
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,890
<font color=#FFFF00><i>They're all mine, the beautiful flowers?</i></font>

307
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,280
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Why? They're not gold and treasures</i>?</font>

308
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,180
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The captivating scent of those flowers</i></font>

309
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,630
<font color=#FFFF00><i>permeate your body's crevices, until you die</i></font>

310
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:54,590
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Even if they die and are reborn, they will not leave each other and will be together.</i></font>

311
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,850
<font color=#FFFF00>It's something good, right?</font>

312
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:08,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Sin cannot determine fate's good and evil.</font>

313
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, what about me?</font>

314
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,530
<font color=#FFFF00>A tree hit by lightning still has spirit left so grows again</font>

315
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you receiving the punishment so you can live? Or are you living so you can receive the punishment?</font>

316
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,470
<font color=#FFFF00>You will live a confusing life.</font>

317
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,070
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

318
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,670
<font color=#FFFF00>So, you might as well get hit by lightning and burn into black ashes.</font>

319
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,700
<font color=#FFFF00>It would have been better to not have been born again</font>

320
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,420
<font color=#FFFF00>but this is also a fate you have no choice in.</font>

321
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,430
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a shame.</font>

322
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:02,740
<font color=#FFFF00>This rascal...</font>

323
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave!</font>

324
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Get whoever.</font>

325
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know Park No Joon?</font>

326
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,230
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never heard of, or met, or seen that person.</font>

327
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,240
<font color=#FFFF00>His ship was forcibly held at the port, so he had to stay here for 20 days,</font>

328
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,220
<font color=#FFFF00>and was found as a cold corpse just because he traveled through that part of the sea.</font>

329
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,170
<font color=#FFFF00><i>You wretched thief!</i></font>

330
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,780
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Even if you block the path and commit highway robbery, how could you do this?</i></font>

331
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,250
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Did you think you were making that long trip back and forth to China to fatten your belly?</i></font>

332
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,400
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'm going to expose your crimes to everyone!</i></font>

333
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,820
<font color=#FFFF00>A man has died!</font>

334
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,120
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a person who has died!</font>

335
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I am his son, Park Moo. This is for my father,</font>

336
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,430
<font color=#FFFF00>and for Kim Dam Ryeong.</font>

337
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,230
<font color=#FFFF00>I will definitely be born again.</font>

338
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:43,030
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be reborn and whatever I didn't own in this world,</font>

339
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:49,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I will definitely own all of them.</font>

340
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:54,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do so. No matter how many times you reincarnate,</font>

341
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I will avenge just as many times.</font>

342
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,230
<font color=#FFFF00>This woman put poison in my father's drink?</font>

343
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I have prepared a poison worthy for you.</font>

344
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:29,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what wolfsbane flower is? It is a beautiful flower which produces a deadly poison.</font>

345
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Receive it.</font>

346
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw it.</font>

347
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,220
<font color=#FFFF00>In my past life, me, Dam Ryeong, mermaid.</font>

348
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,030
<font color=#FFFF00>And you. You always knew.</font>

349
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Just like how I received punishment in this life,</font>

350
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,160
<font color=#FFFF00>the fate I must fulfill.</font>

351
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,200
<font color=#FFFF00>You circled around me and just watched?</font>

352
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Whose side are you on?</font>

353
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,130
<font color=#FFFF00>You were like that then, and you are like that now.</font>

354
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just someone who observes fate.</font>

355
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I am on no one's side.</font>

356
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:56,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah. You knew it all. Right?</font>

357
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor!</font>

358
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:32,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Remember. I have won against you two again.</font>

359
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Fate...</font>

360
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,250
<font color=#FFFF00>will be on my side this time as well. In this life,</font>

361
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,360
<font color=#FFFF00>in the end, everything will repeat.</font>

362
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,070
<font color=#FFFF00>A hopeless love between human and wicked.</font>

363
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Misery would be waiting at the end of that.</font>

364
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,790
<font color=#FFFF00>It does not matter whose side fate is on.</font>

365
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,520
<font color=#FFFF00>In the end of that ill-fate, we were together, so we were happy. It is the same now.</font>

366
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae!</font>

367
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae!</font>

368
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Put that down!</font>

369
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,860
<font color=#FFFF00>I have finally caught you.</font>

370
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Put your hands up!</font>

371
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae, are you alright?</font>

372
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he glaring at me? It's our first meeting.</font>

373
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my, that scared me!</font>

374
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,750
<font color=#FFFF00>So unexpected from you. Are you here to visit me? With flowers?</font>

375
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

376
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you were unconscious, so I was just going to leave the flowers.</font>

377
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you worried about me right now?</font>

378
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I wouldn't say that but...</font>

379
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly, it's my first time seeing someone who got shot.</font>

380
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really get shot? Oh my, what to do? It must've really hurt.</font>

381
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,250
<font color=#FFFF00>So, where did you get hit?</font>

382
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,860
<font color=#FFFF00>It sort of sounds like you're enjoying this.</font>

383
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, are you insane?</font>

384
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really like you, but it's not like I hate you to the point that I would be glad you got shot.</font>

385
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, do you like me?</font>

386
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. It's not that I totally like you.</font>

387
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I like you though.</font>

388
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you're quite straight forward.</font>

389
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,530
<font color=#FFFF00>But why?</font>

390
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I always wanted to be like you.</font>

391
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, it shouldn't be easy becoming like me. But why?</font>

392
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,820
<font color=#FFFF00>You can grow old with the person you like.</font>

393
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying I'm old?</font>

394
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I look young for my age. I'm not the type who'll grow old with someone.</font>

395
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Not that, but I'm jealous.</font>

396
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,240
<font color=#FFFF00>You can spend lots of time with the person you like.</font>

397
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,130
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I do when I have lots of time? The person I want to spend time with only looks at you.</font>

398
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, you only dream such small dreams. I'm envious of you.</font>

399
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Your fated person will appear.</font>

400
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get possessed by a spirit after getting shot? What's with you?</font>

401
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,860
<font color=#FFFF00>I have waited a long time, and they appeared.</font>

402
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,170
<font color=#FFFF00>So, yours will appear as well.</font>

403
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:30,390
<font color=#FFFF00>You're telling me to stay away from Joon Jae, right? I was going to do that without you telling me anyway.</font>

404
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,450
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll even get shot for Heo Joon Jae. How can I beat that?</font>

405
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Get well soon.</font>

423
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm being generous.</font>

424
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,460
<font color=#FFFF00>You gotta have some proper pictures. You always get sneak shots.</font>

425
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,770
<font color=#FFFF00>What the heck?</font>

426
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't all of these pictures of Cheong?</font>

427
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here you!</font>

428
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,800
<font color=#FFFF00>So the one you liked was not me but Unni Cheong? Was that it?</font>

429
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why did you confess that you like me?</font>

430
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,900
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is, the boss...</font>

431
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,200
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What did you do to me? Did you put on a show? Why didn't you tell me?</font>

432
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it fun seeing me like that? I didn't even know you were playing with me,</font>

433
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,530
<font color=#FFFF00>and I took care of your heart so that you wouldn't be damaged</font>

434
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,600
<font color=#FFFF00>when I rejected you!</font>

435
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,980
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you don't follow me!</font>

436
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,750
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

437
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Noona.</font>

438
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:52,200
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>It becomes clear now. That everything will be for the two of us</i>♬</font>

439
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:59,250
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>once more was not accidental.</i>♬</font>

440
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:05,570
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>Forever we had to meet .</i>♬</font>

441
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:11,150
<font color=#FFFF00>The area of the injury stopped bleeding so I checked the wound, but</font>

442
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,490
<font color=#FFFF00>there was nothing to bandage.</font>

443
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,270
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nonsense. Are you sure you didn't see wrong? How could a bullet wound disappear that quickly?</font>

444
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,320
<font color=#FFFF00>The doctors in the operating room are in a ruckus as well.</font>

445
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,780
<font color=#FFFF00>At first. the bleeding was so excessive. Everyone was nervous, just in case the aorta (major part of the heart) was ruptured.</font>

446
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,230
<font color=#FFFF00>But, the wound was completely clean.</font>

447
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? What is this? It's scary.</font>

448
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Perhaps, is it something like that? Alien?</font>

449
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
<font color=#FFFF00>That's going a bit far.</font>

450
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,900
<font color=#FFFF00>- Zombie?<br>- Vampire.</font>

451
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, the Chief said he'll report the case at the Heart Association and the AHA</font>

452
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,670
<font color=#FFFF00>and donate to the circulation of the magazine. He's really excited.</font>

453
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he contacted the reporter as well.</font>

454
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, are we being broadcasted?</font>

455
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Just get to work.</font>

456
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

457
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you alright?</font>

458
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. Did you get the pass to get out?</font>

459
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Please be careful.</font>

460
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,990
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Staff Only</i></font>

461
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,010
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Myeongsung College Hospital Records</i></font>

462
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,800
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Search</i></font>

463
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,400
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Delete patient records.</i></font>

464
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,280
<font color=#FFFF00><i>No records for this patient.</i></font>

465
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheong. Cheong.</font>

466
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home.</font>

467
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,010
<font color=#FFFF00>- Go home ? <br> - Yeah.</font>

468
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Second Floor Room.</font>

469
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,110
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is it? <br> - Well, as I see it, if Mom moves in,</font>

470
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she needs to use this room. Then I don't have a room. Even though I'm the home owner.</font>

471
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,970
<font color=#FFFF00>So, you and I should stay together in one room.</font>

472
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,990
<font color=#FFFF00>But, when I thought about it,</font>

473
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I wondered if there was a need to wait until Mom moved here.</font>

474
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Right? Should I go up?</font>

475
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:57,840
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

476
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,900
<font color=#FFFF00>So that's it. I'll go up.</font>

477
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:17,840
<font color=#FFFF00>How long ago was it when you barged down here and stayed with me when I told you not to come?</font>

478
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,080
<font color=#FFFF00>She's changed.</font>

479
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:37,330
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i> Although I can't tell you everything </i>♬</font>

480
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,000
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i> about your loneliness </i></font>

481
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:50,890
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i> Without saying anything just bear it. </i>♬♬</font>

482
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:57,350
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i> If I could give you a hug</i></font>

483
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,270
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i> Without any reason </i>♬</font>

484
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, Unni. What am I going to do because of my sadness?</font>

485
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll see you often. It's not that far away either.</font>

486
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,270
<font color=#FFFF00>This is your son's place? Your son lives in a nice home.</font>

487
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for dropping me off here. Be careful on your way back.</font>

488
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,200
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't even invite me in, when that's the reason I came here.</font>

489
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,880
<font color=#FFFF00>You're home? Aren't these Ahjumeoni's shoes?</font>

490
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Take these and give it to her later.</font>

491
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,480
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

492
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, this is why I can't leave business to you.</font>

493
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go. To the heir's house. (reference to Lee Min Ho's drama, Heirs)</font>

494
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:59,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Unni! You left this at our place. These are shoes that you cherish.</font>

495
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my, this is what I was going to throw away.</font>

496
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,550
<font color=#FFFF00>But, I really need to use the bathroom.</font>

497
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,090
<font color=#FFFF00>My throat is a bit dry.</font>

498
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yes. Please come in.</font>

499
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, this place is so nice!</font>

500
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, it looks amazing.</font>

501
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,870
<font color=#FFFF00>But, is your son home?</font>

502
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. He went up to his closet for a little bit.</font>

503
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, is that so? Then that's good. We're already here,</font>

504
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,030
<font color=#FFFF00>so let's leave after we greet them.</font>

505
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:39,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Last time, I was going to say hello to your son at the funeral service.</font>

506
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost track of things and didn't even say hello.</font>

507
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, will you do so? Stay and have a cup of tea.</font>

508
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, Unni. Why are you being like this? I'll do it.</font>

509
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, the guest shouldn't do this. Sit.</font>

510
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked you to fix it last time!</font>

511
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,100
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're the one who didn't fix it for me! <br> - So I'm telling you to fix it yourself!</font>

512
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Goo Baek's Dad!</font>

513
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,260
<font color=#FFFF00>J Team?</font>

514
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I speak to you two?</font>

515
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

516
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to say to you two.</font>

517
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,340
<font color=#FFFF00>What do we do? I was uneasy.</font>

518
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know they would follow us to our home. But why did Cheong take those people into that room?</font>

519
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,280
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be fine.</font>

520
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Did the guests go somewhere?</font>

521
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Momentarily...</font>

522
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my. They are coming out of the room?</font>

523
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:53,960
<font color=#FFFF00>No, we were just looking at the room. This place is so nice.</font>

524
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my, is this your son?</font>

525
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, my son Heo Joon Jae is here.</font>

526
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,960
<font color=#FFFF00>This man is his friend.</font>

527
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,360
<font color=#FFFF00>And have you been introduced to Ms. Cheong?</font>

528
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we have. This young lady is so kind.</font>

529
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Your son is so handsome.</font>

530
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,120
<font color=#FFFF00>And,</font>

531
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,300
<font color=#FFFF00>But... I...</font>

532
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,130
<font color=#FFFF00>feel like I've seen you before.</font>

533
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Your faces feel very familiar.</font>

534
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:32,820
<font color=#FFFF00>We met before, right? Dubai?</font>

535
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,830
<font color=#FFFF00>We've never been to Dubai.</font>

536
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my! Right!</font>

537
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:44,570
<font color=#FFFF00>But why did the three lettered (in hangul) word Dubai appear in my head?</font>

538
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder why.</font>

539
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,180
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, that was quite out of the blue.</font>

540
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, it's so nice to meet you,</font>

541
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,250
<font color=#FFFF00>and let's meet each other often now.</font>

542
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Think carefully.</font>

543
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:14,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheong isn't made for mermaid shows! She erased her memory!</font>

544
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,160
<font color=#FFFF00>You erased my memories last time too! And that was why Joon Jae was acting like that after returning from Spain.</font>

545
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Just try saying this out loud somewhere.</font>

546
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:28,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheong, let's work together. If you can use this memory erasing skill well,</font>

547
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,950
<font color=#FFFF00>we're just applying Bill Gates. We just become worldwide millionaires.</font>

548
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:36,510
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine. I won't do those things that make you uselessly busy.</font>

549
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,110
<font color=#FFFF00>If I'm busy, I won't have time to see Heo Joon Jae.</font>

550
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,970
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

551
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheong, I'm saying this sincerely. If you break up with Joon Jae, you have to come to me.</font>

552
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I pulled number 2, okay?</font>

553
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,230
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this rascal saying?</font>

554
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, really. Cheong. I really, really like you. Why do you have so many things?</font>

555
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

556
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, don't do that.</font>

557
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,510
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just one time.<br>- Don't do it.</font>

558
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,900
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just one hug. <br>- Why are you hugging her?</font>

559
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheong. Wait.</font>

560
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, what are you doing?</font>

561
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,790
<font color=#FFFF00>This guy...</font>

562
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,230
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be insane.</font>

563
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,610
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter? Why? Cheong?</font>

564
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,550
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? Are you hurting somewhere?</font>

565
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, maybe you got discharged from the hospital too soon.</font>

566
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Does your heart hurt?</font>

567
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:41,850
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ The door to a new world is open. ♬</font>

568
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,200
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ It is within you. ♬</font>

569
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:56,340
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ When I enter my eyes are dazzled ♬</font>

570
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:02,430
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ A wide world ♬</font>

571
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:06,340
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ welcomes me. ♬</font>

572
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:12,590
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ I approach you. ♬</font>

573
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,560
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ I want to be embraced. ♬</font>

574
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,150
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ I want to stay in that world which is you ♬</font>

575
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did everyone go?</font>

576
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I sent them away.</font>

577
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

578
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I wanted to eat with you alone.</font>

579
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,980
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ I need you I love you ♬</font>

580
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,050
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ Eternally in your arms ♬</font>

581
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Since your condition isn't well, don't go anywhere. Let's have a party here by ourselves.</font>

582
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Go and change your clothes.</font>

583
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,940
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ Will you come to me and take my hand ♬</font>

584
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,930
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ Will you come to me and take my hand ♬</font>

585
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,090
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ I will love you ♬</font>

586
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,920
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ even if the world changes. ♬</font>

587
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:07,440
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ I owe you I miss you ♬<br>♬ I need you I love you ♬</font>

588
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,400
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ Eternally in your arms ♬</font>

589
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we have a drink?</font>

590
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,490
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

591
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:42,170
<font color=#FFFF00>If I drink, I think I'll ask you to stay.</font>

592
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,390
<font color=#FFFF00>If there's another way, tell me.</font>

593
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Please. Tell me there is one.</font>

594
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,970
<font color=#FFFF00>After your surgery, you barely eat.</font>

595
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:06,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't sleep and you hold in your pain.</font>

596
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:10,950
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I supposed to do? Do I have to...</font>

597
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:16,980
<font color=#FFFF00>just watch you... die?</font>

598
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,660
<font color=#FFFF00>If you return to the sea, will you be okay?</font>

599
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you be healthy?</font>

600
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Promise me one thing.</font>

601
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,220
<font color=#FFFF00>That as you are leaving, you won't erase my memories.</font>

602
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

603
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,290
<font color=#FFFF00>You were like that too.</font>

604
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:31,760
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you would rather love and be in pain than not remember and not be able to love.</font>

605
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:38,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Because there are memories to be cherished, I can send you away.</font>

606
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:46,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you become to pitiable. I could forever not come return.</font>

607
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you won't even know if I'm alive or dead,</font>

608
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,590
<font color=#FFFF00>you can only wait.</font>

609
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,340
<font color=#FFFF00>If you cannot come back forever, I'll be born again.</font>

610
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You do so as well.</font>

611
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:10,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. My love,</font>

612
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,150
<font color=#FFFF00>is longer than my time.</font>

613
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:20,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish you would become comfortable.</font>

614
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:26,540
<font color=#FFFF00>If we remember each other, we won't forget which road to return to.</font>

615
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:31,860
<font color=#FFFF00>So, we will meet again.</font>

616
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

617
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:49,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you choose. If you're going to erase, or leave.</font>

618
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I said you can choose.</font>

619
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I made my choice.</font>

620
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:39,590
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>Did I wake up from a long dream?</i>♬<br>♬ <i>As soon as I recognized you</i>♬</font>

621
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:43,920
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>My nameless love</i>♬</font>

625
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:05,950
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>always as brilliant?</i>♬</font>

626
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:14,650
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>If out of ten thousand chances our love came to be</i>♬</font>

627
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:22,720
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>If out of ten thousand chances you and I could begin</i>♬</font>
