<font color="yellow">Let go of me, you jerk.</font>

19
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:51,306
<font color="yellow">You seemed suspicious when you visited my vineyard.</font>

20
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,336
<font color="yellow">You two were having an affair since then, right?</font>

21
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,676

24
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,676
<font color="yellow">You deserve to be called a jerk.</font>

25
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:09,506

<font color="yellow">Please stop, Mother.</font>

27
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,276
<font color="yellow">How dare you stab me and Gi Pyo in the back...</font>

28
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:17,006
<font color="yellow">with such an innocent face?</font>

29

30
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:20,936
<font color="yellow">I don't understand...</font>

31
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:24,376
<font color="yellow">why you're treating Yun Shil this way.</font>

32

<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law is having an affair with another man.</font>

33
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,706
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't I say something to her?</font>

34
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:32,206
<font color="yellow">You should go to the jail.</font>

35
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:36,546

36
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,106
<font color="yellow">You're deluding yourself.</font>

37
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,546
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she my daughter-in-law?</font>

38
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,436
<font color="yellow">She had a wedding ceremony with my son.</font>

39
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:45,136
<font color="yellow">That wedding ceremony was not completed.</font>

40
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:47,036
<font color="yellow">Also, they are legally not married.</font>

41
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,436
<font color="yellow">Stop being unreasonable.</font>

42
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,106

00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,136
<font color="yellow">You're having an affair with my daughter-in-law.</font>

44
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:54,506
<font color="yellow">How dare you try to teach me?</font>

45
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,276
<font color="yellow">Please stop, Mother.</font>

46
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,806
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside and talk with me.</font>

47
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:01,106
<font color="yellow">You stay right there.</font>

48
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,706
<font color="yellow">You wait and see, you junk.</font>

49
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,606
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

50
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:15,276
<font color="yellow">Please go home before you face a rough ride.</font>

51
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:16,906
<font color="yellow">How can I leave you here and go home?</font>

52
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,936
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine. Although she talks like that,</font>

53
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:21,636
<font color="yellow">she's not really a bad person.</font>

54
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,206
<font color="yellow">I'll wait here, then.</font>

55
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,076
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be comfortable with that. Please go home.</font>

56
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:34,936
<font color="yellow">Then call me if something happens. I'll be here right away.</font>

57
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:37,206
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll call you later.</font>

58
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:07,136
<font color="yellow">The world is come to an end.</font>

59
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,236
<font color="yellow">How can you do this?</font>

60
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,776
<font color="yellow">Your husband is having a hard time in a cold prison cell.</font>

61
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:15,406
<font color="yellow">How can you, as his wife,</font>

62
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:19,106
<font color="yellow">have an affair with another man?</font>

63
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:21,576
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel pity for your husband?</font>

64
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,106
<font color="yellow">I was going to marry him...</font>

65
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,536
<font color="yellow">not because I loved him.</font>

66
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,706
<font color="yellow">- What? - Half of the reason was fear...</font>

67
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:31,276
<font color="yellow">and the rest was to repay the debt.</font>

68
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:32,846
<font color="yellow">And things brought me to this far.</font>

69
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:36,706
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to say this, but as you heard a while ago...</font>

70
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:39,436
<font color="yellow">I didn't complete the wedding with your son,</font>

71
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:41,506
<font color="yellow">and neither did I register the marriage.</font>

72
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,676
<font color="yellow">Please let me go now.</font>

73
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,936
<font color="yellow">Stop that nonsense!</font>

74
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:51,176
<font color="yellow">Mother, you're a woman, too. As a woman...</font>

75
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:54,106
<font color="yellow">please understand how I feel.</font>

76
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:55,576
<font color="yellow">Now I want to...</font>

77
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:58,036
<font color="yellow">set everything in order.</font>

78
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:00,736
<font color="yellow">Is Gi Pyo a baggage or a garbage to you?</font>

79
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,676
<font color="yellow">What do you want to clear up?</font>

80
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,776
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember what Gi Pyo has done to you and your dad?</font>

81
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:08,636
<font color="yellow">Are you going to discard him because you've got what you want?</font>

82
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:12,676
<font color="yellow">If hitting me can make your anger go away,</font>

83
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:14,846
<font color="yellow">hit me as much as you want to.</font>

84
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:20,736
<font color="yellow">You're so shameless.</font>

85
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:23,606
<font color="yellow">Are you the same Yun Shil that I know?</font>

86
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:40,776
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi brought me fish stew and it tastes amazing.</font>

87
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,076
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

88
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,536
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

89
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,676
<font color="yellow">Why don't you eat? Here.</font>

90
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:58,976
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

91
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:05,636
<font color="yellow">Why is life so hard, honey?</font>

92
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,806
<font color="yellow">Why? What happened?</font>

93
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,206
<font color="yellow">The oil store lady fled.</font>

94
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,236
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

95
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:15,906
<font color="yellow">You mean the store at the market?</font>

96
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:18,336
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she fled?</font>

97
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,906
<font color="yellow">- She ran away with my money. - What?</font>

98
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:24,936
<font color="yellow">Remember the money we lost because you stood surety for your friend?</font>

99
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,236
<font color="yellow">I was waiting to get my money to pay for it.</font>

100
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:31,006
<font color="yellow">Why is everything so messed up?</font>

101
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,076
<font color="yellow">That's why you looked so out of it.</font>

102
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:39,536
<font color="yellow">They say that you shouldn't trust anyone.</font>

103
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,236
<font color="yellow">How can she do this to me?</font>

104
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:44,376
<font color="yellow">I heard almost everyone at the market...</font>

105
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,836
<font color="yellow">got his or her money stolen by her.</font>

106
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:50,906
<font color="yellow">The entire market has been turned upside down.</font>

107
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,476
<font color="yellow">Gosh, they say you can never know what people are really thinking.</font>

108
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:54,936
<font color="yellow">How can she do that to us?</font>

109
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,476
<font color="yellow">What should we do, Honey?</font>

110
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:01,876
<font color="yellow">All we have is the rent deposit now.</font>

111
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:07,036
<font color="yellow">I mean, we're not young any more.</font>

112
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,106
<font color="yellow">We don't even own a house.</font>

113
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:12,136
<font color="yellow">What if we grow old like this?</font>

114
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:14,106
<font color="yellow">Let's be positive.</font>

115
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:17,036
<font color="yellow">It could have been worse.</font>

116
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,236
<font color="yellow">If we were still selling fried chicken at the market,</font>

117
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:23,506
<font color="yellow">she could have taken so much more than just that money.</font>

118
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:27,606
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

119
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,406
<font color="yellow">I really want to save money, but things keep happening.</font>

120
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:37,206
<font color="yellow">Things just keep on happening.</font>

121
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:40,306
<font color="yellow">When will we be able to save up enough money...</font>

122
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,936
<font color="yellow">to buy a house and a car?</font>

123
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:45,276
<font color="yellow">When will we be able to live like other people?</font>

124
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:47,936
<font color="yellow">We have to remember that both you and I have...</font>

125
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,336
<font color="yellow">never done any harm and have managed to be self-sufficient.</font>

126
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,076
<font color="yellow">We have no kids,</font>

127
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:56,806
<font color="yellow">but the two of us have been happy enough.</font>

128
00:07:57,136 --> 00:08:00,736
<font color="yellow">Also, I promise you that I'll focus and work very hard from now on.</font>

129
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,036
<font color="yellow">You sound mature for a change.</font>

130
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:04,336
<font color="yellow">And let's be honest.</font>

131
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,576
<font color="yellow">You at least have a handsome husband.</font>

132
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,036
<font color="yellow">On that note,</font>

133
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:12,736
<font color="yellow">shall we do homework after dinner?</font>

134
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,406
<font color="yellow">Deal.</font>

135
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:15,976
<font color="yellow">You naughty woman.</font>

136
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:18,836
<font color="yellow">All right, let's eat.</font>

137
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:20,436
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

138
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:22,976
<font color="yellow">Let's power up for homework.</font>

139
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,376
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

140
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:27,336
<font color="yellow">can we do homework first?</font>

141
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,176
<font color="yellow">I should have gotten numerous texts from her by now.</font>

142
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:41,276
<font color="yellow">It's weird that she's been quiet all day.</font>

143
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,636
<font color="yellow">Did she get sick from eating too many burgers?</font>

144
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,776
<font color="yellow">- Or... - Tae Yang, I'll be back tomorrow!</font>

145
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,606
<font color="yellow">Did her mum scold her harshly?</font>

146
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,206
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about you...</font>

147
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,406
<font color="yellow">because I saw you leaving like that earlier.</font>

148
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:12,306
<font color="yellow">Your mum didn't hit you, did she?</font>

149
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:16,076
<font color="yellow">Look at this kid.</font>

150
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,736
<font color="yellow">(Kang Tae Yang. Your mum didn't hit you, did she?)</font>

151
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:25,806
<font color="yellow">My mum...</font>

152
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:28,406
<font color="yellow">would never be violent with anyone.</font>

153
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,236
<font color="yellow">She's a wonderful person with a kind heart.</font>

154
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:34,636
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

155
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,446
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me.</font>

156
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,676
<font color="yellow">What do you think of my mum?</font>

157
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,176
<font color="yellow">This may sound discourteous,</font>

158
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:51,706
<font color="yellow">but I think she's very cute.</font>

159
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,536
<font color="yellow">Don't you think she looks scary and mean?</font>

160
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,946
<font color="yellow">She can be a little intimidating,</font>

161
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:06,406
<font color="yellow">but I think she's very cute and lovely.</font>

162
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,006
<font color="yellow">You're buttering her up to win her over, aren't you?</font>

163
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,776
<font color="yellow">I'm not good at flattery.</font>

164
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,776
<font color="yellow">You know what? I think you'd be so lovely...</font>

165
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:25,946
<font color="yellow">if you age like your mum.</font>

166
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,446
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I didn't know I was that lovely.</font>

167
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,736
<font color="yellow">You sound fine, so I'll get back to studying.</font>

168
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:47,476
<font color="yellow">Study hard.</font>

169
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:48,976
<font color="yellow">All the best!</font>

170
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,406
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

171
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,506
<font color="yellow">What am I doing right now?</font>

172
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:57,776
<font color="yellow">(Study hard. All the best!)</font>

173
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,976
<font color="yellow">Mum, why are you texting in the middle of dinner?</font>

174
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:03,506
<font color="yellow">- Who is it? - What?</font>

175
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:06,936
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

176
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:11,006
<font color="yellow">My friend who's been living abroad for a long time is in Korea now.</font>

177
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,936
<font color="yellow">I got a little chatty because I'm so happy that she's back.</font>

178
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,906
<font color="yellow">Mother, all the side dishes are so delicious.</font>

179
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,576
<font color="yellow">You must be an amazing cook.</font>

180
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:24,506
<font color="yellow">You saw my housekeeper making everything.</font>

181
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,136
<font color="yellow">Don't butter me up like that.</font>

182
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:30,176
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's not what she means.</font>

183
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,376
<font color="yellow">She's just being polite.</font>

184
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:37,006
<font color="yellow">I guess Hyo Won is staying out late today.</font>

185
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:39,306
<font color="yellow">It would have been good if she could eat with us.</font>

186
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,536
<font color="yellow">She's not out.</font>

187
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:42,736
<font color="yellow">She's locked up in her room.</font>

188
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:45,676
<font color="yellow">She's locked up?</font>

189
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,306
<font color="yellow">Are you saying she's confined?</font>

190
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,076
<font color="yellow">Although I'm very brave,</font>

191
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:13,936
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can jump from here.</font>

192
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:25,336
<font color="yellow">I miss Tae Yang.</font>

193
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:31,276
<font color="yellow">Mum took my phone. I don't have my laptop, either.</font>

194
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,636
<font color="yellow">I have no way of getting in touch with him.</font>

195
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:40,776
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

196
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,476
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

197
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,976
<font color="yellow">To be honest with you,</font>

198
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,536
<font color="yellow">I didn't like you from the first time.</font>

199
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,536
<font color="yellow">You're too tall...</font>

200
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,506
<font color="yellow">and skinny.</font>

201
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,406
<font color="yellow">You look miserable and unhappy.</font>

202
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,576
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stand you.</font>

203
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:04,376
<font color="yellow">But what can I do? Gi Pyo likes you.</font>

204
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:07,876
<font color="yellow">He kept saying that he has to marry you.</font>

205
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:12,006
<font color="yellow">No parents can win against their children, so I had to allow him.</font>

206
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,536
<font color="yellow">How dare you...</font>

207
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:19,206
<font color="yellow">cheat on my son?</font>

208
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:21,276
<font color="yellow">Please don't talk like that.</font>

209
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,306
<font color="yellow">I didn't cheat on him.</font>

210
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,706
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo and I aren't actually married.</font>

211
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,236
<font color="yellow">Shut it!</font>

212
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,476
<font color="yellow">You cheated on your husband.</font>

213
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:32,476
<font color="yellow">How can you have the audacity to talk back to me?</font>

214
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:34,406
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

215
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,136
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

216
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:40,876
<font color="yellow">I gave birth to Gi Pyo myself,</font>

217
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,706
<font color="yellow">but I sometimes wonder if he's really my son...</font>

218
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:46,776
<font color="yellow">because he can be very spiteful.</font>

219
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,276
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

220
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:52,936
<font color="yellow">When he's out of jail,</font>

221
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:56,636
<font color="yellow">who knows what he'll do to you for cheating on him?</font>

222
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,906
<font color="yellow">That's enough. Please stop.</font>

223
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:02,506
<font color="yellow">Listen. My son will kill you.</font>

224
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,506
<font color="yellow">You're so dead now.</font>

225
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,676
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm getting drunk.</font>

226
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,206
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me.</font>

227
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,736
<font color="yellow">I thought I should call you so that you won't worry.</font>

228
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:53,036
<font color="yellow">Thanks. How is she?</font>

229
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,176
<font color="yellow">She drank...</font>

230
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:56,106
<font color="yellow">and just fell asleep.</font>

231
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,876
<font color="yellow">- Was everything okay? - Of course.</font>

232
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:01,536
<font color="yellow">I'm still worried, though.</font>

233
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,806
<font color="yellow">- I'll come over now. - No, it's okay.</font>

234
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,706
<font color="yellow">It's getting late. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

235
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,706
<font color="yellow">I'm fine,</font>

236
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:11,906
<font color="yellow">- so you don't need to worry. - I have to see you...</font>

237
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:13,476
<font color="yellow">to stop worrying.</font>

238
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,606
<font color="yellow">I think she went to see Gi Pyo...</font>

239
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:17,436
<font color="yellow">and heard about it from him.</font>

240
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:19,306
<font color="yellow">She's angry,</font>

241
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:21,936
<font color="yellow">but I can understand her.</font>

242
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,736
<font color="yellow">All of this must be hard for you.</font>

243
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:26,336
<font color="yellow">It is,</font>

244
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,106
<font color="yellow">but it's better than my expectation.</font>

245
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,036
<font color="yellow">It's probably...</font>

246
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:36,176
<font color="yellow">because you're by my side.</font>

247
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,476
<font color="yellow">Thanks for saying that.</font>

248
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,606
<font color="yellow">And thanks a lot for mustering up your courage.</font>

249
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:43,076
<font color="yellow">I should be the one thanking you.</font>

250
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,736
<font color="yellow">Knowing how complicated...</font>

251
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:47,876
<font color="yellow">and tough the process would be,</font>

252
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,136
<font color="yellow">you still decided to love me.</font>

253
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,336
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

254
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,076
<font color="yellow">You had a long day.</font>

255
00:15:58,606 --> 00:15:59,636
<font color="yellow">You should go to bed early.</font>

256
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,406
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams.</font>

257
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:09,776
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

258
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,136
<font color="yellow">I want you to smile.</font>

259
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:15,606
<font color="yellow">When you worry too much,</font>

260
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,336
<font color="yellow">that makes me feel sorrier.</font>

261
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,436
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be sorry.</font>

262
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:28,636
<font color="yellow">We're walking together, heading toward the same direction.</font>

263
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:46,676
<font color="yellow">Did Sung Jun really say that to Mr Park?</font>

264
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:48,636
<font color="yellow">He did.</font>

265
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,476
<font color="yellow">"If you truly love someone,"</font>

266
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:52,776
<font color="yellow">"you must accept the person as they are."</font>

267
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,676
<font color="yellow">"Trashy landlords like you have no right..."</font>

268
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:57,376
<font color="yellow">"to love someone like Dong Sook, okay?"</font>

269
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,106
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

270
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,146
<font color="yellow">That touches my heart.</font>

271
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,836
<font color="yellow">I was touched myself, too.</font>

272
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:09,476
<font color="yellow">I guess Sung Jun really loves you, Mum.</font>

273
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,576
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Mum?</font>

274
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:20,436
<font color="yellow">Go to bed, Da Jeong. I'll be right back.</font>

275
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:35,406
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here in this cold weather, Dong Sook?</font>

276
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:42,336
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

277
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,906
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

278
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,146
<font color="yellow">Why don't you propose to me?</font>

279
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:52,236
<font color="yellow">- What? - You love me, don't you?</font>

280
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:56,976
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

281
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:01,736
<font color="yellow">love you.</font>

282
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:04,676
<font color="yellow">Then why don't you confess your love...</font>

283
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,706
<font color="yellow">and propose to me?</font>

284
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:11,776
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

285
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,806
<font color="yellow">I have nothing.</font>

286
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:18,146
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

287
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:21,276
<font color="yellow">If we are to get married and live with Da Jeong,</font>

288
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,576
<font color="yellow">we need to rent a two-bedroom house.</font>

289
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,176
<font color="yellow">We can live in my house.</font>

290
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:29,106
<font color="yellow">Da Jeong will have her room as she has now.</font>

291
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:32,336
<font color="yellow">I can be with you in your room.</font>

292
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:35,236
<font color="yellow">I don't have a regular income. What about our living expenses?</font>

293
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:36,536
<font color="yellow">I can make a living.</font>

294
00:18:37,646 --> 00:18:39,736
<font color="yellow">We won't live in luxury,</font>

295
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,146
<font color="yellow">but we won't go without food.</font>

296
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:45,836
<font color="yellow">I appreciate that, Dong Sook. But...</font>

297
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,876
<font color="yellow">even though I can't rent a splendid place...</font>

298
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,276
<font color="yellow">to nicely propose as others do,</font>

299
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,836
<font color="yellow">I should at least give you a decent ring.</font>

300
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,736
<font color="yellow">You do have many rings on your fingers.</font>

301
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:00,436
<font color="yellow">Just take one off and give it to me.</font>

302
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:15,376
<font color="yellow">Please put this ring on my finger yourself.</font>

303
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:17,836
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

304
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:37,976
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

305
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:41,646
<font color="yellow">kiss me.</font>

306
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,276
<font color="yellow">Kiss you?</font>

307
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,176
<font color="yellow">Shall I kiss you first?</font>

308
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:47,336
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

309
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:49,506
<font color="yellow">No, you should not.</font>

310
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:29,536
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

311
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:34,906
<font color="yellow">It was such a romantic and nice propose.</font>

312
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,576
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

313
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,176
<font color="yellow">Do you regret proposing me?</font>

314
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:49,146
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

315
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,606
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm moved.</font>

316
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:56,906
<font color="yellow">Why do you...</font>

317
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:00,276
<font color="yellow">love a man like me?</font>

318
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,806
<font color="yellow">I don't deserve you.</font>

319
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:10,776
<font color="yellow">I'm so thankful and happy that...</font>

320
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:16,236
<font color="yellow">I want to cry, Dong Sook.</font>

321
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,536
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking the initiative.</font>

322
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,276
<font color="yellow">I appreciate that you did as I asked you to.</font>

323
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:06,276
<font color="yellow">Please have some fruit, Mother.</font>

324
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,506
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

325
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,876
<font color="yellow">A stranger would think that you're my daughter-in-law.</font>

326
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,606
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you're overdoing it?</font>

327
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,376
<font color="yellow">I'm trying hard to win your favour.</font>

328
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,336
<font color="yellow">Don't you like it?</font>

329
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:28,536
<font color="yellow">It's not that I don't like it, but I feel awkward.</font>

330
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:30,276
<font color="yellow">It's just your second visit to my house,</font>

331
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:32,576
<font color="yellow">and you're acting like you've been living here for 20 years.</font>

332
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:34,676
<font color="yellow">It's actually somewhat creepy.</font>

333
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:37,606
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful next time, Mother.</font>

334
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,836
<font color="yellow">How can you say "Mother" so unreservedly?</font>

335
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:47,706
<font color="yellow">it's nice to see...</font>

336
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:49,236
<font color="yellow">two beauties here together.</font>

337
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:50,836
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the fruit.</font>

338
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:02,106
<font color="yellow">I think Mother doesn't like me.</font>

339
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:06,036
<font color="yellow">She doesn't easily become acquainted with people.</font>

340
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,176
<font color="yellow">But once she gets intimate,</font>

341
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:11,236
<font color="yellow">she's nice and kind.</font>

342
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,606
<font color="yellow">By the way, why is Hyo Won locked up in her room?</font>

343
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:17,276
<font color="yellow">Well... Wait a minute.</font>

344
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:22,536
<font color="yellow">I need to talk on the phone and check some documents. Wait here.</font>

345
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:24,606
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

346
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,606
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

347
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:36,576
<font color="yellow">Open the door. Open the door!</font>

348
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,076
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

349
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,836
<font color="yellow">- Who is it there? - It's Choi Ji Yun.</font>

350
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,776
<font color="yellow">Choi Ji Yun? A pooper?</font>

351
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:48,636
<font color="yellow">What is pooper doing here?</font>

352
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,406
<font color="yellow">I have the key with me.</font>

353
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,206
<font color="yellow">Shall I just go back?</font>

354
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:54,036
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

355
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,036
<font color="yellow">Please open the door.</font>

356
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,106
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you.</font>

357
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,136
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

358
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:11,236
<font color="yellow">How did you come here?</font>

359
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,806
<font color="yellow">I visited for dinner,</font>

360
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:16,036
<font color="yellow">and I came up here after hearing that you're locked up.</font>

361
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:18,006
<font color="yellow">I was worried about you, too.</font>

362
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,676
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

363
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:27,636
<font color="yellow">I'm dating someone recently,</font>

364
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:29,636
<font color="yellow">but Mum and my brother don't like him.</font>

365
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,736
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

366
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:35,306
<font color="yellow">Because he's poor and he isn't from a good family.</font>

367
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:38,006
<font color="yellow">Is that why you're locked up...</font>

368
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:39,506
<font color="yellow">so that you can't meet him?</font>

369
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:40,506
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

370
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,006
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

371
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,476
<font color="yellow">I know. I can't believe either.</font>

372
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,436
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed to say this...</font>

373
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:49,276
<font color="yellow">but Mum is so egoistic. She's a dictator.</font>

374
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,806
<font color="yellow">If you marry my brother, Mum will be hard on you.</font>

375
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:57,876
<font color="yellow">Would you agree if I marry your brother?</font>

376
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:02,076
<font color="yellow">I was always worried that you don't like me.</font>

377
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:05,376
<font color="yellow">As I'm in debt to you today, I won't disagree.</font>

378
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,236
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

379
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:10,836
<font color="yellow">Make sure to keep it a secret that I opened the door today.</font>

380
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:12,706
<font color="yellow">Sure. Don't worry about it.</font>

381
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,006
<font color="yellow">Are you going out to meet him?</font>

382
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:19,536
<font color="yellow">Mother will get furious if she knows.</font>

383
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:21,336
<font color="yellow">I'll just see him and come back right away.</font>

384
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:26,706
<font color="yellow">You are nice today.</font>

385
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:28,276
<font color="yellow">Let's get along well from now on.</font>

386
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:52,276
<font color="yellow">Just see him and come back soon, all right?</font>

387
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:55,376
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone that I opened the door.</font>

388
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:57,306
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

389
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,506
<font color="yellow">Things are getting better than I expected.</font>

390
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,536
<font color="yellow">One obstacle removed.</font>

391
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,636
<font color="yellow">I should go home now.</font>

392
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,676
<font color="yellow">Really? I'll take you home.</font>

393
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,736
<font color="yellow">Mum! Ji Yun is leaving.</font>

394
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:28,506
<font color="yellow">Okay. I can't leave my room now as I took the shower just now.</font>

395
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:31,036
<font color="yellow">- Get home safely. - Thank you, Mother.</font>

396
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:32,676
<font color="yellow">I'm come by again soon.</font>

397
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:36,206
<font color="yellow">No one welcomes you here.</font>

398
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,436
<font color="yellow">I think he sort of looks...</font>

399
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,876
<font color="yellow">like the English teacher whom I had a crush on in school.</font>

400
00:26:44,106 --> 00:26:46,706
<font color="yellow">In terms of looks, he is exactly my type.</font>

401
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:01,006
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

402
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:10,076
<font color="yellow">Darling!</font>

403
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:16,576
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

404
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,676
<font color="yellow">I came to see you because I missed you so much.</font>

405
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,636
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm hearing your voice,</font>

406
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:22,836
<font color="yellow">I finally feel like I can breathe.</font>

407
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:36,936
<font color="yellow">Didn't you have dinner yet?</font>

408
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:41,236
<font color="yellow">- I didn't even have lunch. - Why?</font>

409
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:43,706
<font color="yellow">It's a long story.</font>

410
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:45,906
<font color="yellow">Get me...</font>

411
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:47,636
<font color="yellow">something to eat first,</font>

412
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,076
<font color="yellow">my darling.</font>

413
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:14,406
<font color="yellow">You look like you have been starving all day.</font>

414
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,836
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly.</font>

415
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:18,836
<font color="yellow">I haven't had any food since eating the burgers in the morning.</font>

416
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:20,206
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something happen?</font>

417
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:21,876
<font color="yellow">Actually, my mum...</font>

418
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,876
<font color="yellow">No one is home.</font>

419
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,706
<font color="yellow">Is everyone away or something?</font>

420
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,476
<font color="yellow">My mum is abroad on a trip,</font>

421
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:30,636
<font color="yellow">and my brother is away for work.</font>

422
00:28:31,006 --> 00:28:33,536
<font color="yellow">Our housekeeper is visiting her family in the countryside.</font>

423
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:34,906
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

424
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,506
<font color="yellow">So I am...</font>

425
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,806
<font color="yellow">going to sleep at hostel today.</font>

426
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:43,236
<font color="yellow">- At hostel? - I told you.</font>

427
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,736
<font color="yellow">I already paid for three months up front.</font>

428
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:49,736
<font color="yellow">Still, you have a home...</font>

429
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:52,176
<font color="yellow">It's way too scary to be alone at home.</font>

430
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,606
<font color="yellow">What if a burglar breaks in?</font>

431
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,806
<font color="yellow">It's safe there.</font>

432
00:28:58,976 --> 00:29:01,676
<font color="yellow">Well, that is true.</font>

433
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,276
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad that I have rented a room there as my second home.</font>

434
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,136
<font color="yellow">It was such a clever thing to do.</font>

435
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:09,606
<font color="yellow">I have such wise foresight.</font>

436
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:18,636
<font color="yellow">Wait, hold on.</font>

437
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,706
<font color="yellow">Guys are not allowed in here.</font>

438
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:27,036
<font color="yellow">Don't be so square.</font>

439
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:29,776
<font color="yellow">The manager will turn a blind eye because we're best friends now.</font>

440
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,376
<font color="yellow">When did you two become best friends?</font>

441
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:37,006
<font color="yellow">We've gotten close since the orange juice incident.</font>

442
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:40,976
<font color="yellow">What do you think of my room?</font>

443
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,106
<font color="yellow">Isn't it so cute?</font>

444
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,236
<font color="yellow">I've lived here for a long time,</font>

445
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:55,776
<font color="yellow">but I've never seen a decorated room like this.</font>

446
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:57,776
<font color="yellow">It suits you.</font>

447
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,836
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the compliment.</font>

448
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,676
<font color="yellow">Have a good night, then.</font>

449
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,206
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

450
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:09,906
<font color="yellow">I've never slept away from home before.</font>

451
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:13,006
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep.</font>

452
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:14,976
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

453
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:16,806
<font color="yellow">Put me...</font>

454
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,076
<font color="yellow">to sleep before you go.</font>

455
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:23,736
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? I'm not done talking.</font>

456
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:27,676
<font color="yellow">I don't want to fall for your tricks again.</font>

457
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,676
<font color="yellow">It's simple, so you don't need to worry.</font>

458
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:30,776
<font color="yellow">It's simple?</font>

459
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:32,636
<font color="yellow">Sing a lullaby for me.</font>

460
00:30:33,636 --> 00:30:34,676
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

461
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:40,036
<font color="yellow">I really don't think I can fall asleep alone.</font>

462
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,236
<font color="yellow">I've never slept away from home before,</font>

463
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:45,776
<font color="yellow">so I'm a little nervous.</font>

464
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:49,806
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to sleep if I miss the time I usually fall asleep.</font>

465
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:52,376
<font color="yellow">I'll end up staying up all night.</font>

466
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,306
<font color="yellow">If I can't fall asleep, I might go to your room...</font>

467
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:00,806
<font color="yellow">and bug you all night long.</font>

468
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:02,406
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

469
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,206
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

470
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:07,806
<font color="yellow">sing a lullaby for me, okay?</font>

471
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,806
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be able to sleep very well.</font>

472
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:13,536
<font color="yellow">Goodness, that's such a weird favour to ask.</font>

473
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:15,736
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

474
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,076
<font color="yellow">I'll sing it just once, okay?</font>

475
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,776
<font color="yellow">I'm so sleepy right now.</font>

476
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,606
<font color="yellow">I'll probably fall asleep before you even finish singing.</font>

477
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,476
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes.</font>

478
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:45,236
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams, my baby</font>

479
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:52,536
<font color="yellow">In the garden and on the hills</font>

480
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:59,776
<font color="yellow">The birds and lambkins</font>

481
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:05,936
<font color="yellow">Are all asleep, too</font>

482
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:12,176
<font color="yellow">The moon is guarding you</font>

483
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:19,106
<font color="yellow">It's sending silver and golden bells</font>

484
00:32:20,476 --> 00:32:25,736
<font color="yellow">Your way tonight</font>

485
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:32,236
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams, my baby</font>

486
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:42,936
<font color="yellow">Are you asleep, Hyo Won?</font>

487
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:14,636
<font color="yellow">What did I just do?</font>

488
00:33:26,576 --> 00:33:27,606
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

489
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:57,506
<font color="yellow">You might think of me as a dead person because I'm in here,</font>

490
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:00,206
<font color="yellow">but I have nothing else to lose.</font>

491
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,736
<font color="yellow">That means I have nothing to fear...</font>

492
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,736
<font color="yellow">and nothing to hold me back. Do you understand?</font>

493
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,436
<font color="yellow">You should be in bed. Why are you drinking at this late hour?</font>

494
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:16,606
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

495
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,736
<font color="yellow">- So I wanted to have a glass. - Why can't you sleep?</font>

496
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:21,306
<font color="yellow">- Is something bothering you? - No.</font>

497
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,306
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm not sleepy now.</font>

498
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,736
<font color="yellow">You should meet a nice girl soon.</font>

499
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:28,906
<font color="yellow">I want you to have cute children and live happily with your family.</font>

500
00:34:29,106 --> 00:34:31,506
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum. I feel like I let you down.</font>

501
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:33,276
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

502
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:37,506
<font color="yellow">I'm so proud of you, and I rely on you a lot.</font>

503
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:39,706
<font color="yellow">You didn't let me down at all.</font>

504
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,136
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - What is it?</font>

505
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:45,476
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell me?</font>

506
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,776
<font color="yellow">No. I just want to wish you a good night.</font>

507
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,476
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

508
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,476
<font color="yellow">We should find a nice girl for him as soon as possible.</font>

509
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:01,076
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

510
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:02,806
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about Dong Jin.</font>

511
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:06,306
<font color="yellow">He's drinking alone in the kitchen.</font>

512
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,046
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin is drinking alone? - Yes.</font>

513
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:15,336
<font color="yellow">He's trying not to show it because he doesn't want to worry us,</font>

514
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:19,176
<font color="yellow">but he must be so lonely to be single at that age.</font>

515
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,436
<font color="yellow">When will I be able to stop worrying about my children?</font>

516
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:25,436
<font color="yellow">I must say,</font>

517
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,476
<font color="yellow">it's much better than making our children...</font>

518
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:30,276
<font color="yellow">worry about us.</font>

519
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:34,206
<font color="yellow">Parents who are able to worry about their children are lucky.</font>

520
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,176
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

521
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:37,546
<font color="yellow">But still...</font>

522
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:40,736
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard to find a woman as wonderful as his ex-wife.</font>

523
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,776
<font color="yellow">It's all over. There's no point in talking about it now.</font>

524
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:44,236
<font color="yellow">It's pointless.</font>

525
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,836
<font color="yellow">It just came out because I'm upset.</font>

526
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:16,836
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, taking a photo of this?</font>

527
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:32,976
<font color="yellow">I just found the happiness. I can't give it up.</font>

528
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,276
<font color="yellow">I will focus on myself.</font>

529
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:39,306
<font color="yellow">It's okay to do that now.</font>

530
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:03,906
<font color="yellow">Why did you gather us so early in the morning?</font>

531
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:05,546
<font color="yellow">Say what you need to.</font>

532
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:07,336
<font color="yellow">I was cooking breakfast.</font>

533
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:09,136
<font color="yellow">What is it, Dong Sook?</font>

534
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:18,076
<font color="yellow">I want to get married.</font>

535
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,336
<font color="yellow">- Get married? - Get married?</font>

536
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:23,136
<font color="yellow">- With whom? - With whom?</font>

537
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:35,106
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you want to marry him?</font>

538
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,376
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum. I want your permission.</font>

539
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:47,136
<font color="yellow">Don't accept the bow.</font>

540
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,876
<font color="yellow">I know I have many shortcomings...</font>

541
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,506
<font color="yellow">and that you don't approve of me.</font>

542
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:05,806
<font color="yellow">That's why I considered moving away for Dong Sook's sake,</font>

543
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:08,336
<font color="yellow">but I decided love can overcome it all.</font>

544
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:12,206
<font color="yellow">Allow me to marry Dong Sook, Father, Mother.</font>

545
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:15,476
<font color="yellow">Please. Sung Jun and I are meant to be.</font>

546
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:18,476
<font color="yellow">You are not. Don't say such nonsense.</font>

547
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:20,236
<font color="yellow">I'll never ever allow you as her husband.</font>

548
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:21,836
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

549
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,976
<font color="yellow">Of all the men in the world...</font>

550
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:26,376
<font color="yellow">you chose one who can't even support himself.</font>

551
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:33,136
<font color="yellow">You got divorced twice. Are you aiming for a third time?</font>

552
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,006
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

553
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:36,836
<font color="yellow">I have nothing more to hear.</font>

554
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:39,046
<font color="yellow">Da Jeong, help me up, will you?</font>

555
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:41,076
<font color="yellow">- Sure, Grandma. - My legs went weak.</font>

556
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:43,176
<font color="yellow">- Get up slowly. - My goodness.</font>

557
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:54,836
<font color="yellow">Dad, you might not know,</font>

558
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:58,336
<font color="yellow">but Sung Jun won Best the Newcomer at a year-end award ceremony.</font>

559
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,706
<font color="yellow">At the 2000 KBC Gayo Festival.</font>

560
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,836
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

561
00:39:02,546 --> 00:39:03,576
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

562
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:07,276
<font color="yellow">I'm not as close-minded as you may think.</font>

563
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:12,976
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you give your approval, Mr Lee?</font>

564
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,636
<font color="yellow">There's no reason to refuse them if they love each other.</font>

565
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:18,706
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - However...</font>

566
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,136
<font color="yellow">I can't let you get married...</font>

567
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:23,336
<font color="yellow">just because I approve when my wife doesn't.</font>

568
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,136
<font color="yellow">You two need to work together...</font>

569
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,336
<font color="yellow">and convince her.</font>

570
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:31,076
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dad.</font>

571
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,006
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir. I mean Father.</font>

572
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:46,736
<font color="yellow">Is that a new ring?</font>

573
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,736
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

574
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:52,376
<font color="yellow">Sung Jun put it on my finger last night when he proposed.</font>

575
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:54,136
<font color="yellow">It's one of his.</font>

576
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:56,676
<font color="yellow">The proposal was a bit hurried.</font>

577
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:58,636
<font color="yellow">I did with one of my rings.</font>

578
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:01,106
<font color="yellow">How could you be so inconsiderate?</font>

579
00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:05,006
<font color="yellow">How dare you propose to my sister without even getting her a ring?</font>

580
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,306
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, are you happy being treated like that?</font>

581
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,636
<font color="yellow">I told him to give me one of his rings.</font>

582
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,406
<font color="yellow">Why should we waste our hard-earned money?</font>

583
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:14,636
<font color="yellow">We don't have much.</font>

584
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:16,876
<font color="yellow">I'll earn a fortune and within two years...</font>

585
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,376
<font color="yellow">I'll buy her a ring with a diamond the size of a teardrop.</font>

586
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:22,006
<font color="yellow">You're all talk.</font>

587
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:23,706
<font color="yellow">Dear brother-in-law.</font>

588
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:25,736
<font color="yellow">I'm not your brother-in-law, okay?</font>

589
00:40:26,236 --> 00:40:27,906
<font color="yellow">Ddong Jin.</font>

590
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,906
<font color="yellow">I believe you're in no position to threaten me.</font>

591
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:34,406
<font color="yellow">I'm actually thinking of...</font>

592
00:40:34,406 --> 00:40:36,806
<font color="yellow">barging into that room to tell your mum everything.</font>

593
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:38,336
<font color="yellow">- Like what? - Like what?</font>

594
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:44,736
<font color="yellow">Now that I thought about it, proposing with your own ring...</font>

595
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:47,336
<font color="yellow">could actually be quite meaningful.</font>

596
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:50,076
<font color="yellow">Right? I'm glad you get it.</font>

597
00:40:53,706 --> 00:40:56,076
<font color="yellow">I have to go and get ready for work.</font>

598
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:05,176
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin gave in easier than I expected.</font>

599
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:07,606
<font color="yellow">I know. I expected him to throw a tantrum.</font>

600
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:10,136
<font color="yellow">Men have a way of communicating.</font>

601
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,006
<font color="yellow">Now we just have to persuade your mum.</font>

602
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:16,976
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Leather Jacket.</font>

603
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:21,806
<font color="yellow">Everything's going smoothly since I'm wearing a suit you made.</font>

604
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:24,106
<font color="yellow">I feel good about this.</font>

605
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:30,136
<font color="yellow">Are you happy? Your wish came true.</font>

606
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,236
<font color="yellow">That's what.</font>

607
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:33,546
<font color="yellow">It's her third time.</font>

608
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,606
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. - My bad.</font>

609
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:54,976
<font color="yellow">Why are you waiting out here in the cold?</font>

610
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:56,106
<font color="yellow">You should have texted me.</font>

611
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:58,606
<font color="yellow">I just got here. How about her?</font>

612
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:01,936
<font color="yellow">She drank a lot last night and is still asleep.</font>

613
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,076
<font color="yellow">I made some soup and set the table for her.</font>

614
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:07,336
<font color="yellow">Did you have a hard time?</font>

615
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:09,906
<font color="yellow">I'm not alone any more.</font>

616
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:12,306
<font color="yellow">It was hard, but bearable.</font>

617
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:16,876
<font color="yellow">Based on her reaction last night, I don't think she'll just go back.</font>

618
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:22,576
<font color="yellow">She might do something unexpected, so let's brace ourselves.</font>

619
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:24,136
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

620
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:28,876
<font color="yellow">I today will be long and tough.</font>

621
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:31,836
<font color="yellow">Let's take a long roundabout route so we can...</font>

622
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:34,576
<font color="yellow">walk in the morning sun and recharge ourselves.</font>

623
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:37,476
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

624
00:42:55,336 --> 00:42:57,406
<font color="yellow">By the way, how is your cold?</font>

625
00:42:57,406 --> 00:42:58,876
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

626
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,476
<font color="yellow">Good. I was worried.</font>

627
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:04,176
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, but I was worried...</font>

628
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:07,376
<font color="yellow">you'd end up getting sick because of me.</font>

629
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:11,546
<font color="yellow">I told you that I have a hardy immune system.</font>

630
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,606
<font color="yellow">That sounds like you want me to kiss you again.</font>

631
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:20,106
<font color="yellow">Shall we? To kill time?</font>

632
00:43:20,276 --> 00:43:22,576
<font color="yellow">Stop it. You're being gross.</font>

633
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:24,436
<font color="yellow">You managed fine last night. Come here.</font>

634
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,336
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing me or I'll never kiss you again.</font>

635
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:29,806
<font color="yellow">What? I can't let that happen. Fine, no kissing.</font>

636
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,076
<font color="yellow">My hand is getting sweaty. Wait.</font>

637
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:42,306
<font color="yellow">What if someone saw that?</font>

638
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:44,306
<font color="yellow">Who cares? We aren't strangers.</font>

639
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:45,906
<font color="yellow">We're a couple in love.</font>

640
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,706
<font color="yellow">Why do you hesitate when you always do in the end?</font>

641
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,206
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

642
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:12,336
<font color="yellow">Your kiss chased all the blues away.</font>

643
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,006
<font color="yellow">Were you very upset last night?</font>

644
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:19,606
<font color="yellow">Because of what Gi Pyo's mum said?</font>

645
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:22,906
<font color="yellow">It would be a lie to say I wasn't,</font>

646
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:26,306
<font color="yellow">but don't worry about it. We expected something like this.</font>

647
00:44:27,336 --> 00:44:29,606
<font color="yellow">I wondered if it's right for me...</font>

648
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:32,236
<font color="yellow">to keep you close...</font>

649
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,176
<font color="yellow">at the expense of you being insulted.</font>

650
00:44:38,006 --> 00:44:41,506
<font color="yellow">But I decided to focus on myself from now on.</font>

651
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:45,806
<font color="yellow">I'd feel terribly down if we break up...</font>

652
00:44:46,836 --> 00:44:48,906
<font color="yellow">and I'm happy when we're together.</font>

653
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,336
<font color="yellow">So I won't think about anything else.</font>

654
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:53,736
<font color="yellow">That's the best thing I've heard from you.</font>

655
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:58,136
<font color="yellow">Putting yourself first is the best thing...</font>

656
00:44:58,336 --> 00:44:59,906
<font color="yellow">you can do for me.</font>

657
00:45:00,036 --> 00:45:02,076
<font color="yellow">Do you get what I mean?</font>

658
00:45:04,176 --> 00:45:07,006
<font color="yellow">You became so brave in just one night.</font>

659
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:08,836
<font color="yellow">My lips have amazing powers.</font>

660
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,876
<font color="yellow">What? Why do you always end up talking about lips?</font>

661
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,176
<font color="yellow">Lips? Shall we kiss while we're on the topic?</font>

662
00:45:14,406 --> 00:45:16,906
<font color="yellow">Stop being silly. Let's go.</font>

663
00:45:35,706 --> 00:45:37,636
<font color="yellow">Out of all these lottery tickets...</font>

664
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:40,906
<font color="yellow">only three were the winners worth five dollars each.</font>

665
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,636
<font color="yellow">I was never one to be lucky.</font>

666
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:51,076
<font color="yellow">What was the pig dream about, then?</font>

667
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:54,306
<font color="yellow">My neck is so stiff.</font>

668
00:45:55,306 --> 00:45:57,136
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I need a massage.</font>

669
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:06,406
<font color="yellow">What did Ms Choi say?</font>

670
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:08,906
<font color="yellow">I kneeled down for three straight hours...</font>

671
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:10,136
<font color="yellow">and she didn't even flinch.</font>

672
00:46:11,476 --> 00:46:12,476
<font color="yellow">My legs hurt.</font>

673
00:46:14,476 --> 00:46:16,136
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

674
00:46:18,606 --> 00:46:19,776
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

675
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:25,736
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, you have therapeutic hands.</font>

676
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:28,336
<font color="yellow">Your touch made the numbness go away.</font>

677
00:46:28,336 --> 00:46:30,506
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious? - Yes.</font>

678
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:33,836
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook, you are the pharmacy of my life.</font>

679
00:46:36,776 --> 00:46:38,806
<font color="yellow">How did you keep your feelings for so long?</font>

680
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:41,376
<font color="yellow">I'll leave you two alone.</font>

681
00:46:41,576 --> 00:46:42,736
<font color="yellow">I'll go to work.</font>

682
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,236
<font color="yellow">Bye, Seon Nyeo.</font>

683
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,606
<font color="yellow">Can you clean up for me?</font>

684
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:48,706
<font color="yellow">- You got nothing? - Nothing.</font>

685
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:52,676
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

686
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,476
<font color="yellow">What if your mother never approves?</font>

687
00:46:58,006 --> 00:46:59,606
<font color="yellow">She'll change her mind after a few days.</font>

688
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:01,806
<font color="yellow">She was against my first...</font>

689
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,606
<font color="yellow">and second marriage at first,</font>

690
00:47:03,936 --> 00:47:06,776
<font color="yellow">but in the end she went, "I don't care any more. Suit yourselves."</font>

691
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:08,076
<font color="yellow">That's what she said.</font>

692
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:13,936
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I shouldn't have said that.</font>

693
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,676
<font color="yellow">After all, this is your first time.</font>

694
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:18,636
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

695
00:47:20,176 --> 00:47:22,636
<font color="yellow">I'm very experienced in this.</font>

696
00:47:22,776 --> 00:47:24,076
<font color="yellow">Leave everything to me.</font>

697
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,476
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

698
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:28,906
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

699
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:39,636
<font color="yellow">(Oh Young Eun Bakery)</font>

700
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:41,406
<font color="yellow">Oh Young Eun Bakery?</font>

701
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:44,106
<font color="yellow">Is that a new bakery?</font>

702
00:47:46,536 --> 00:47:49,206
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be, "Young Eun"?</font>

703
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:57,306
<font color="yellow">My mum's name is Oh Young Eun.</font>

704
00:47:59,506 --> 00:48:01,276
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

705
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,806
<font color="yellow">Your mum's name is Oh Young Eun?</font>

706
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:07,776
<font color="yellow">- How old are you? - I'm five.</font>

707
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:09,736
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

708
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:12,336
<font color="yellow">My mum's baking is amazing.</font>

709
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,906
<font color="yellow">- Pay us a visit, okay? - Okay.</font>

710
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:21,936
<font color="yellow">What a bright little boy.</font>

711
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:26,906
<font color="yellow">I wish I had a son like that.</font>

712
00:48:31,006 --> 00:48:32,036
<font color="yellow">A year-end get-together?</font>

713
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:34,036
<font color="yellow">Time does fly.</font>

714
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,106
<font color="yellow">I've lost track of time with so many things going on.</font>

715
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:38,306
<font color="yellow">I am busy,</font>

716
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:40,236
<font color="yellow">but I'll try to make time.</font>

717
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:43,076
<font color="yellow">After all, we're alumni of the same orphanage.</font>

718
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:44,336
<font color="yellow">Young Eun is coming, too.</font>

719
00:48:45,176 --> 00:48:46,806
<font color="yellow">Who? Young Eun?</font>

720
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:48,206
<font color="yellow">- Oh Young Eun? - Yes.</font>

721
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:51,076
<font color="yellow">She's been living in Seattle until she came back a few months ago.</font>

722
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:52,306
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

723
00:48:52,706 --> 00:48:54,036
<font color="yellow">Young Eun is in Korea?</font>

724
00:48:54,206 --> 00:48:55,306
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'm home.</font>

725
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:58,106
<font color="yellow">Right. Okay.</font>

726
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,706
<font color="yellow">I'll be there no matter what.</font>

727
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:02,306
<font color="yellow">I'll see you then. Okay.</font>

728
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:04,736
<font color="yellow">- What was that about? - What?</font>

729
00:49:04,906 --> 00:49:07,036
<font color="yellow">There's a year-end get-together for my orphanage.</font>

730
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:08,036
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

731
00:49:08,136 --> 00:49:09,976
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is everyone?</font>

732
00:49:10,106 --> 00:49:11,406
<font color="yellow">They went to have lunch,</font>

733
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,876
<font color="yellow">but my stomach wasn't feeling very well.</font>

734
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:14,936
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here? - What do you mean?</font>

735
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,576
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be working at the fried-chicken place?</font>

736
00:49:17,406 --> 00:49:19,236
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear me.</font>

737
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,036
<font color="yellow">I was lost in my thoughts and ended up coming here.</font>

738
00:49:21,036 --> 00:49:24,936
<font color="yellow">Get it together, woman.</font>

739
00:49:24,936 --> 00:49:26,176
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

740
00:49:26,806 --> 00:49:29,776
<font color="yellow">I'm not myself any more after losing that money.</font>

741
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:31,136
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil?</font>

742
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,936
<font color="yellow">Where are you, Yun Shil?</font>

743
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:37,536
<font color="yellow">What brings you here, Ma'am?</font>

744
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:40,536
<font color="yellow">- Who's that? - What?</font>

745
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:43,976
<font color="yellow">That's the person who almost became Yun Shil's mother-in-law.</font>

746
00:49:44,036 --> 00:49:45,036
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

747
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:50,406
<font color="yellow">Why would I be here except to see Yun Shil?</font>

748
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:53,606
<font color="yellow">- Where is she, by the way? - She's on lunch break.</font>

749
00:49:55,476 --> 00:49:56,836
<font color="yellow">There they are.</font>

750
00:50:00,536 --> 00:50:02,836
<font color="yellow">You little scoundrel.</font>

751
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:04,806
<font color="yellow">How dare you seduce...</font>

752
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,236
<font color="yellow">my daughter-in-law?</font>

753
00:50:07,406 --> 00:50:08,536
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

754
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:09,976
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

755
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:12,036
<font color="yellow">You brought pain to my son.</font>

756
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,076
<font color="yellow">I won't let you go until you get what you deserve.</font>

757
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:16,806
<font color="yellow">You promised you wouldn't be like this. Please stop.</font>

758
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:18,076
<font color="yellow">Let go of him.</font>

759
00:50:18,106 --> 00:50:19,276
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

760
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:21,336
<font color="yellow">taking his side in front of your mother-in-law?</font>

761
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:22,806
<font color="yellow">- Let go. - Gosh.</font>

762
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:24,476
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

763
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:26,236
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

764
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:28,736
<font color="yellow">I'll call the police if you keep this up.</font>

765
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:31,776
<font color="yellow">Police, my foot.</font>

766
00:50:31,776 --> 00:50:33,736
<font color="yellow">Okay. Call them.</font>
