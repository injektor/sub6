00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:11,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Lee, your retirement
ceremony today was so glorious.</font>

2
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:14,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I shed tears since it was so touching.</font>

3
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:19,011
<font color=#FFFF00>All the suits Mr Lee has made...</font>

4
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,411
<font color=#FFFF00>for 50 years were there to see.</font>

5
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,751
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right, Mother. Our
customers gathered in suits...</font>

6
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:25,851
<font color=#FFFF00>that were popular over time.</font>

7
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:28,352
<font color=#FFFF00>It felt like I was watching a fashion show.</font>

8
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:30,812
<font color=#FFFF00>It must have been amazing.</font>

9
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish I were there to see it if
only I haven't had work today.</font>

10
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you go there, Grandma?</font>

11
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,611
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't go there since I didn't
want to spoil the mood...</font>

12
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,582
<font color=#FFFF00>by crying on such a good occasion.</font>

13
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:43,482
<font color=#FFFF00>You deserved it.</font>

14
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,551
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you feel?</font>

15
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:48,752
<font color=#FFFF00>My sight is better maybe
because I feel good.</font>

16
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, Yun Shil,</font>

17
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,752
<font color=#FFFF00>you went through a lot of trouble.</font>

18
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:56,651
<font color=#FFFF00>It was nothing.</font>

19
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:58,111
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean it was nothing?</font>

20
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,751
<font color=#FFFF00>You planned the retirement ceremony
and prepared food all by yourself.</font>

21
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:05,412
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a dullard to brag
about your wife all the time.</font>

22
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,651
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not bragging.</font>

23
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just stating the fact.</font>

24
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:11,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I stop?</font>

25
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:13,621
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stop now. That's what she says.</font>

26
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:15,812
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness.
- He obeys his wife so well.</font>

27
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:21,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been a tailor for all of my life.</font>

28
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:25,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I was a diligent tailor to my customers.</font>

29
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:28,312
<font color=#FFFF00>However, I was lazy...</font>

30
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:32,682
<font color=#FFFF00>taking care of only one person, Gok Ji.</font>

31
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,511
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a saying that the beacon
does not shine on its own base.</font>

32
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:40,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought she would always be there for me.</font>

33
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I've delayed viewing flowers,</font>

34
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:47,752
<font color=#FFFF00>viewing autumn colours and snow
for next year all the time.</font>

35
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:51,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I kept saying "next year".</font>

36
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:54,311
<font color=#FFFF00>And then here I am now.</font>

37
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:59,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided to spend the
last days of my life...</font>

38
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:03,652
<font color=#FFFF00>entirely for your mum.</font>

39
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:10,022
<font color=#FFFF00>However, I'm worried that your
mum might have a hard time...</font>

40
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:14,522
<font color=#FFFF00>taking care of my eyes,
opposite to what I wanted.</font>

41
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:17,752
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how I feel now.</font>

42
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,681
<font color=#FFFF00>The suits were your priority all along,</font>

43
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,612
<font color=#FFFF00>and now I am number one to you.</font>

44
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:26,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sorry about that.</font>

45
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,552
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad that I am treated well.</font>

46
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's another dullard, I may say.</font>

47
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,082
<font color=#FFFF00>He's right.</font>

48
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:40,081
<font color=#FFFF00>To keep the good mood,</font>

49
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:43,651
<font color=#FFFF00>let's hear a song from Father!</font>

50
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,652
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- What did he say?</font>

51
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,352
<font color=#FFFF00>- A song?
- Right.</font>

52
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:53,382
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I should sing
a song on such a good day.</font>

53
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:01,552
<font color=#FFFF00>I give this song...</font>

54
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:05,312
<font color=#FFFF00>to my love, Gok Ji.</font>

55
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:09,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Besame</font>

56
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Besame Mucho</font>

57
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:18,582
<font color=#FFFF00>On a silent night when the
Lila flowers were falling</font>

58
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:23,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Besame Besame Mucho</font>

59
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:29,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Send me the scent of Lila flowers</font>

60
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:31,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Besame Mucho</font>

61
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:36,382
<font color=#FFFF00>A pretty young lady like a Lila flower</font>

62
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Besame Mucho</font>

63
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:44,252
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a lonely Santa Maria</font>

64
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:50,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Besame Besame Mucho</font>

65
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:56,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Send me the scent of Lila flowers</font>

66
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,252
<font color=#FFFF00>- Encore!
- Encore!</font>

67
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:15,851
<font color=#FFFF00>The person you're calling is not answering.</font>

68
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave a message after the beep.</font>

69
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone is ignoring my calls as if
they've signed a pact or something.</font>

70
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:21,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

71
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:29,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you found a place to move yet?</font>

72
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:32,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you see that I'm calling
everyone I know to borrow money?</font>

73
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you even asking?
To make my blood boil?</font>

74
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:36,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you taking it out on me?</font>

75
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,852
<font color=#FFFF00>How much do you need?</font>

76
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,158
<font color=#FFFF00>- Shall I lend you some money?
- You're so heartless.</font>

77
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,551
<font color=#FFFF00>How many flats do you own...</font>

78
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,381
<font color=#FFFF00>in Gangnam and Gangbuk?</font>

79
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:48,481
<font color=#FFFF00>You can obviously see that your
brother and I are going crazy...</font>

80
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:51,052
<font color=#FFFF00>because we're about to be out
on the street. And what?</font>

81
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:54,012
<font color=#FFFF00>"How much do you need? Shall
I lend you some money?"</font>

82
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:58,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you expecting me to rent one
of the flats out to you for free?</font>

83
00:04:58,552 --> 00:04:59,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm a beggar?</font>

84
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:02,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to say no even if you offer.</font>

85
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:04,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want your flat!</font>

86
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are the two of you being like this?
Please calm down.</font>

87
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:12,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to think about it if you
implored me. I shouldn't bother.</font>

88
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,821
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you pouring oil on the flames now?</font>

89
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:16,821
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you loving the fact that
I'm completely broke now?</font>

90
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,082
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough, Mother.</font>

91
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:20,181
<font color=#FFFF00>You're being childish.</font>

92
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Childish?</font>

93
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Whose side are you on?</font>

94
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:28,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Be honest with me.</font>

95
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:31,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you on my side or on Hyo Joo's side?</font>

96
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:35,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Talking about things like that
won't help us in any way.</font>

97
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:38,612
<font color=#FFFF00>You should try to get on Hyo Joo's
good side to get a place to live.</font>

98
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing good will come out of
losing your temper like that.</font>

99
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have no pride or what?</font>

100
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,462
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should pride even
matter in this situation?</font>

101
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:48,511
<font color=#FFFF00>You frustrate me so much.</font>

102
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:49,951
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

103
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:51,112
<font color=#FFFF00>That must be Hyo Sang.</font>

104
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:59,382
<font color=#FFFF00>"You frustrate me so much"?</font>

105
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:02,712
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she talk like that
to her mother-in-law?</font>

106
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:06,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, my pride has been shattered.</font>

107
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,252
<font color=#FFFF00>People are so ungenerous and ungiving.</font>

108
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:14,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the one who helped them
get to where they are now.</font>

109
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:18,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Even my relatives are avoiding my calls.</font>

110
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,382
<font color=#FFFF00>We were too naive.</font>

111
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

112
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:24,582
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a stable job.</font>

113
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you take out a loan?</font>

114
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I already told you.</font>

115
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:30,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I already borrowed the
maximum amount allowed...</font>

116
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,981
<font color=#FFFF00>because you asked me for
money as a wedding gift.</font>

117
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:34,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

118
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,612
<font color=#FFFF00>People will think that I asked
you for a huge fortune.</font>

119
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,612
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, I'm so upset.</font>

120
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm tired. I'm going to get some rest.</font>

121
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:53,081
<font color=#FFFF00>- She's acting strange.
- In what way?</font>

122
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Ever since we went bankrupt,</font>

123
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:57,182
<font color=#FFFF00>she's been rude to me. She
talks back to me, too.</font>

124
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,282
<font color=#FFFF00>She's gotten so cheeky.</font>

125
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:02,712
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a sensitive person.</font>

126
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Try to be more understanding.</font>

127
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,712
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness...</font>

128
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

129
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:19,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, it's so cold.</font>

130
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,482
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've waited inside.</font>

131
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm all right. But I need you...</font>

132
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,851
<font color=#FFFF00>- to go somewhere with me.
- Where?</font>

133
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:29,882
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll find out.</font>

134
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:49,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that guy...</font>

135
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:52,052
<font color=#FFFF00>It's you.</font>

136
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I shot that commercial a little while ago.</font>

137
00:07:58,782 --> 00:07:59,981
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know it'd be out already.</font>

138
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:01,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell me?</font>

139
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:03,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Handling everything alone
must've been stressful.</font>

140
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:06,382
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been stressed out
with your family matters.</font>

141
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, I should've been on set
to take care of things for you.</font>

142
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,752
<font color=#FFFF00>You look even more dashing in it.</font>

143
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:24,852
<font color=#FFFF00>What if you really become
globally famous...</font>

144
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,382
<font color=#FFFF00>like my mum said?</font>

145
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Fame doesn't come that easy.</font>

146
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I shot it thinking it'd be...</font>

147
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,082
<font color=#FFFF00>my last commercial because I'd
be assigned to a school soon.</font>

148
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:38,882
<font color=#FFFF00>It's already over.</font>

149
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, you're so awesome.</font>

150
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,282
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

151
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,872
<font color=#FFFF00>A long-term lease agreement for this house.</font>

152
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,422
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been having such a hard time...</font>

153
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:19,682
<font color=#FFFF00>trying to find a place to live.</font>

154
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:23,151
<font color=#FFFF00>I signed a long-term lease for
this house with the money...</font>

155
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I earned with the commercial.</font>

156
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:27,782
<font color=#FFFF00>- Tae Yang.
- It's small and shabby,</font>

157
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,452
<font color=#FFFF00>but it can be a shelter for
your family for the time being.</font>

158
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,152
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

159
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:35,482
<font color=#FFFF00>That's crazy. I can't accept this.</font>

160
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,582
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's the matter?
- You even lent me money.</font>

161
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to be more indebted to you.</font>

162
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:45,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want you to feel indebted.</font>

163
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Put yourself in my shoes. If I'm in a bind,</font>

164
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,282
<font color=#FFFF00>will you turn a blind eye?</font>

165
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that you won't.</font>

166
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,181
<font color=#FFFF00>The same goes for me.</font>

167
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,981
<font color=#FFFF00>- But still...
- Also, if we break the lease,</font>

168
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,462
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to get the deposit back.
That will be a waste.</font>

169
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:05,352
<font color=#FFFF00>The lease is for two years.</font>

170
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:07,752
<font color=#FFFF00>If your family moves out because
the situation improves,</font>

171
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:09,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I can take over the lease.</font>

172
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:12,012
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to feel indebted.</font>

173
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:18,152
<font color=#FFFF00>It took me a whole week to find this house.</font>

174
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Please accept my sincere gesture...</font>

175
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:22,552
<font color=#FFFF00>and live here with your mum.</font>

176
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:28,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy and grateful to be
able to do something for you,</font>

177
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,552
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't take my happiness away from me.</font>

178
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:33,922
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang.</font>

179
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't tell your mum that I got this lease.</font>

180
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried it might
make her uncomfortable.</font>

181
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:44,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm grateful...</font>

182
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,312
<font color=#FFFF00>and sorry.</font>

183
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:51,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I do need to wait until I
get assigned to a school,</font>

184
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,512
<font color=#FFFF00>but I passed the exam,</font>

185
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,252
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't worry about me.</font>

186
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,692
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to establish my career
as soon as possible...</font>

187
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,282
<font color=#FFFF00>so that I can take great care of you.</font>

188
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,882
<font color=#FFFF00>How did I meet such a
wonderful guy like you?</font>

189
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I must've saved the world at
least 10 times in my past life.</font>

190
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I must've saved the
world at least 100 times.</font>

191
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,752
<font color=#FFFF00>You even have a way with words.</font>

192
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,512
<font color=#FFFF00>You're honestly so sweet.</font>

193
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:33,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks...</font>

194
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:34,912
<font color=#FFFF00>for accepting it.</font>

195
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I should thank you.</font>

196
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:41,392
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be grateful for the rest of my life.</font>

197
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:04,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Lee's retirement ceremony
made me think of this.</font>

198
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:05,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd also love to have...</font>

199
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:10,011
<font color=#FFFF00>a retirement ceremony when I'm
older and wiser in about 30 years.</font>

200
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Thinking about it got me emotional.</font>

201
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:12,752
<font color=#FFFF00>I hear you.</font>

202
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:15,582
<font color=#FFFF00>When I first heard that Mr Lee
wants to move to Gangneung,</font>

203
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:17,642
<font color=#FFFF00>my heart ached so much as
if it's been punctured.</font>

204
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:19,182
<font color=#FFFF00>But then I thought about it...</font>

205
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:23,182
<font color=#FFFF00>and realised that he'll
really enjoy his time there.</font>

206
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:24,612
<font color=#FFFF00>He will.</font>

207
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Couples must have...</font>

208
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,512
<font color=#FFFF00>each other's backs especially
when they're older.</font>

209
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's try to be more caring
toward each other...</font>

210
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,252
<font color=#FFFF00>and love each other more
passionately, okay?</font>

211
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,752
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

212
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:37,282
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

213
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:40,612
<font color=#FFFF00>isn't today that day?</font>

214
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,252
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you.</font>

215
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:47,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I gave up on having a baby. I
won't stress you out about it.</font>

216
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,562
<font color=#FFFF00>They say that age is nothing but a number.</font>

217
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:53,881
<font color=#FFFF00>That's so not true.</font>

218
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Every year, I feel the difference.</font>

219
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:59,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Our batteries have been depleted.</font>

220
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Both of us...</font>

221
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,582
<font color=#FFFF00>are still too young to feel depleted.</font>

222
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,082
<font color=#FFFF00>My battery is still at its fullest.</font>

223
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, whatever.</font>

224
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Move over. Gosh.</font>

225
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to bed already?</font>

226
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:15,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm tired.</font>

227
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:16,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, where's the blanket?</font>

228
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you tired, Honey?</font>

229
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:23,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Go away. Stop coming on to me.</font>

230
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, seriously.</font>

231
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo, please.</font>

232
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,382
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so nice to lie down next to you.</font>

233
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,852
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sun Nyeo...
- I'm exhausted.</font>

234
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not even in the mood for it.</font>

235
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,651
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

236
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,182
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't understand romance.</font>

237
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Romance doesn't give you food.</font>

238
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's give up on having a baby
because it just won't happen.</font>

239
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:45,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to focus on
preparing for retirement.</font>

240
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,152
<font color=#FFFF00>If I try a little harder,</font>

241
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:50,081
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be awarded for my
performance in this quarter.</font>

242
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:53,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, stop going on about it.</font>

243
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:55,082
<font color=#FFFF00>The prize is 40g of gold.</font>

244
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:58,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure I get it
no matter what happens.</font>

245
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:02,782
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a gold-grubber.</font>

246
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,412
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you think that 40g of gold...</font>

247
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,412
<font color=#FFFF00>is more important than your husband?
I'm speechless.</font>

248
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I want that 40g of gold.</font>

249
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:20,151
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so exhausted.</font>

250
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,352
<font color=#FFFF00>It was a long day, wasn't it?</font>

251
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:24,451
<font color=#FFFF00>It was pretty hectic,</font>

252
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:27,182
<font color=#FFFF00>but it felt rewarding and I'm
proud of myself. It feels good.</font>

253
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,082
<font color=#FFFF00>You did really well today.</font>

254
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:31,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Come sit here.</font>

255
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you worked so hard today,</font>

256
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:42,281
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you a foot massage.</font>

257
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,012
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to.</font>

258
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:48,112
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't resist when I
offer something like this.</font>

259
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:55,452
<font color=#FFFF00>How does it feel getting a foot
massage from your husband?</font>

260
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:59,181
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels so refreshing.</font>

261
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:02,381
<font color=#FFFF00>It does, doesn't it? You'll feel
even more refreshed in the morning.</font>

262
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,552
<font color=#FFFF00>You can count on it.</font>

263
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm all done.</font>

264
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,511
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you, Yun Shil.
- For what?</font>

265
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:17,112
<font color=#FFFF00>For doing so much for my
dad's retirement ceremony.</font>

266
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:21,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you, Dad's
last day as a tailor...</font>

267
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:22,952
<font color=#FFFF00>will be more memorable.</font>

268
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:27,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if I can be even half
as good as he was as a tailor.</font>

269
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:29,552
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have a long way to go.</font>

270
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Once we get the time,</font>

271
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,982
<font color=#FFFF00>let's put our heads
together and think about...</font>

272
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,582
<font color=#FFFF00>how you can become a better tailor.</font>

273
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,252
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's this?
- It's Yun Shil's diary.</font>

274
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,881
<font color=#FFFF00>When I moved into this house,</font>

275
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:02,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil was in such a hurry to
leave that she left this behind.</font>

276
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:05,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I was curious so I read
through a few pages.</font>

277
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:10,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm giving you this because I thought
this might help you move on.</font>

278
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,888
<font color=#FFFF00>I barely escaped and ran away to Seoul.</font>

279
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:34,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a stranger here and I
have no one to rely on.</font>

280
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:37,352
<font color=#FFFF00>But knowing that he's not here,</font>

281
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:39,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I can finally breathe now.</font>

282
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:42,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I've come this far,</font>

283
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,652
<font color=#FFFF00>but what if he finds me?</font>

284
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:49,382
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm scared he might find me again.</font>

285
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:53,512
<font color=#FFFF00>He ended up finding where I was.</font>

286
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,612
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how far I run away...</font>

287
00:16:56,282 --> 00:17:00,612
<font color=#FFFF00>or work to pay back the money
I owe, it's was no use.</font>

288
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:06,012
<font color=#FFFF00>If I could, I would give him my kidney...</font>

289
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:08,752
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to end this ill-fated
relationship with Gi Pyo.</font>

290
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:11,982
<font color=#FFFF00>But there's nothing I can do.</font>

291
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so suffocated.</font>

292
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:16,858
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop trying to run away!</font>

293
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Tomorrow is the day I marry Gi Pyo.</font>

294
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:22,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I've come this far for I
have nowhere to run away to.</font>

295
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:25,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I've tried telling myself to
marry him out of gratitude.</font>

296
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:29,181
<font color=#FFFF00>But I can't help feeling
like I'm entering a dark...</font>

297
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,882
<font color=#FFFF00>prison where there's no
exit nor a beam of hope.</font>

298
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Will I be able to do this?</font>

299
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm scared and I feel hopeless.</font>

300
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:54,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo. You're my son,</font>

301
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:58,482
<font color=#FFFF00>but you should have at least a
little bit of conscious in you.</font>

302
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:02,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Since she was in the peak of her youth...</font>

303
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,381
<font color=#FFFF00>up until now, you kept her
by your side with that lie.</font>

304
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:08,282
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not too late now to let her
go and live her life in happiness.</font>

305
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,352
<font color=#FFFF00>You've tortured her enough.</font>

306
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:18,682
<font color=#FFFF00>So wish her happiness with a good heart.</font>

307
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:22,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come back to Anseong with me.</font>

308
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:26,622
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll have to pay for your
sins if you go on like this.</font>

309
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you crying?</font>

310
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,251
<font color=#FFFF00>Why shed tears so early in the morning?</font>

311
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:05,511
<font color=#FFFF00>To think that you and Father won't
be sitting here at the table...</font>

312
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:09,282
<font color=#FFFF00>with us from tonight, makes me cry.</font>

313
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,621
<font color=#FFFF00>If Mother and Father leave,</font>

314
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:15,751
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be so sad and things won't
be the same around here.</font>

315
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:17,252
<font color=#FFFF00>If your mother-in-law isn't here,</font>

316
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:20,651
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll be happy there's no
one here to nag at you.</font>

317
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:24,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say such a thing. I've
never thought like that.</font>

318
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,552
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just kidding. It's a joke.</font>

319
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:27,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh dear.</font>

320
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,622
<font color=#FFFF00>If I'm not here, you're
the lady of the house.</font>

321
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,082
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't be so weak hearted.</font>

322
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. Why is Yun Shil crying?</font>

323
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,412
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a secret between us two.</font>

324
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:48,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying now.</font>

325
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:53,281
<font color=#FFFF00>In order to give birth to a
child, you must have larger hips.</font>

326
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,282
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you expect to have
a child with those hips?</font>

327
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,122
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. You're embarrassing me.</font>

328
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:09,282
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me see.
- What?</font>

329
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,181
<font color=#FFFF00>In order to have at least three children,</font>

330
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:14,451
<font color=#FFFF00>your hips should be this
large, don't you think?</font>

331
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:16,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it. That's absurd.</font>

332
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:28,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take good care of the family.</font>

333
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:33,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about us here.
Just enjoy your newlywed life.</font>

334
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:37,881
<font color=#FFFF00>If there's anything you'd like
to eat or you need, let me know.</font>

335
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,981
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll deliver it to you
as fast as lightening.</font>

336
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Next year,</font>

337
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:45,382
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm hoping you'll have a baby in your arms.</font>

338
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:50,282
<font color=#FFFF00>We've agreed not to get too
stressed out about that.</font>

339
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,282
<font color=#FFFF00>It's our turn next.</font>

340
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Please accept our bows.</font>

341
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:08,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take good care of Da Jeong
as if she were your own daughter.</font>

342
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:11,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, Father. Please don't worry.</font>

343
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:14,411
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure to visit
you often on my days off.</font>

344
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:18,351
<font color=#FFFF00>If you come too often, you'll be
interfering our newlywed life.</font>

345
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:20,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Once a month will be enough.</font>

346
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:22,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Grandfather.</font>

347
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:25,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung's new song
ranked 12th on the chart.</font>

348
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:28,981
<font color=#FFFF00>We only have his success
to look forward to now.</font>

349
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:31,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about us now. Just
focus on enjoying your lives.</font>

350
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,712
<font color=#FFFF00>If the song ranked 12th,</font>

351
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:36,351
<font color=#FFFF00>and if you move up one each month,</font>

352
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:38,621
<font color=#FFFF00>by the time we move back, you'll
be on the top of the chart.</font>

353
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:40,122
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, Mum.</font>

354
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure no one can think the way you do.</font>

355
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether you choose to remain
at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop...</font>

356
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:05,852
<font color=#FFFF00>or decide to return to Meesa Apparel,</font>

357
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I leave that to you to decide.</font>

358
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:10,982
<font color=#FFFF00>We have Sam Do and Ms Geum
to run Wolgyesu Tailor Shop,</font>

359
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:14,252
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't worry and discuss
things with Yun Shil.</font>

360
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:18,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you'll make a wise decision.</font>

361
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:20,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I will, Dad.</font>

362
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:22,312
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the lady of the house from now on.</font>

363
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Do your best managing the household...</font>

364
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:26,481
<font color=#FFFF00>and take good care of the family.</font>

365
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:27,658
<font color=#FFFF00>I will, Mother.</font>

366
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:29,681
<font color=#FFFF00>I think that will be
enough for our farewells.</font>

367
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't we all go to the front
yard and take a family picture?</font>

368
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,552
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's do that.
- That sounds good.</font>

369
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:37,252
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks perfect.</font>

370
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:39,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone's in perfect position.</font>

371
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Sam Do. Stand closer to Sun Nyeo.</font>

372
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,182
<font color=#FFFF00>There you go. That's perfect.</font>

373
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,558
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin and Yun Shil. You
two seem stuck together.</font>

374
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,882
<font color=#FFFF00>You two are too close. Move away a bit.</font>

375
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:53,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see now. Mother and Father.</font>

376
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,682
<font color=#FFFF00>It will look nice if you hold hands.</font>

377
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:00,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, now. I know you're newlyweds,</font>

378
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,452
<font color=#FFFF00>but if you could restrain yourselves
a little, I'd appreciate it.</font>

379
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,982
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you told me to hold
her hands with both my hands.</font>

380
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:13,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone seems to be in position
and you all look very nice.</font>

381
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:15,511
<font color=#FFFF00>This is looking good.</font>

382
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,681
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone say, "Kimchi".</font>

383
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:19,311
<font color=#FFFF00>- Kimchi.
- Kimchi.</font>

384
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:20,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Say, "Cheese".</font>

385
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,512
<font color=#FFFF00>- Cheese.
- Cheese.</font>

386
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone say, "Wolgyesu".</font>

387
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:30,152
<font color=#FFFF00>- Wolgyesu.
- Wolgyesu.</font>

388
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:48,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I never imagined we'd be
thrown out of this house.</font>

389
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:56,012
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. This can't be happening.</font>

390
00:23:56,982 --> 00:24:00,812
<font color=#FFFF00>How did I end up like this?</font>

391
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:05,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I've always been able to
live off my tactfulness.</font>

392
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:11,482
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I have shot myself in the foot?</font>

393
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:13,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Mum.</font>

394
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:16,352
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough now. Our
cab is waiting outside.</font>

395
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care, Madam Ko.</font>

396
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for everything.</font>

397
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:32,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's this month's salary...</font>

398
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:34,681
<font color=#FFFF00>and some consolatory payment.</font>

399
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,912
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to give
me consolatory payment.</font>

400
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:44,882
<font color=#FFFF00>We should evacuate before
the new owner comes.</font>

401
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Haven't you finished packing?</font>

402
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have much to pack. You can leave.</font>

403
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:53,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye, Stepmother.</font>

404
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:58,912
<font color=#FFFF00>So, are you going to
Cheongdam-dong or Seongbuk-dong?</font>

405
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:01,652
<font color=#FFFF00>- I haven't decided yet.
- Anyway,</font>

406
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:05,182
<font color=#FFFF00>whether you go to Cheongdam-dong
or Seongbuk-dong,</font>

407
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:09,012
<font color=#FFFF00>take good care of yourself
and keep in touch.</font>

408
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:11,252
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

409
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:13,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye, Hyo Won.</font>

410
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you didn't like me,</font>

411
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,612
<font color=#FFFF00>but I liked you a lot.</font>

412
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel sorrier about parting with you...</font>

413
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:28,912
<font color=#FFFF00>without getting more closer,</font>

414
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,282
<font color=#FFFF00>than leaving this house.</font>

415
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,432
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't hold any grudges against you.</font>

416
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:37,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you wouldn't need it,</font>

417
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:41,312
<font color=#FFFF00>but let me know if you
need my help at any time.</font>

418
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:43,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be there for you right away.</font>

419
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:45,412
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

420
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:51,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye, Ji Yun.</font>

421
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:55,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I think our cab is here.</font>

422
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:57,512
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

423
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:03,812
<font color=#FFFF00>We're leaving. Take care.</font>

424
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't drink too much.</font>

425
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Take...</font>

426
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:12,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye.</font>

427
00:26:27,182 --> 00:26:28,852
<font color=#FFFF00>You should start packing...</font>

428
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:31,482
<font color=#FFFF00>before the new owner comes.</font>

429
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,582
<font color=#FFFF00>- Remove all the distraint tags.
- What?</font>

430
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:37,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the new owner of this house.</font>

431
00:26:38,412 --> 00:26:40,252
<font color=#FFFF00>- I won the auction.
- What?</font>

432
00:26:40,912 --> 00:26:41,952
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

433
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:45,882
<font color=#FFFF00>- Then why...
- This house was my late mum's,</font>

434
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:47,382
<font color=#FFFF00>and mine.</font>

435
00:26:48,312 --> 00:26:50,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't have any other way
to get rid of lodgers.</font>

436
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:52,452
<font color=#FFFF00>You can stay.</font>

437
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:59,452
<font color=#FFFF00>She's so scary.</font>

438
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:04,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch your step.</font>

439
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:08,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful.</font>

440
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you standing still?</font>

441
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>You can leave.</font>

442
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,651
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be staying at a
friend's house for a while.</font>

443
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:27,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Yun!</font>

444
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it mean...</font>

445
00:27:29,312 --> 00:27:32,112
<font color=#FFFF00>that you'll separate with Hyo Sang?</font>

446
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:34,252
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a separation.</font>

447
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,181
<font color=#FFFF00>I need some time to think.</font>

448
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:39,082
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you need to think about?</font>

449
00:27:39,412 --> 00:27:40,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to think about
breaking up with Hyo Sang...</font>

450
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:42,752
<font color=#FFFF00>now that we're broke?</font>

451
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,152
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like that.</font>

452
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:47,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been stressed out
and troubled these days.</font>

453
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:51,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to straighten up my thoughts alone.</font>

454
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:54,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you holding a candle to the sun?</font>

455
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:58,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you're more
stressed out than Hyo Sang?</font>

456
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you more troubled than Hyo Sang?</font>

457
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,752
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't console and encourage...</font>

458
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:05,182
<font color=#FFFF00>your husband in trouble.</font>

459
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:06,811
<font color=#FFFF00>You think of running away.</font>

460
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,552
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not running away.</font>

461
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:11,811
<font color=#FFFF00>I need some time to accept this situation.</font>

462
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:13,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you yelling at me now?</font>

463
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:15,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Mum.</font>

464
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,412
<font color=#FFFF00>She can think that way in her position.</font>

465
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:21,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Hyo Sang know about this?</font>

466
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:24,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I talked to him on the phone just now.</font>

467
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:29,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go, Mum.</font>

468
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:31,252
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't live like that.</font>

469
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it, Mum.</font>

470
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Come back after you take some rest.</font>

471
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:49,882
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll text you the new address.</font>

472
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Hyo Won.</font>

473
00:28:57,582 --> 00:28:58,652
<font color=#FFFF00>You!</font>

474
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:01,181
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've married Hyo Sang for money.</font>

475
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:03,382
<font color=#FFFF00>If not, you can't do this.</font>

476
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:05,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

477
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

478
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,252
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is this?</font>

479
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:20,952
<font color=#FFFF00>What shall I do now?</font>

480
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:46,412
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems to be...</font>

481
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin's neighborhood.</font>

482
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, it happened to be near his house.</font>

483
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:56,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like it, Mum?</font>

484
00:29:57,182 --> 00:30:00,912
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

485
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:08,752
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen to me?</font>

486
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,982
<font color=#FFFF00>My late mum said,</font>

487
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:16,312
<font color=#FFFF00>you can deceive a tiger
approaching from the back,</font>

488
00:30:16,852 --> 00:30:19,451
<font color=#FFFF00>but you can't deceive your destiny
approaching from the front.</font>

489
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,511
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

490
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:25,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Even a tiger wouldn't want my destiny.</font>

491
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:28,743
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter with you, Mum?
People might see. It's embarrassing.</font>

492
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:31,081
<font color=#FFFF00>There was such a lot of fortune.</font>

493
00:30:31,082 --> 00:30:33,551
<font color=#FFFF00>Neither have I spent it
nor even touched it.</font>

494
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:36,252
<font color=#FFFF00>What a state I am in!</font>

495
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,551
<font color=#FFFF00>How could my destiny...</font>

496
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:41,682
<font color=#FFFF00>turn out this way?</font>

497
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:45,312
<font color=#FFFF00>What should Hyo Sang and I do
if you keep acting like this?</font>

498
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,151
<font color=#FFFF00>You should muster up your courage.</font>

499
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:49,312
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I have courage in this situation?</font>

500
00:30:50,012 --> 00:30:54,052
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a good thing that I
don't dive into Han River.</font>

501
00:30:57,252 --> 00:30:59,312
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Cry as much as you want.</font>

502
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:05,052
<font color=#FFFF00>You can cry if that makes you feel better.</font>

503
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:07,012
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right, Mum.</font>

504
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:12,882
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here.</font>

505
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:16,282
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here, Mother.</font>

506
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,512
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here, Tae Yang?</font>

507
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, Tae Yang...</font>

508
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:26,952
<font color=#FFFF00>and I looked for a place to live.</font>

509
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,412
<font color=#FFFF00>We looked hard to find this place.</font>

510
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:32,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I came first and looked around the house.</font>

511
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:35,473
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, it's very warm inside since
the house gets a lot of sunlight.</font>

512
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get inside, Mum.</font>

513
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:42,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't walk.</font>

514
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:46,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like being dragged
to a slaughterhouse.</font>

515
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:47,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it a slaughterhouse?</font>

516
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:51,082
<font color=#FFFF00>The four of us will live
happily in this house.</font>

517
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:53,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't walk.</font>

518
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:54,412
<font color=#FFFF00>It's cold, Mum.</font>

519
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go inside.</font>

520
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:11,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Ride on my back, Mother.</font>

521
00:32:11,552 --> 00:32:12,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

522
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,282
<font color=#FFFF00>- Watch out for your head.
- Be careful.</font>

523
00:32:22,152 --> 00:32:23,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

524
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful.</font>

525
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:35,711
<font color=#FFFF00>It's cozy.</font>

526
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:38,481
<font color=#FFFF00>I cleaned up and wiped
the floor this morning.</font>

527
00:32:38,482 --> 00:32:39,851
<font color=#FFFF00>You can unpack.</font>

528
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:40,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like it, Mum?</font>

529
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:43,352
<font color=#FFFF00>All four of us...</font>

530
00:32:43,852 --> 00:32:45,311
<font color=#FFFF00>have to live in here?</font>

531
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,082
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I share a room,</font>

532
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:49,482
<font color=#FFFF00>and Hyo Sang and Ji Yun
can stay in another room.</font>

533
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:04,482
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

534
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:12,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that all?</font>

535
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,151
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I add two rooms, a
bathroom and a living room,</font>

536
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,251
<font color=#FFFF00>it's smaller than the living
room at our former house.</font>

537
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:20,882
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the use of having
a big and empty house?</font>

538
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,682
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a house for four of us,</font>

539
00:33:22,782 --> 00:33:24,182
<font color=#FFFF00>and it's just right for us.</font>

540
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,912
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong, Mother? Are you all right?</font>

541
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:31,952
<font color=#FFFF00>This house is so small...</font>

542
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:34,852
<font color=#FFFF00>that I feel it lacks oxygen.</font>

543
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:38,382
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't breathe.
- Mum, you're overreacting.</font>

544
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,252
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nonsense.</font>

545
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:42,552
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm serious.</font>

546
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't breathe.</font>

547
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:49,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, follow what I do.</font>

548
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:50,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Inhale...</font>

549
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:53,512
<font color=#FFFF00>and exhale.</font>

550
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,882
<font color=#FFFF00>You're really something, aren't you?</font>

551
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I wondered...</font>

552
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,052
<font color=#FFFF00>who on earth won my house at the auction.</font>

553
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:16,982
<font color=#FFFF00>It was you!</font>

554
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:18,682
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

555
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:22,552
<font color=#FFFF00>you put on a show because you wanted...</font>

556
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:25,181
<font color=#FFFF00>to kick me, Hyo Won and
Mum out of this house.</font>

557
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,662
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my house where I used to
live with my deceased mother.</font>

558
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:30,852
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the ones who barged
in and took over the house.</font>

559
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:32,312
<font color=#FFFF00>So?</font>

560
00:34:32,812 --> 00:34:36,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you been sharpening your blade
for revenge for the last 20 years...</font>

561
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,412
<font color=#FFFF00>so that you can slash us off in one blow?</font>

562
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:41,751
<font color=#FFFF00>You kicked my family out of the house...</font>

563
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:43,712
<font color=#FFFF00>and ousted me from the company.</font>

564
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Was this your plan from the get-go?</font>

565
00:34:45,712 --> 00:34:49,281
<font color=#FFFF00>None of this would've happened if
you and your mum hadn't acted up.</font>

566
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:52,311
<font color=#FFFF00>If you let Dong Jin become the CEO,</font>

567
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:54,352
<font color=#FFFF00>you wouldn't be in this mess now.</font>

568
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me make it clear to you once again.</font>

569
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:02,481
<font color=#FFFF00>I absolutely cannot give the
CEO position to Dong Jin.</font>

570
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:04,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, Hyo Won and I risked...</font>

571
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:06,551
<font color=#FFFF00>everything we own to protect
our control over the company.</font>

572
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:10,522
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll utilise every legal rule
that exists to keep our control.</font>

573
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:13,851
<font color=#FFFF00>The board already made the decision.</font>

574
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:16,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't complicate things. Just
take your hands off the company.</font>

575
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:19,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Joo, please come to your senses.</font>

576
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin is happy with
that employee of his,</font>

577
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,411
<font color=#FFFF00>and they have even registered
themselves as married.</font>

578
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:27,521
<font color=#FFFF00>You're wasting your time and energy
if you're doing all of this for him!</font>

579
00:35:27,522 --> 00:35:28,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut it.</font>

580
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:31,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to do everything
in my power to make sure...</font>

581
00:35:31,812 --> 00:35:33,281
<font color=#FFFF00>he returns to where he should be.</font>

582
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:37,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I will not let him take
the CEO position from me.</font>

583
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:39,782
<font color=#FFFF00>You just watch.</font>

584
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:51,082
<font color=#FFFF00>(Min Hyo Joo)</font>

585
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:53,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, go ahead.</font>

586
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,981
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked you meet me at my office.
What's taking you so long?</font>

587
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:58,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I just got out of jail, you know.
I have a lot to catch up on.</font>

588
00:35:58,712 --> 00:35:59,981
<font color=#FFFF00>You talked as if you'd...</font>

589
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:03,028
<font color=#FFFF00>be able to change Yun Shil's mind
right away if I help you get out.</font>

590
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,411
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is going on?</font>

591
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Things don't always work out the
way you want them to, you know.</font>

592
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:08,882
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

593
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:11,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you giving up on your wife?</font>

594
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:12,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

595
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:16,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how I feel about all this.
I need time to think.</font>

596
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:25,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Wolgyesu Custom Suit Cooperative...</font>

597
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:29,681
<font color=#FFFF00>is a cooperative union of top-notch

598
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:32,582
<font color=#FFFF00>of consistently producing the
highest-quality bespoke suits.</font>

599
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:34,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Our cooperative's official address...</font>

600
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:36,351
<font color=#FFFF00>will be here, Wolgyesu Tailor Shop...</font>

601
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:37,881
<font color=#FFFF00>located in Hyoja-dong, Seoul.</font>

602
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:40,581
<font color=#FFFF00>From now on, the members will co-own...</font>

603
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:43,262
<font color=#FFFF00>all orders and production. Selling
will also be done cooperatively.</font>

604
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:47,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm honoured to work with the
best tailors in the country.</font>

605
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,782
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our master tailor, Bae Sam Do.</font>

606
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:56,412
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our human sewing machine.</font>

607
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:01,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Last but not least, this
beautiful tailor here...</font>

608
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:03,152
<font color=#FFFF00>is my wife.</font>

609
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:06,582
<font color=#FFFF00>She's so beautiful.</font>

610
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:08,912
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, she's very pretty.</font>

611
00:37:18,382 --> 00:37:19,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

612
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:24,751
<font color=#FFFF00>You did such a great job.</font>

613
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:26,382
<font color=#FFFF00>That feels so nice.</font>

614
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:28,982
<font color=#FFFF00>You even give good massages.</font>

615
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:33,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What an eyesore.</font>

616
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:37,181
<font color=#FFFF00>At home, Dong Sook and Tae Pyung
are lovey-dovey all the time.</font>

617
00:37:37,182 --> 00:37:39,612
<font color=#FFFF00>And I have to put up with you
two when I'm at work. Gosh.</font>

618
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:42,152
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to live in a world
without newlyweds.</font>

619
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:45,411
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, how are Mr Lee and Ms Choi?</font>

620
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:47,451
<font color=#FFFF00>I just spoke to Dong Sook on the phone.</font>

621
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:50,752
<font color=#FFFF00>They got there safe and sound. She
and Tae Pyung are on their way back.</font>

622
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Are Mum and Dad both okay?</font>

623
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:56,151
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. She said the house is
actually very clean and cosy...</font>

624
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:58,312
<font color=#FFFF00>and that they'd be pretty
comfortable there.</font>

625
00:37:58,682 --> 00:38:00,651
<font color=#FFFF00>I see. I'm glad to hear that,</font>

626
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,581
<font color=#FFFF00>but it still worries me
that they're there alone.</font>

627
00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:04,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thinking about visiting
them on my day off.</font>

628
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:10,611
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll announce the Employee of the Month.</font>

629
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,551
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Bok Sun Nyeo. Please come forward.</font>

630
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:13,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, me?</font>

631
00:38:17,522 --> 00:38:19,042
<font color=#FFFF00>(Employee of the Month Award Ceremony)</font>

632
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:22,151
<font color=#FFFF00>Employee of the Month, Bok Sun Nyeo.</font>

633
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:26,381
<font color=#FFFF00>This person has been carrying out
all of her given tasks efficiently,</font>

634
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:30,481
<font color=#FFFF00>and her strong work ethic has set
an example for her co-workers.</font>

635
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Hence, she has been chosen as
the Employee of the Month.</font>

636
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

637
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:37,051
<font color=#FFFF00>The Employee of the Month, Bok Sun Nyeo,</font>

638
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:40,712
<font color=#FFFF00>will receive cash prize as
well as 40g of pure gold.</font>

639
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll work harder from now on.</font>

640
00:38:58,752 --> 00:38:59,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do it!</font>

641
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:04,912
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the schedule for this week.</font>

642
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:07,752
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh.</font>

643
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,411
<font color=#FFFF00>He's booked back to back with TV shows.</font>

644
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:12,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung's song is so popular
these days, you know.</font>

645
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:15,952
<font color=#FFFF00>We actually tried to cut down.
Is it still too much?</font>

646
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:19,982
<font color=#FFFF00>No, don't worry. I should be
grateful for the opportunities.</font>

647
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:23,182
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, is the CEO still abroad?</font>

648
00:39:23,352 --> 00:39:26,281
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd love to meet him so that
I can thank him in person.</font>

649
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,812
<font color=#FFFF00>My boss arrived yesterday. You
two should be able to meet soon.</font>

650
00:39:30,522 --> 00:39:34,182
<font color=#FFFF00>What's he like?</font>

651
00:39:34,282 --> 00:39:37,158
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no photo of him on your website.
I'm just curious.</font>

652
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:38,881
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he broad-minded and fun?</font>

653
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:40,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Or is he more of the intellectual type?</font>

654
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:42,681
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he older?</font>

655
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:45,151
<font color=#FFFF00>My boss is a woman.</font>

656
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,451
<font color=#FFFF00>- A woman?
- A woman?</font>

657
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:47,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

658
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:52,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Lee Yeon Jun is a masculine name.</font>

659
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:54,311
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it was a man.</font>

660
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:55,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Me, too.</font>

661
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:59,181
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness...</font>

662
00:39:59,182 --> 00:40:00,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying, Mum.</font>

663
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:02,521
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried that you might faint.</font>

664
00:40:02,522 --> 00:40:07,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have listened to Hyo Sang.</font>

665
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:12,482
<font color=#FFFF00>We lost everything we had.</font>

666
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:17,312
<font color=#FFFF00>What a disaster...</font>

667
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,182
<font color=#FFFF00>He meant well.</font>

668
00:40:25,952 --> 00:40:28,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so upset. Lie down, Mum.</font>

669
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:33,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I need a bed. I can't
lie down on the floor.</font>

670
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:36,022
<font color=#FFFF00>It hurts my back!</font>

671
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,252
<font color=#FFFF00>We should buy a bed first thing tomorrow.</font>

672
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:44,158
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll buy you a bed tomorrow.</font>

673
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:46,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I'm coming in.</font>

674
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:47,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

675
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I changed the door knob and
also fixed all the lights.</font>

676
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:57,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

677
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang, are you looking down on me...</font>

678
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:04,811
<font color=#FFFF00>- because I'm penniless now?
- Pardon?</font>

679
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:07,021
<font color=#FFFF00>Who told you that you can change
our door knob and light bulbs?</font>

680
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:10,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, Mum. He did all the work.
Why are you being mean to him?</font>

681
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:12,351
<font color=#FFFF00>You're hugely mistaken if you
think that you can go ahead...</font>

682
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:14,481
<font color=#FFFF00>and marry Hyo Won just because
our family went bankrupt.</font>

683
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:17,182
<font color=#FFFF00>My opinion of you has not
changed even by one bit.</font>

684
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,351
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get going now.</font>

685
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how distressed you are,
but please don't skip meals.</font>

686
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:24,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Please cheer up.</font>

687
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:28,252
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to see me out.
Stay with your mum.</font>

688
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:34,681
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you taking things out on Tae Yang?</font>

689
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:37,022
<font color=#FFFF00>He made such a big
sacrifice for our family.</font>

690
00:41:38,282 --> 00:41:41,152
<font color=#FFFF00>He made a sacrifice for us?
What do you mean by that?</font>

691
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind. It's nothing.</font>

692
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:46,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to say goodbye to him
and head out for my shift.</font>

693
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:52,182
<font color=#FFFF00>What's she saying?</font>

694
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:59,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope your mum pulls herself
together soon. I'm worried.</font>

695
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:02,852
<font color=#FFFF00>She's just shocked by what happened.</font>

696
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:04,782
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll get better soon.</font>

697
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:08,482
<font color=#FFFF00>She's really good at adapting
to new surroundings.</font>

698
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:16,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

699
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were the spoiled
youngest one of the family,</font>

700
00:42:19,452 --> 00:42:21,282
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm realising how mature you are.</font>

701
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:26,551
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, I never thought that
you'd handle this so maturely.</font>

702
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:28,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone is extremely stressed out,</font>

703
00:42:28,652 --> 00:42:30,892
<font color=#FFFF00>so I thought I should try to
be an anchor for my family.</font>

704
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:35,051
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm quite great, aren't I?</font>

705
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,582
<font color=#FFFF00>"Great" isn't enough.</font>

706
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,312
<font color=#FFFF00>You're amazing.</font>

707
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:41,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for the compliment.</font>

708
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:47,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Hyo Sang by the way?</font>

709
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:51,152
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

710
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:55,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Yun left to stay with her friend,</font>

711
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:57,752
<font color=#FFFF00>saying that she needs some time to think.</font>

712
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:00,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does she need time to think?</font>

713
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,982
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really know.</font>

714
00:43:02,782 --> 00:43:06,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess she has a lot on her mind
because of my family's situation.</font>

715
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:17,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

716
00:43:18,022 --> 00:43:19,251
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Tae Yang.</font>

717
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:22,752
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you passed the exam. I'm
so impressed. Congratulations.</font>

718
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:24,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, Tae Yang.</font>

719
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations.</font>

720
00:43:26,112 --> 00:43:27,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

721
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:29,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so proud of you.</font>

722
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on a second. Then what will
happen to your modelling career?</font>

723
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,151
<font color=#FFFF00>Wouldn't you regret letting it go?</font>

724
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:37,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought of it as a short-term
thing, so I won't regret it.</font>

725
00:43:37,752 --> 00:43:38,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want a cup of tea?</font>

726
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:40,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Thanks.</font>

727
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:42,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

728
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:45,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, why are you looking so tired?</font>

729
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:46,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you do some sort of manual labour?</font>

730
00:43:46,852 --> 00:43:48,251
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won's family moved today,</font>

731
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:50,781
<font color=#FFFF00>so I helped them unpack. I
must look pretty rough now.</font>

732
00:43:50,782 --> 00:43:52,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did they move to?</font>

733
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:53,551
<font color=#FFFF00>It's close to your place.</font>

734
00:43:53,552 --> 00:43:56,551
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Are you saying Eun Sook
moved to this neighbourhood?</font>

735
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,081
<font color=#FFFF00>The house is a lot smaller compared
to where they used to live.</font>

736
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:00,952
<font color=#FFFF00>She's having a hard time adjusting.</font>

737
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:04,751
<font color=#FFFF00>She always talked about
how much she hates...</font>

738
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyoja-dong and this shop.</font>

739
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:09,281
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so ironic that she's back here now.</font>

740
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:10,282
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

741
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:12,651
<font color=#FFFF00>She used to live in this neighbourhood?</font>

742
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:15,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, she used to work as a
bookkeeper at our shop.</font>

743
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:17,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea.</font>

744
00:44:18,912 --> 00:44:20,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at this.</font>

745
00:44:21,052 --> 00:44:24,952
<font color=#FFFF00>(Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

746
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:27,412
<font color=#FFFF00>How is Hyo Won?</font>

747
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:31,612
<font color=#FFFF00>She pretends to be okay.</font>

748
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:33,552
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll get used to it.</font>

749
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:36,182
<font color=#FFFF00>She's cheerful and positive.</font>

750
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:38,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you feeling better?</font>

751
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:41,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to forget about it all.</font>

752
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm angry that...</font>

753
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:45,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasted 10 years of my life,</font>

754
00:44:46,512 --> 00:44:48,652
<font color=#FFFF00>but at least now I know the truth.</font>

755
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:50,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's a relief.</font>

756
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:53,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Now you have Dong Jin,</font>

757
00:44:54,312 --> 00:44:56,852
<font color=#FFFF00>- focus on happy thoughts.
- I will.</font>

758
00:44:59,182 --> 00:45:00,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Dong Jin very busy?</font>

759
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:03,052
<font color=#FFFF00>He's working on the Tonelli deal,</font>

760
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:05,812
<font color=#FFFF00>and Meesa Apparel wants him to return.</font>

761
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:07,812
<font color=#FFFF00>He has a lot to think about.</font>

762
00:45:09,382 --> 00:45:11,652
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you mind?
- How do you mean?</font>

763
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:14,252
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be weird for him
to go back to Meesa.</font>

764
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:17,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't his ex-wife an executive?</font>

765
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:21,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not that shallow or jealous.</font>

766
00:45:22,182 --> 00:45:25,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I trust Dong Jin completely,
in any situation.</font>

767
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:26,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mind.</font>

768
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:36,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Gianni.</font>

769
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:40,551
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you feel about my
returning to Meesa Apparel?</font>

770
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:43,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I heard that Meesa
Apparel was going bankrupt,</font>

771
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:46,551
<font color=#FFFF00>but honestly, I'm surprised to hear that...</font>

772
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:48,382
<font color=#FFFF00>you're going back to Meesa Apparel.</font>

773
00:45:48,552 --> 00:45:52,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to grow our Wolgyesu
Tonelli brand beyond Korea.</font>

774
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:56,081
<font color=#FFFF00>And make it the top suit
brand in Asia and the world,</font>

775
00:45:56,082 --> 00:45:57,252
<font color=#FFFF00>with you, Dong Jin.</font>

776
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:59,352
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going to happen to our project?</font>

777
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:02,451
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be in charge of the
Wolgyesu Tonelli project...</font>

778
00:46:02,452 --> 00:46:04,181
<font color=#FFFF00>until it will be stable.</font>

779
00:46:04,182 --> 00:46:06,251
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're going to take on Meesa Apparel,</font>

780
00:46:06,252 --> 00:46:07,952
<font color=#FFFF00>what's going to happen to Tonelli?</font>

781
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:12,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Tonelli won't accept any changes
that threaten the brand.</font>

782
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Will Mr Bae manage production?</font>

783
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:16,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, he will, but don't worry, Gianni.</font>

784
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:19,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything's going to
be fine, as we planned.</font>

785
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:21,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's going to replace you?</font>

786
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I have someone in mind.</font>

787
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,982
<font color=#FFFF00>I trust your judgement, Dong Jin.</font>

788
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:28,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, thanks.</font>

789
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you carsick?</font>

790
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:32,452
<font color=#FFFF00>How is your new house?</font>

791
00:46:33,382 --> 00:46:35,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I see, that's great.</font>

792
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:37,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo and I...</font>

793
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,482
<font color=#FFFF00>will visit you this weekend.</font>

794
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:42,681
<font color=#FFFF00>Try to make do until then.</font>

795
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll fix everything for you.</font>

796
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:45,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Goodnight.</font>

797
00:46:47,052 --> 00:46:48,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh dear.</font>

798
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:56,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you go drinking again?</font>

799
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I was in a good mood,</font>

800
00:47:00,882 --> 00:47:02,312
<font color=#FFFF00>so I bought a few rounds.</font>

801
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:05,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at this.</font>

802
00:47:07,112 --> 00:47:08,551
<font color=#FFFF00>Sam Do.</font>

803
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:11,982
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet you've never seen anything like this.</font>

804
00:47:14,752 --> 00:47:16,852
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this? "Employee of the Month"?</font>

805
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,811
<font color=#FFFF00>The branch manager said...</font>

806
00:47:19,812 --> 00:47:22,451
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his best employee so far...</font>

807
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:24,411
<font color=#FFFF00>because I made a record profit...</font>

808
00:47:24,412 --> 00:47:27,711
<font color=#FFFF00>in a record-breaking short
period and he complimented me.</font>

809
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,352
<font color=#FFFF00>He just said that to make you feel good.</font>

810
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:34,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this gold?</font>

811
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:37,982
<font color=#FFFF00>That's 40g of 24k pure gold.</font>

812
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:39,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see.</font>

813
00:47:44,052 --> 00:47:46,652
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's real gold.
- It is, isn't it?</font>

814
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:50,852
<font color=#FFFF00>This is what your wife is capable of.</font>

815
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Do not belittle me.</font>

816
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,252
<font color=#FFFF00>When did I belittle you? I never did.</font>

817
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:57,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen such a huge chunk of gold.</font>

818
00:47:57,852 --> 00:47:58,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Me, neither.</font>

819
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:02,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Dong Jin very busy?</font>

820
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:04,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, with the tailor union...</font>

821
00:48:04,052 --> 00:48:06,051
<font color=#FFFF00>and the Tonelli project.</font>

822
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard about Meesa Apparel.</font>

823
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:09,611
<font color=#FFFF00>He's focusing on Wolgyesu.</font>

824
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:12,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that mean he isn't interested
in going back to Meesa?</font>

825
00:48:12,812 --> 00:48:14,182
<font color=#FFFF00>He's still thinking.</font>

826
00:48:14,312 --> 00:48:17,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you mind that he might go back?</font>

827
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:19,952
<font color=#FFFF00>If he works there,</font>

828
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:22,651
<font color=#FFFF00>he'll have to deal with his ex-wife.</font>

829
00:48:22,652 --> 00:48:25,512
<font color=#FFFF00>It can't be helped if it's about business.</font>

830
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:26,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mind.</font>

831
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:54,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Pour me one.</font>

832
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:04,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I have a soju, please?</font>

833
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,082
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

834
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:12,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm joining so you don't look so pathetic.</font>

835
00:49:13,552 --> 00:49:14,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

836
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:16,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this a joke?</font>

837
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:19,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

838
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:22,612
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a public area. Calm down.</font>

839
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:25,582
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I calm down? Get out of my face.</font>

840
00:49:29,012 --> 00:49:30,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Why you...</font>

841
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:42,952
<font color=#FFFF00>How's Yun Shil?</font>

842
00:49:44,412 --> 00:49:45,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she okay?</font>

843
00:49:46,312 --> 00:49:47,352
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

844
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:51,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Does she blame and hate me?</font>

845
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:54,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Rather than that,</font>

846
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,712
<font color=#FFFF00>she's trying her best to forget about it.</font>

847
00:50:02,682 --> 00:50:03,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil...</font>

848
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:06,652
<font color=#FFFF00>will forget all about you.</font>

849
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:10,152
<font color=#FFFF00>She lost 10 years of her
life and that's enough.</font>

850
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a question.</font>

851
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:18,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell her I
didn't donate a kidney?</font>

852
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:20,282
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to...</font>

853
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,012
<font color=#FFFF00>give you a chance to tell her yourself.</font>

854
00:50:25,412 --> 00:50:27,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Rather than she hear it
from somewhere else,</font>

855
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you should tell her
and ask for forgiveness.</font>

856
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:32,981
<font color=#FFFF00>That would make it easier for her.</font>

857
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:34,012
<font color=#FFFF00>What a joke.</font>

858
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:37,381
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew I'd go to her so you waited.</font>

859
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:38,482
<font color=#FFFF00>It was to mess with me.</font>

860
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:42,012
<font color=#FFFF00>- Am I right?
- You said you loved her.</font>

861
00:50:45,382 --> 00:50:46,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe it.</font>

862
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:51,652
<font color=#FFFF00>In the warehouse,</font>

863
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:56,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw you subconsciously
go to save her first.</font>

864
00:50:57,382 --> 00:51:00,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw the love you talked
about wasn't all a lie.</font>

865
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:01,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I acknowledged that.</font>

866
00:51:02,412 --> 00:51:05,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't save her to gain
your acknowledgement.</font>

867
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:06,752
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not love.</font>

868
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:09,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Love...</font>

869
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:13,012
<font color=#FFFF00>is not fitting a person into what you want.</font>

870
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:16,612
<font color=#FFFF00>It's changing yourself to conform
with what the other wants.</font>

871
00:51:16,752 --> 00:51:18,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you lecturing me?</font>

872
00:51:18,382 --> 00:51:19,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil...</font>

873
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:23,652
<font color=#FFFF00>was never on the same wavelength as you.</font>

874
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,452
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not love.</font>

875
00:51:28,012 --> 00:51:29,352
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just an obsession.</font>

876
00:51:30,612 --> 00:51:31,652
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

877
00:51:32,982 --> 00:51:35,552
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you do what she wanted?
- No.</font>

878
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:38,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm still trying.</font>

879
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:42,981
<font color=#FFFF00>I think and wonder every single day...</font>

880
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:44,812
<font color=#FFFF00>how to make her happy.</font>

881
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:47,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Because that makes me happy.</font>

882
00:51:50,282 --> 00:51:51,352
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

883
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:53,612
<font color=#FFFF00>if you sincerely loved her...</font>

884
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:55,652
<font color=#FFFF00>and feel bad for what you did,</font>

885
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:59,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I say it's best that you try
to think what you can do...</font>

886
00:52:00,682 --> 00:52:01,982
<font color=#FFFF00>to make her happy.</font>

887
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,512
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you have a drink?
- Do I smell?</font>

888
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:26,252
<font color=#FFFF00>I had just two shots.</font>

889
00:52:26,712 --> 00:52:27,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go inside, it's cold.</font>

890
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:34,158
<font color=#FFFF00>I talked to Mother earlier today.</font>

891
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:36,881
<font color=#FFFF00>They went for a walk on the beach.</font>

892
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:38,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they? Are they okay?</font>

893
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:39,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Your aunt...</font>

894
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:42,351
<font color=#FFFF00>renovated the house not so long ago.</font>

895
00:52:42,352 --> 00:52:44,111
<font color=#FFFF00>It's clean and cozy.</font>

896
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:47,551
<font color=#FFFF00>She said Father will have no
trouble memorising the layout.</font>

897
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:49,682
<font color=#FFFF00>There will still be a lot
to do around the house.</font>

898
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:53,552
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll need bars on the
walls and safety measures.</font>

899
00:52:53,652 --> 00:52:56,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I said we'd visit on our day off.</font>

900
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:00,452
<font color=#FFFF00>- Good.
- Is something wrong?</font>

901
00:53:00,982 --> 00:53:02,181
<font color=#FFFF00>You look downcast.</font>

902
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,382
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess I'm just tired.</font>

903
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:07,181
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have you eaten?
- I'm not hungry.</font>

904
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:10,852
<font color=#FFFF00>You eat when it's time,
not because you want to.</font>

905
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:13,682
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what my mum said.</font>

906
00:53:13,782 --> 00:53:15,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I learned it from her.</font>

907
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out in a bit. I'll set the table.</font>

908
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:32,482
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry, Mum.
- What now?</font>

909
00:53:33,882 --> 00:53:35,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you apologising
as soon as you come in?</font>

910
00:53:36,552 --> 00:53:39,081
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is going on?</font>

911
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you please not shout?</font>

912
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,181
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been arguing all day.</font>

913
00:53:44,182 --> 00:53:45,782
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm exhausted as it is.</font>

914
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Whose fault is this? It's yours.</font>

915
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,782
<font color=#FFFF00>- How dare you shout at me.
- I didn't think this would happen!</font>

916
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:55,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just as upset as you are!</font>

917
00:53:58,082 --> 00:53:59,082
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth...</font>

918
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:02,312
<font color=#FFFF00>have you decided to do with your wife?</font>

919
00:54:02,712 --> 00:54:03,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you splitting up?</font>

920
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would we split up?</font>

921
00:54:06,052 --> 00:54:08,381
<font color=#FFFF00>She just needs time to think.</font>

922
00:54:08,382 --> 00:54:10,052
<font color=#FFFF00>To think about what?</font>

923
00:54:10,652 --> 00:54:12,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Of a way to run away,</font>

924
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:14,811
<font color=#FFFF00>- now that we're bankrupt?
- Mum!</font>

925
00:54:14,812 --> 00:54:15,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Get a grip.</font>

926
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:19,781
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm positive that Ji Yun
married you for our money.</font>

927
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:22,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you tell? She left as
soon as we went bankrupt.</font>

928
00:54:22,782 --> 00:54:25,851
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like that! Why
do you keep saying that?</font>

929
00:54:25,852 --> 00:54:27,112
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so mean.</font>

930
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:33,152
<font color=#FFFF00>We're done for. We're ruined.</font>

931
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:37,052
<font color=#FFFF00>- We're all ruined.
- I'm home.</font>

932
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:40,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

933
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:45,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I have much long to live.</font>

934
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm practically penniless.</font>

935
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,811
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the point in living?</font>

936
00:54:51,812 --> 00:54:53,582
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't say that.</font>

937
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:57,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Things are bad now, but they'll get better.</font>

938
00:54:57,282 --> 00:55:00,082
<font color=#FFFF00>How can it get better
when we lost everything?</font>

939
00:55:00,182 --> 00:55:03,411
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so positive. Who do you take after?</font>

940
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:05,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang said that's
what he likes about me.</font>

941
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wondering why you
didn't mention him already.</font>

942
00:55:18,012 --> 00:55:19,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Was the house this big?</font>

943
00:55:25,282 --> 00:55:27,852
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a nice thing to say,</font>

944
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:29,911
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm a bit scared.</font>

945
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:31,182
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

946
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:35,581
<font color=#FFFF00>The huge house suddenly
feels so cold and empty.</font>

947
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,352
<font color=#FFFF00>It's borderline scary if you ask me.</font>

948
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:40,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I keep having bad thoughts.</font>

949
00:55:53,982 --> 00:55:55,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Turnip soup?</font>

950
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,151
<font color=#FFFF00>I made some because
Mother said you like it.</font>

951
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:00,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see.</font>

952
00:56:03,582 --> 00:56:05,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, it tastes great.</font>

953
00:56:05,952 --> 00:56:09,282
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure it does. I
followed Mother's recipe.</font>

954
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:14,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at me?</font>

955
00:56:14,712 --> 00:56:17,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Looking at you makes me happy.</font>

956
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:22,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know you say corny things
as if it's nothing at all?</font>

957
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:25,682
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the kind of sweet person I am.</font>

958
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:35,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Just watching you eat makes me feel full.</font>

959
00:56:36,482 --> 00:56:38,652
<font color=#FFFF00>You can be just as corny.</font>

960
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:41,082
<font color=#FFFF00>We're a corny couple.</font>

961
00:56:41,952 --> 00:56:42,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you happy?</font>

962
00:56:43,282 --> 00:56:46,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if I'm making you happy.</font>

963
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,851
<font color=#FFFF00>I always do.</font>

964
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:49,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

965
00:56:49,112 --> 00:56:52,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never been this happy my whole life.</font>

966
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:55,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you, I now have a family...</font>

967
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:58,451
<font color=#FFFF00>and thanks to them, I was able...</font>

968
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:00,112
<font color=#FFFF00>to overcome a rough patch.</font>

969
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:04,652
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, when I'm
with you and your family,</font>

970
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:07,451
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't feel so bad or angry about...</font>

971
00:57:07,452 --> 00:57:10,182
<font color=#FFFF00>the 10 years I lost because of Gi Pyo.</font>

972
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:15,251
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, because I fled to
Seoul to get away from him,</font>

973
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:17,511
<font color=#FFFF00>I got a job at Wolgyesu,</font>

974
00:57:17,512 --> 00:57:19,611
<font color=#FFFF00>I met your parents,</font>

975
00:57:19,612 --> 00:57:21,682
<font color=#FFFF00>and then I met you.</font>

976
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:24,811
<font color=#FFFF00>You are so positive.</font>

977
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:26,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so proud of you.</font>

978
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:30,851
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you to be proud of me,</font>

979
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:33,252
<font color=#FFFF00>so I'll be more cheerful and positive.</font>

980
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:37,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for making me want
to become a better person.</font>

981
00:57:38,712 --> 00:57:40,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel the same.</font>

982
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:53,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil was never on the
same wavelength as you.</font>

983
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:58,512
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not love. It's just an obsession.</font>

984
00:58:01,182 --> 00:58:02,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

985
00:58:04,082 --> 00:58:06,982
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do to make you happy?</font>

986
00:58:10,012 --> 00:58:11,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Can Dong Jin...</font>

987
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:14,782
<font color=#FFFF00>really make you happy?</font>

988
00:58:24,452 --> 00:58:25,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

989
00:58:28,412 --> 00:58:29,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

990
00:58:30,082 --> 00:58:31,158
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

991
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:32,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

992
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:35,812
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you?</font>

993
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:38,452
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while.</font>

994
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations on your marriage.</font>

995
00:58:42,182 --> 00:58:44,751
<font color=#FFFF00>It's only right that I wish you well.</font>

996
00:58:44,752 --> 00:58:47,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. I'll make you some tea.</font>

997
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:54,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to ask for a favour.</font>

998
00:58:54,752 --> 00:58:56,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Please sit.</font>

999
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:07,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know the situation Meesa's in?</font>

1000
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:09,482
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes.
- And...</font>

1001
00:59:10,152 --> 00:59:11,682
<font color=#FFFF00>you won't do anything about it?</font>

1002
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa Apparel...</font>

1003
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:18,812
<font color=#FFFF00>was my husband's pride and joy
and lifetime achievement.</font>

1004
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:22,051
<font color=#FFFF00>You served and worked closely with him.</font>

1005
00:59:22,052 --> 00:59:23,782
<font color=#FFFF00>You must know that.</font>

1006
00:59:24,552 --> 00:59:26,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that...</font>

1007
00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:30,052
<font color=#FFFF00>you think it's shameless
of me and it's silly,</font>

1008
00:59:30,912 --> 00:59:33,752
<font color=#FFFF00>but I want you to take over the company.</font>

1009
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa was my husband's other half.</font>

1010
00:59:38,182 --> 00:59:39,481
<font color=#FFFF00>It might get broken up...</font>

1011
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:42,552
<font color=#FFFF00>or sold to someone who
knows nothing about suits.</font>

1012
00:59:42,782 --> 00:59:45,382
<font color=#FFFF00>All this seems like my fault.</font>

1013
00:59:47,552 --> 00:59:49,182
<font color=#FFFF00>When I die,</font>

1014
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:52,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't dare face him like this.</font>

1015
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:55,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, Dong Jin.</font>

1016
00:59:56,612 --> 00:59:58,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it for him.</font>

1017
00:59:58,582 --> 01:00:01,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Please save Meesa Apparel from this mess.</font>

1018
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:02,882
<font color=#FFFF00>I have...</font>

1019
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,681
<font color=#FFFF00>- a condition.
- A condition?</font>

1020
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:06,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Send Hyo Sang...</font>

1021
01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:10,912
<font color=#FFFF00>to work at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

1022
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:12,452
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1023
01:00:13,082 --> 01:00:16,351
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the best place where he
can learn about the philosophy...</font>

1024
01:00:16,352 --> 01:00:19,182
<font color=#FFFF00>of suit making that the late
chairman always talked about.</font>

1025
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,158
<font color=#FFFF00>It will take time,</font>

1026
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:23,581
<font color=#FFFF00>but once he learns the basics,</font>

1027
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:26,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll call him back to Meesa Apparel.</font>

1028
01:00:30,052 --> 01:00:32,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been all this while?</font>

1029
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:34,281
<font color=#FFFF00>- I met with a lawyer.
- What for?</font>

1030
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:36,981
<font color=#FFFF00>The board's going to sue
me for compensation.</font>

1031
01:00:36,982 --> 01:00:38,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take legal action.</font>

1032
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:41,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you please stop?</font>

1033
01:00:45,252 --> 01:00:46,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Hand over your title...</font>

1034
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:48,781
<font color=#FFFF00>- to Dong Jin.
- Mum!</font>

1035
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:51,411
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't, the creditors will sell.</font>

1036
01:00:51,412 --> 01:00:53,081
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll split Meesa up.</font>

1037
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,381
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather see that happen...</font>

1038
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:57,251
<font color=#FFFF00>than let Dong Jin take over.</font>

1039
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:59,751
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- I can't give in to him.</font>

1040
01:00:59,752 --> 01:01:03,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Your late dad put his whole life
into making Meesa what it is.</font>

1041
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:07,382
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say you'd
rather see it get split up?</font>

1042
01:01:07,852 --> 01:01:10,452
<font color=#FFFF00>I will not lose to Dong Jin.</font>

1043
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:12,581
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather die...</font>

1044
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:15,182
<font color=#FFFF00>than let him take my CEO title.</font>

1045
01:01:19,182 --> 01:01:22,252
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come into my
office without knocking.</font>

1046
01:01:24,412 --> 01:01:26,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you do as I said?</font>

1047
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I switched the labels and
handed over the goods.</font>

1048
01:01:29,112 --> 01:01:30,411
<font color=#FFFF00>And the payment?</font>

1049
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:33,481
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll bring cash to an agreed location.</font>

1050
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that your voice?</font>

1051
01:01:35,512 --> 01:01:37,881
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's your son's voice.</font>

1052
01:01:37,882 --> 01:01:38,882
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that?</font>

1053
01:01:38,883 --> 01:01:41,582
<font color=#FFFF00>If I release this, you'll go to prison.</font>

1054
01:01:41,752 --> 01:01:43,881
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Are you crazy?</font>

1055
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:45,511
<font color=#FFFF00>You never paid me,</font>

1056
01:01:45,512 --> 01:01:48,051
<font color=#FFFF00>and I lost my wife while
doing time for you.</font>

1057
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:49,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course I'm crazy.</font>

1058
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:51,282
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want?</font>

1059
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:52,712
<font color=#FFFF00>The CEO title.</font>

1060
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:56,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Hand it over to Dong Jin.</font>

1061
01:01:57,382 --> 01:01:58,452
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1062
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:11,052
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why are you here?
- To give you some advice.</font>

1063
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:12,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Advice?</font>

1064
01:02:16,812 --> 01:02:19,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Just when I was getting
somewhere with this song.</font>

1065
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:24,351
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Tae Pyung, the gentleman of trot.</font>

1066
01:02:24,352 --> 01:02:27,011
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Kim Sung Oh from WN Entertainment.</font>

1067
01:02:27,012 --> 01:02:28,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yes, hello.</font>

1068
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:32,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Our CEO wishes to see you. Are you free?</font>

1069
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now? Of course.</font>

1070
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:37,451
<font color=#FFFF00>She wants to see you alone,
without your manager.</font>

1071
01:02:37,452 --> 01:02:38,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Alone?</font>

1072
01:02:44,882 --> 01:02:45,911
<font color=#FFFF00>(So and You)</font>

1073
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:47,052
<font color=#FFFF00>(Urology)</font>

1074
01:02:48,052 --> 01:02:49,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Urology.</font>

1075
01:02:52,112 --> 01:02:55,251
<font color=#FFFF00>How did the meeting with
Mr Lee Dong Jin go?</font>

1076
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:56,812
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't heard from him yet.</font>

1077
01:02:57,182 --> 01:03:00,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Does this mean we must sell the company?</font>

1078
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:05,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that BS Fashion offered
our creditors a decent deal.</font>

1079
01:03:05,812 --> 01:03:10,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Has Mr Lee given up on Meesa Apparel?</font>

1080
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:15,112
<font color=#FFFF00>(Meesa Apparel's 26th Board Meeting)</font>

1081
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a bit late. I apologise.</font>

1082
01:03:51,252 --> 01:03:54,951
<font color=#FFFF00>The blood test results show
your hormone levels are low...</font>

1083
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:57,311
<font color=#FFFF00>and out of balance.</font>

1084
01:03:57,312 --> 01:03:59,082
<font color=#FFFF00>To put it easily,</font>

1085
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:01,912
<font color=#FFFF00>you have the male equivalent of menopause.</font>

1086
01:04:05,182 --> 01:04:07,152
<font color=#FFFF00>What will happen to me, then?</font>

1087
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:10,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Is my life as a man...</font>

1088
01:04:19,182 --> 01:04:20,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Pack your things...</font>

1089
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:23,612
<font color=#FFFF00>- and move in with Hyo Won.
- What?</font>

1090
01:04:23,712 --> 01:04:25,912
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're up to something...</font>

1091
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:27,882
<font color=#FFFF00>because they lost everything,</font>

1092
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,552
<font color=#FFFF00>it means you married Hyo
Sang for his money.</font>

1093
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:34,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang,</font>

1094
01:04:35,012 --> 01:04:36,951
<font color=#FFFF00>what gives you the right to lecture me?</font>

1095
01:04:36,952 --> 01:04:38,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Choi Ji Yun!</font>

1096
01:04:40,612 --> 01:04:41,892
<font color=#FFFF00>Unless you want to become trash,</font>

1097
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:44,052
<font color=#FFFF00>go back to where you belong.</font>

1098
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:47,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Has it been 15 years?</font>

1099
01:04:47,912 --> 01:04:50,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I missed you a lot, Jun...</font>

1100
01:04:50,382 --> 01:04:53,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I call you Tae Pyung now?</font>

1101
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:55,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Hee.</font>

1102
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:57,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

1103
01:04:58,682 --> 01:05:01,682
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Lee Yeon Jun, the CEO
of WN Entertainment.</font>

1104
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:06,682
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Yeon Hee and Sung Jun.</font>

1105
01:05:07,052 --> 01:05:08,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Jun.</font>

1106
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:15,652
<font color=#FFFF00>We requested you return
as Meesa Apparel's CEO.</font>

1107
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,952
<font color=#FFFF00>May we assume you accepted the offer?</font>

1108
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:23,282
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to think long and hard about it.</font>

1109
01:05:23,612 --> 01:05:24,652
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm late.</font>

1110
01:05:25,452 --> 01:05:26,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I shall...</font>

1111
01:05:30,082 --> 01:05:31,182
<font color=#FFFF00>accept your offer.</font>

1112
01:06:03,352 --> 01:06:06,012
<font color=#FFFF00>(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

1113
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:08,051
<font color=#FFFF00>The rightful owner is back.</font>

1114
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:09,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything's back in its place.</font>

1115
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:12,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't think you can make me change my mind.</font>

1116
01:06:12,712 --> 01:06:13,951
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my dad's death anniversary.</font>

1117
01:06:13,952 --> 01:06:17,251
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't come, I'll take it
to mean you want to leave me.</font>

1118
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:19,181
<font color=#FFFF00>To overcome my male menopause?</font>

1119
01:06:19,182 --> 01:06:21,551
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of exercise have you been doing?</font>

1120
01:06:21,552 --> 01:06:22,951
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be direct.</font>

1121
01:06:22,952 --> 01:06:24,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you two dating?</font>

1122
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:26,551
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do anything to upset my wife.</font>

1123
01:06:26,552 --> 01:06:29,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop coming by whenever
you want and get out.</font>

1124
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop before you make a fool of yourself.</font>

1125
01:06:31,182 --> 01:06:32,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave my husband alone.</font>
