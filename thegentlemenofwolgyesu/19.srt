<font color="yellow">The man who visited me with Yun Shil?</font>

14
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,142
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

15
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,582
<font color="yellow">It's odd how we keep crossing paths.</font>

16
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:49,212
<font color="yellow">I get out in a few months.</font>

17

<font color="yellow">Just a moment. I'll put her on.</font>

19

34
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:50,582

<font color="yellow">They act like a lowlife for the rest of their lives.</font>

74
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,352
<font color="yellow">They torment others.</font>

75

76
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:00,382

77

<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

78
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,982
<font color="yellow">I bought it from the truck outside. Have some.</font>

79
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,942
<font color="yellow">This looks great. I'd skipped breakfast.</font>

80
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,812

<font color="yellow">I'm full.</font>

84
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:28,612
<font color="yellow">Did you eat breakfast? Then I'll have one more.</font>

85
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:34,112
<font color="yellow">Have a bite while it's still warm. Go on.</font>

86
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,142
<font color="yellow">It's nice and hot. Eat it and cheer up.</font>

87

<font color="yellow">We have a competition to prepare for.</font>

88
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,082

89
00:05:43,282 --> 00:05:44,642
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

90
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,442

<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

93
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,412
<font color="yellow">You really went too far this time.</font>

94
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:21,912
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go out to work? Why are you back?</font>

95
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,842
<font color="yellow">The captain sent me home.</font>

96
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:27,082
<font color="yellow">- I can't work with wounded hand. - Too bad.</font>

97
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,342
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

98
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,412
<font color="yellow">You didn't give Sam Do any breakfast,</font>

99
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:33,942
<font color="yellow">but look at this.</font>

100
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:37,982
<font color="yellow">Radish kimchi, eggplant, squash, carrot and a fried egg?</font>

101
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,212
<font color="yellow">That's a nice serving of bibimbap.</font>

102
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:42,712
<font color="yellow">Does it look good?</font>

103
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:44,612
<font color="yellow">It does.</font>

104
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,742
<font color="yellow">- Pick the right side. - What?</font>

105
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,682
<font color="yellow">If you want to eat my food, take my side,</font>

106
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:53,042
<font color="yellow">not Sam Do's.</font>

107
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,112
<font color="yellow">He did go a bit too far this time.</font>

108
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,382
<font color="yellow">You can imagine things if you want it badly enough.</font>

109
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:11,512
<font color="yellow">He shouldn't have said you embarrassed him...</font>

110
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:12,912
<font color="yellow">or mocked him.</font>

111
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,912
<font color="yellow">- No man should say that. - Exactly.</font>

112
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:21,342
<font color="yellow">I will pay him a visit at work later...</font>

113
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,312
<font color="yellow">and talk to him.</font>

114
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:26,682
<font color="yellow">- Try to forgive him. - Tell him this.</font>

115
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:30,942
<font color="yellow">If he expects to eat my food again, he has to see a doctor with me.</font>

116
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:32,382
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

117
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:35,142
<font color="yellow">I will talk to him and make sure that...</font>

118
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:36,982
<font color="yellow">he accompanies you tomorrow.</font>

119
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:39,442
<font color="yellow">I like what I hear.</font>

120
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:41,682
<font color="yellow">Here's a spoon.</font>

121
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,312
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

122
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:59,542

123
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,112
<font color="yellow">People who make a mean sujebi can cook noodles,</font>

124
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,842
<font color="yellow">and chicken stew experts make great bibimbap.</font>

125
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,042
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

126
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,482
<font color="yellow">I hope I marry...</font>

127
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:12,812
<font color="yellow">a woman who can cook as well as you.</font>

128
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:16,682

129
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,142
<font color="yellow">But then again,</font>

130
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,582

131
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:24,212
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry.</font>

132
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:27,082
<font color="yellow">Does she have a blind date today?</font>

133
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:29,942
<font color="yellow">You saw Ms Choi make her promise.</font>

134
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:34,342
<font color="yellow">I didn't think she'd go on the date so soon.</font>

135
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:39,482
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

136
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:44,012
<font color="yellow">Did hearing about the blind date ruin your appetite?</font>

137
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:47,782
<font color="yellow">Why would it?</font>

138
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,482
<font color="yellow">It's none of my business anyway.</font>

139
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:01,212
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

140
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:03,112
<font color="yellow">I should start looking for a job.</font>

141
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,952
<font color="yellow">I can't waste time.</font>

142
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:10,842
<font color="yellow">She's right.</font>

143
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:14,212
<font color="yellow">I can't waste time.</font>

144
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,042
<font color="yellow">Are you off work already?</font>

145
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,542
<font color="yellow">No, I don't work any more.</font>

146
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:31,282
<font color="yellow">I handed the store over to the new owner.</font>

147
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:35,642
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so gloomy?</font>

148
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:37,612
<font color="yellow">Do you eat well?</font>

149
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:39,982
<font color="yellow">I'm not hungry.</font>

150
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:42,342
<font color="yellow">You're a terrible judge of men.</font>

151
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,312
<font color="yellow">How will you survive the harsh world?</font>

152
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,812
<font color="yellow">How could you think of selling your store...</font>

153
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:49,412
<font color="yellow">for someone like Leather Jacket?</font>

154
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:52,212
<font color="yellow">- Stop bringing up the past. - Listen.</font>

155
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:54,742
<font color="yellow">Leather Jacket...</font>

156
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:57,342
<font color="yellow">is stuffing his face with the bibimbap...</font>

157
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,812
<font color="yellow">I was eating.</font>

158
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,212
<font color="yellow">- He's eating bibimbap? - Yes.</font>

159
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,342
<font color="yellow">He's such a noisy eater.</font>

160
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:04,482
<font color="yellow">It was gross.</font>

161
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:12,742
<font color="yellow">Is she naive or stupid?</font>

162
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:15,452
<font color="yellow">What a pity.</font>

163
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:34,212
<font color="yellow">- What do you want? - You're in.</font>

164
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:40,382
<font color="yellow">I made this doing community service.</font>

165
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,412
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back whenever I make anything.</font>

166
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,412
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I won't take so little at a time.</font>

167
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:52,142
<font color="yellow">I have no use for so little cash.</font>

168
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:56,082
<font color="yellow">Pay me back in one go when you have the 30,000 dollars.</font>

169
00:10:57,912 --> 00:10:59,312
<font color="yellow">"Little cash"?</font>

170
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:02,482
<font color="yellow">If that's what you think, okay.</font>

171
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:06,612
<font color="yellow">Step away from my daughter this instant.</font>

172
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:15,342
<font color="yellow">You gave me your word just a few days ago,</font>

173
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,882
<font color="yellow">and you're already whispering to her in my kitchen?</font>

174
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:21,142
<font color="yellow">I wasn't whispering. We had something to discuss.</font>

175
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:22,542
<font color="yellow">Get out while you still can.</font>

176
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:25,082
<font color="yellow">Or else, I might just throw you out of this house again.</font>

177
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:28,142
<font color="yellow">Right. I'll leave you, then.</font>

178
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,382
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there.</font>

179
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:40,112
<font color="yellow">Go to the sauna and get cleaned up.</font>

180
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,982
<font color="yellow">Then, go and get your hair done at a salon.</font>

181
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,982
<font color="yellow">- I can't be bothered to. - Don't say that.</font>

182
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,782
<font color="yellow">You need to look as young as you can to make him like you.</font>

183
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:54,882
<font color="yellow">Forget it. If he doesn't want an old wife, he can stuff it.</font>

184
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:56,512
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

185
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:57,982
<font color="yellow">How dare you say that.</font>

186
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:00,282
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine, I'll go.</font>

187
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,312
<font color="yellow">How is work? Is it manageable?</font>

188
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:10,042
<font color="yellow">Yes, but I'm busy right now. Let's talk later if it's not urgent.</font>

189
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:11,342
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

190
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,882
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to tell you this,</font>

191
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,042
<font color="yellow">but I think my uncle's ex brother in-law...</font>

192
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,682
<font color="yellow">is going to marry Choi Ji Yun.</font>

193
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:22,382
<font color="yellow">I overheard my uncle's ex mother-in-law...</font>

194
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,112
<font color="yellow">talk about it with my boss.</font>

195
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,682
<font color="yellow">That's none of your business. I'm hanging up.</font>

196
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,312
<font color="yellow">Why is it none of my business?</font>

197
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:30,742
<font color="yellow">If Ji Yun marries someone else,</font>

198
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,682
<font color="yellow">you and I can start dating.</font>

199
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,282
<font color="yellow">Even if Ji Yun marries someone else,</font>

200
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:37,212
<font color="yellow">I don't plan on dating you.</font>

201
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:40,512
<font color="yellow">You're just a close friend. I'm hanging up.</font>

202
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,112
<font color="yellow">Hello? Don't...</font>

203
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:48,582
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

204
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,982
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

205
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:56,482
<font color="yellow">I was out for a meeting and came by for a massage...</font>

206
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,582
<font color="yellow">because I had a headache.</font>

207
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,212
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

208
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,382
<font color="yellow">You don't look happy.</font>

209
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,012
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

210
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,042
<font color="yellow">got rejected.</font>

211
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:11,942
<font color="yellow">By that man you told me about?</font>

212
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:17,042
<font color="yellow">You said his girlfriend dumped him for a rich man.</font>

213
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:18,982
<font color="yellow">Isn't it game over, then?</font>

214
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:20,882
<font color="yellow">He said that...</font>

215
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:24,882
<font color="yellow">even if she leaves him, he won't date me.</font>

216
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:28,112
<font color="yellow">What? How dare a jobless man reject someone like you.</font>

217
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,542
<font color="yellow">He isn't jobless any more. He recently started working.</font>

218
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,542
<font color="yellow">- At your company. - My company?</font>

219
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:35,342
<font color="yellow">What's his name?</font>

220
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,812
<font color="yellow">I'd like to see the face of the jerk who's giving you such a hard time.</font>

221
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,212
<font color="yellow">- What's his name? - Kang Tae Yang.</font>

222
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,282
<font color="yellow">What? Kang Tae Yang?</font>

223
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:47,782
<font color="yellow">- Do you know him? - What?</font>

224
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:50,042
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

225
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:54,582
<font color="yellow">I think I saw him a few times at work.</font>

226
00:13:58,782 --> 00:13:59,842
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

227
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,312
<font color="yellow">He's seeing someone else now?</font>

228
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:07,142
<font color="yellow">I wondered why she looked familiar.</font>

229
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:09,382
<font color="yellow">It was you.</font>

230
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,012
<font color="yellow">I guess there are some things you can't have...</font>

231
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:13,742
<font color="yellow">even if you try your best.</font>

232
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:16,812
<font color="yellow">I constantly tried to win his heart, but he won't budge.</font>

233
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:24,482
<font color="yellow">I think that means he really doesn't care about you.</font>

234
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,712
<font color="yellow">I'm too good for this.</font>

235
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,612
<font color="yellow">I'll find myself a man that's 100 times better than him.</font>

236
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,642
<font color="yellow">Will you really? That's the spirit.</font>

237
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,282
<font color="yellow">I'm so relieved.</font>

238
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,312
<font color="yellow">Why are you relieved?</font>

239
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,282
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

240
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,012
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms Min?</font>

241
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,582
<font color="yellow">She left for a meeting.</font>

242
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:04,642
<font color="yellow">I doubt that. I bet she's at a spa.</font>

243
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:07,042
<font color="yellow">Who would do that during work hours?</font>

244
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,012
<font color="yellow">We'd never dream of it,</font>

245
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,812
<font color="yellow">but she's the chairman's daughter.</font>

246
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,312
<font color="yellow">- She's what? - Didn't you know?</font>

247
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:16,712
<font color="yellow">She's the youngest daughter of the late Chairman Min.</font>

248
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,982
<font color="yellow">Is she really?</font>

249
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:20,742
<font color="yellow">I thought you knew that because the CEO hired you.</font>

250
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:24,182
<font color="yellow">Do you mean Ms Min is CEO Min Hyo Sang's younger sister?</font>

251
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:25,512
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

252
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,812
<font color="yellow">Did something good happen while you were out?</font>

253
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,212
<font color="yellow">You look happy.</font>

254
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:39,312
<font color="yellow">I am. I'm in a great mood today.</font>

255
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:41,682
<font color="yellow">Shall we go out for a team dinner?</font>

256
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:43,082
<font color="yellow">- Really? - A team dinner?</font>

257
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,782
<font color="yellow">Do you have plans, Mr Kang?</font>

258
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,082
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

259
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:54,312
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

260
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:01,882
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

261
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,982
<font color="yellow">The blind date is on again?</font>

262
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:08,142
<font color="yellow">Gwangan Group's chairman's wife changed her mind.</font>

263
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:11,042
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

264
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,312
<font color="yellow">Does she expect my son to show up or not...</font>

265
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,382
<font color="yellow">depending on how she feels?</font>

266
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:18,842
<font color="yellow">What makes her think she has the right to mock us?</font>

267
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,512
<font color="yellow">Calm down and hear me out.</font>

268
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:27,342
<font color="yellow">Miss. Miss, get me some aspirin.</font>

269
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,212
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

270
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:33,582
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

271
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:44,742
<font color="yellow">I know that you feel upset and rightly so,</font>

272
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,842
<font color="yellow">but their daughter...</font>

273
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:50,482
<font color="yellow">seems to have a great interest in your son.</font>

274
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:53,442
<font color="yellow">- She does? - Yes.</font>

275
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:58,442
<font color="yellow">Her mother is reluctant to let her daughter meet your son...</font>

276
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:01,712
<font color="yellow">because of the rumours surrounding your past,</font>

277
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,812
<font color="yellow">but her daughter seems to have met your son...</font>

278
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,782
<font color="yellow">a few times while she was studying abroad.</font>

279
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,282
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

280
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,712
<font color="yellow">I heard that she's had a thing for your son ever since.</font>

281
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,812
<font color="yellow">Things have changed.</font>

282
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:18,742
<font color="yellow">We should leave it up to the young couple.</font>

283
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,842
<font color="yellow">I think it's a done deal, Madam Ko.</font>

284
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,982
<font color="yellow">It's not your place to butt in.</font>

285
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,382
<font color="yellow">Of course, Madam Ko.</font>

286
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:36,382
<font color="yellow">What shall I tell them? Shall I say the date is off?</font>

287
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:42,512
<font color="yellow">If her daughter has a thing for Hyo Sang,</font>

288
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:45,212
<font color="yellow">I'll let her see him just once.</font>

289
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:56,442
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ji Yun.</font>

290
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,442
<font color="yellow">We cancelled a restaurant reservation last time.</font>

291
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,612
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if I should make another one.</font>

292
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,012
<font color="yellow">I'd like that.</font>

293
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:03,942
<font color="yellow">I'll text you the details, then.</font>

294
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:06,082
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you soon.</font>

295
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:11,042
<font color="yellow">She must feel very rushed if she's willing to...</font>

296
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,652
<font color="yellow">make the reservations.</font>

297
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:15,712
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

298
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,982
<font color="yellow">Is the collaboration going well as planned?</font>

299
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,842
<font color="yellow">Yes, their chief designer Mr Moravia...</font>

300
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,942
<font color="yellow">will visit next week, and we're working on the itinerary.</font>

301
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,112
<font color="yellow">What's on so far?</font>

302
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,342
<font color="yellow">On day one, he'll meet you and the executives...</font>

303
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,342
<font color="yellow">to discuss the details of the collaboration.</font>

304
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:42,212
<font color="yellow">On day two, he'll visit our factory...</font>

305
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:45,542
<font color="yellow">and check our production line and the level of our technology.</font>

306
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:49,082
<font color="yellow">On day three, he'll judge the tailoring competition.</font>

<font color="yellow">- He's a judge? - Yes.</font>

308
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:54,382
<font color="yellow">He contacted the Tailor Society and requested...</font>

309
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:56,542
<font color="yellow">to be a judge so he could...</font>

310
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:59,212
<font color="yellow">see for himself how skilled Korean tailors are.</font>

311
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:01,042
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

312
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:03,782
<font color="yellow">- Thanks. - Sure.</font>

314
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:17,312
<font color="yellow">- This is for the preliminary round. - I'll take it.</font>

315
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,442
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Have a nice day.</font>

316
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:27,012
<font color="yellow">Look at this mannequin.</font>

317
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:31,652
<font color="yellow">It has a curved back and the left shoulder's slightly lower.</font>

318
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:36,842
<font color="yellow">The goal is to make a suit for a slightly hunched man.</font>

319
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,742
<font color="yellow">Men who work in front of a computer for long hours have this posture.</font>

320
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,682
<font color="yellow">That means he's a white collar.</font>

321
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:48,782
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, you're a white collar man. Recommend a style.</font>

322
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:52,842
<font color="yellow">The single button is this season's trend, so go with that.</font>

323
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,382
<font color="yellow">Choose a formal colour...</font>

324
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:58,282
<font color="yellow">and a slim fit to accentuate the silhouette.</font>

325
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:00,512
<font color="yellow">Okay, those were valid points.</font>

326
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,182
<font color="yellow">What lapel should we go for?</font>

327
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,182
<font color="yellow">Since it's a slim-fit single-button suit,</font>

328
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,282
<font color="yellow">instead of an aggressive peaked lapel,</font>

329
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,682
<font color="yellow">a formal notched lapel would work better.</font>

330
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,652
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - We could add something to that.</font>

331
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:16,282
<font color="yellow">How about going with striped fabric?</font>

332
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,782
<font color="yellow">I like that. I'm getting some great ideas from all you experts.</font>

333
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:22,712
<font color="yellow">We have the basics, so it's time to design the suit.</font>

334
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:25,742
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil and Ms Geum are better at sewing than I am,</font>

335
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,342
<font color="yellow">- so... - Yun Shil...</font>

336
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,182
<font color="yellow">will do all the sewing for this competition.</font>

337
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:31,652
<font color="yellow">I have to work on our customer's suits.</font>

338
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:34,782
<font color="yellow">- I'll do my best, Master Bae. - Okay, I like that attitude.</font>

339
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:45,152
<font color="yellow">I talked to your father earlier.</font>

340
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,042
<font color="yellow">He said he's doing just fine.</font>

341
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,442
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

342
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,212
<font color="yellow">Shall we get to work?</font>

343
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:53,152
<font color="yellow">- Yun Shil, get the fabric samples. - Yes, Master Bae.</font>

344
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:58,412
<font color="yellow">She was so downcast earlier, but the competition...</font>

345
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:00,412
<font color="yellow">seems to have cheered her up.</font>

346
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:02,112

<font color="yellow">I prayed that I'd be able to...</font>

356
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:38,712
<font color="yellow">see you one last time to tell you that I'm sorry.</font>

357
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,682
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that...</font>

358
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:43,982
<font color="yellow">I managed to meet you while I can still see.</font>

359

364
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,612
<font color="yellow">I called because I miss you.</font>

365

369

<font color="yellow">Oh, right. You have a blind date.</font>

407
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,812
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Why do you look like...</font>

408
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:31,042
<font color="yellow">you're going to a slaughter house?</font>

409

<font color="yellow">No man would like a woman...</font>

414
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,342
<font color="yellow">The blind date.</font>

415
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,042
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

416
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:54,082
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you.</font>

417
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:56,482
<font color="yellow">50 dollars. No.</font>

421
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:09,182
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

422
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:10,782
<font color="yellow">You don't have to date him.</font>

423
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:14,582
<font color="yellow">Just go to the blind date instead of me.</font>

424
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:18,682
<font color="yellow">Just eat the food he buys you.</font>

425
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:21,642
<font color="yellow">It's no big deal.</font>

426
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:26,582
<font color="yellow">Your mother will have a fit if she finds out.</font>

427
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,082
<font color="yellow">How would she know?</font>

428
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:32,342
<font color="yellow">She'll never find out if we both keep our mouths shut.</font>

429
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,212
<font color="yellow">- Well, that's true. - Is it a deal?</font>

430
00:25:40,942 --> 00:25:42,182

<font color="yellow">200 dollars.</font>

432
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:48,812

<font color="yellow">- No. - Apologies.</font>

436
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:45,442
<font color="yellow">- Mr Park Dae Sub? - No.</font>

441
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,112
<font color="yellow">I'll sit back down.</font>

442
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:32,082
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

443
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:34,212
<font color="yellow">the matchmaker told me that...</font>

444
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:37,142
<font color="yellow">- you were tall. - Right.</font>

445
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:39,412
<font color="yellow">She also said that...</font>

446
00:27:39,412 --> 00:27:41,982

<font color="yellow">Most importantly,</font>

448
00:27:45,182 --> 00:27:47,482
<font color="yellow">I was told that you're prettier than...</font>

449
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,882
<font color="yellow">most actresses, and that's why I'm here.</font>

450
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:51,082
<font color="yellow">Don't you think...</font>

451
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,342
<font color="yellow">I look nicer than most actresses?</font>

452
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:57,682
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey</font>

453
00:27:57,882 --> 00:28:01,642
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong with how I look?</font>

454
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:07,782
<font color="yellow">Most actresses would slap themselves when they look at me</font>

455
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,042
<font color="yellow">All that singing made me thirsty.</font>

456
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:13,682
<font color="yellow">I'll order a cold drink.</font>

457
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:16,212
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, can you take my order?</font>

458
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:19,842
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

459
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:22,612
<font color="yellow">Miss.</font>

553
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:14,842
<font color="yellow">You're not money-conscious, are you?</font>

554
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:18,212
<font color="yellow">I guess you like to splurge. I didn't think you'd be like that.</font>

00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:19,942
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

556
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:21,552

570
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:35,942

571
00:36:36,142 --> 00:36:37,712
<font color="yellow">makes the person run away.</font>

572
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,642
<font color="yellow">I hope you don't run away, Miss.</font>

573

581
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:50,082
<font color="yellow">but he couldn't give up the six-dollar discount.</font>

582
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:53,942
<font color="yellow">There's an unexpected side to him.</font>

583
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:17,412

584
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:18,742

593
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:43,812
<font color="yellow">I'm not being nosy. I'm just asking because I just thought of her.</font>

595
00:39:00,282 --> 00:39:01,712

597
00:39:03,312 --> 00:39:04,812

<font color="yellow">Don't contact me directly to ask me out on a second date.</font>

<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

601
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:17,482
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll keep that in mind. Bye now.</font>

602

603
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:23,312
<font color="yellow">The dinner was so delicious,</font>

604
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:26,942

605

<font color="yellow">Who do you think? That weasel.</font>

609
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:40,052
<font color="yellow">That guy who just drove off in his car.</font>

610
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,582
<font color="yellow">Oh, he's Mr Park.</font>

611

612
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,442
<font color="yellow">My acquaintance introduced me to him today for my business.</font>

613
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:50,882
<font color="yellow">He's very different from someone I know. He's well-mannered and kind.</font>

614
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:52,782
<font color="yellow">He certainly has class.</font>

615
00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:56,442
<font color="yellow">Class? Whatever. He looks like a weasel.</font>

616
00:39:57,282 --> 00:39:59,312
<font color="yellow">Looks aren't everything.</font>

617
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:01,212
<font color="yellow">Are you criticising me now?</font>

618
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,742
<font color="yellow">- You got it right. - Tell me the truth. Who is he?</font>

619
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:06,112
<font color="yellow">He's in love with my fried chicken and wants to be my business partner.</font>

620
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,382
<font color="yellow">I met him to discuss business.</font>

621
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:11,982
<font color="yellow">Business? Whatever. You're not cut out for running a business.</font>

622
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,482
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare undermine me.</font>

623
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,282
<font color="yellow">You belittle me all the time because I'm a fish you already caught,</font>

624
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,782
<font color="yellow">but many guys are interested in me. Don't underestimate me.</font>

625
00:40:21,342 --> 00:40:23,182
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. I'm hungry. Let's go in and eat something.</font>

626
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:24,982
<font color="yellow">I thought I made myself clear.</font>

627
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:27,512
<font color="yellow">I'm not cooking for you until you come with me to see my obstetrician.</font>

628
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:31,052
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to be like this? - I'm just copying you.</font>

629
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:32,812
<font color="yellow">Let me make it clear to you.</font>

630
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,782
<font color="yellow">If you want to eat my food,</font>

631
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:37,082
<font color="yellow">you have to come see the doctor with me.</font>

632
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:40,082
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I won't eat your food.</font>

633
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:45,282
<font color="yellow">Bae Sam Do.</font>

634
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:47,812
<font color="yellow">We'll see how long you last.</font>

635
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:56,552
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here? - Just getting some air.</font>

636
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:58,112
<font color="yellow">- Did you eat dinner? - Not yet.</font>

637
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:00,412
<font color="yellow">- Come. I'm ordering jjajangmyeon. - What?</font>

638
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:06,052
<font color="yellow">Jjajangmyeon is such a huge temptation.</font>

639
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:07,382
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

640
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,552
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo.</font>

641
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:19,552
<font color="yellow">- Are you getting home now? - Yes.</font>

642
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:21,182
<font color="yellow">You were with him for a long time.</font>

643
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:24,052
<font color="yellow">Dae Sub got us a bottle of wine for dinner.</font>

644
00:41:24,142 --> 00:41:25,742
<font color="yellow">I had a feast.</font>

645
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:27,982
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

646
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:29,282
<font color="yellow">I think we're in trouble.</font>

647
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:33,112
<font color="yellow">I think he likes me.</font>

648
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:36,212
<font color="yellow">He couldn't take his eyes off of me all night.</font>

649
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:38,382
<font color="yellow">He's totally into me.</font>

650
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:43,482
<font color="yellow">I only went in your place as a favour,</font>

651
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:45,782
<font color="yellow">but what will I do if he asks me out again?</font>

652
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:47,412
<font color="yellow">I have a family.</font>

653
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:50,512
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll take care of it.</font>

654
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:52,912
<font color="yellow">He looked like a nice guy.</font>

655
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,782
<font color="yellow">He's going to be upset when he gets dumped.</font>

656
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,982
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

657
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:01,182
<font color="yellow">Thanks for your help today.</font>

658
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:03,312
<font color="yellow">It was nothing.</font>

659
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,182
<font color="yellow">I got to eat good food and even earned money for it.</font>

660
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:07,442
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

661
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:09,382
<font color="yellow">Why are you smirking?</font>

662
00:42:09,912 --> 00:42:11,052
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

663
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,842
<font color="yellow">- We need to change clothes. - Oh, right.</font>

664
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:16,742
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - That's impossible.</font>

665
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:18,982
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like how she looks?</font>

666
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:21,082
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook...</font>

667
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:23,882
<font color="yellow">is prettier than any girl there is.</font>

668
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:27,442
<font color="yellow">He sure has high standards.</font>

669
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:30,512
<font color="yellow">My goodness, I'm speechless.</font>

670
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:32,682
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

671
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:36,982
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm hanging up for now.</font>

672
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:39,582
<font color="yellow">My daughter just came home.</font>

673
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,112
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to her.</font>

674
00:42:42,412 --> 00:42:43,412
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

675
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,412
<font color="yellow">Did they call?</font>

676
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:48,182
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

677
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:51,182
<font color="yellow">He likes your personality,</font>

678
00:42:51,512 --> 00:42:53,342
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't like how you look.</font>

679
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:54,942
<font color="yellow">He says you're not his style.</font>

680
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,582
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

681
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,882
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my face?</font>

682
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:02,552
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.</font>

683
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:08,812
<font color="yellow">- What is it, Mum? - By any chance,</font>

684
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:12,282
<font color="yellow">did you draw something on your face before going out?</font>

685
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:14,812
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Come on, Mum.</font>

686
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:18,012
<font color="yellow">- I was with him until minutes ago. - My goodness.</font>

687
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:20,052
<font color="yellow">What a strange man.</font>

688
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:22,052
<font color="yellow">I'm not being biased because you're my daughter,</font>

689
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:26,052
<font color="yellow">but you're genuinely a pretty girl. How can he say such a thing?</font>

690
00:43:26,342 --> 00:43:28,282
<font color="yellow">Maybe he already likes someone.</font>

691
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:31,982
<font color="yellow">- They why would he go on a date? - That's what I mean.</font>

692
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:34,982
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What a jerk.</font>

693
00:43:42,582 --> 00:43:44,212
<font color="yellow">Stop humming. Why are you humming?</font>

694
00:43:44,612 --> 00:43:46,712
<font color="yellow">Do I even need your permission to hum?</font>

695
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,482
<font color="yellow">Wake up, you foolish woman.</font>

696
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:54,282
<font color="yellow">I bet that man was trying to get your money.</font>

697
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,212
<font color="yellow">- He just wants to rip you off. - What do you mean?</font>

698
00:43:56,682 --> 00:43:59,082
<font color="yellow">He has two buildings in Jongno. He's a rich guy.</font>

699
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:00,542
<font color="yellow">Rich? No way.</font>

700
00:44:00,982 --> 00:44:02,482
<font color="yellow">He's trying to do business with you...</font>

701
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:03,882
<font color="yellow">because you look like you have money.</font>

702
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:06,212
<font color="yellow">You'll end up losing all your money...</font>

703
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:07,512
<font color="yellow">and getting a divorce.</font>

704
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,142
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

705
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:12,782
<font color="yellow">Mr Park isn't like that.</font>

706
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:13,912
<font color="yellow">Mr Park?</font>

707
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:17,342
<font color="yellow">He cut my meat for me and poured wine, too.</font>

708
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:20,442
<font color="yellow">He was such a gentlemen, I almost cried.</font>

709
00:44:20,442 --> 00:44:23,642
<font color="yellow">That's what those men do. It's their strategy.</font>

710
00:44:23,642 --> 00:44:24,882
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

711
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:26,442
<font color="yellow">If he's nice to me, that's fine.</font>

712
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:29,542
<font color="yellow">Have you gone crazy?</font>

713
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:32,812
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

714
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:34,782
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

715
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:37,212
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, Ms Min, we got to eat great food.</font>

716
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:38,882
<font color="yellow">We had a nice dinner, and also,</font>

717
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:40,842
<font color="yellow">- we're even drinking at a nice bar. - That's right.</font>

718
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:44,342
<font color="yellow">I should have done something like this earlier.</font>

719
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:48,182
<font color="yellow">I just had a lot on my mind,</font>

720
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:49,842
<font color="yellow">so it got delayed.</font>

721
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:51,382
<font color="yellow">Today...</font>

722
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:54,142
<font color="yellow">is for us to build a stronger teamwork,</font>

723
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:57,342
<font color="yellow">while welcoming Mr Kang Tae Yang to the team.</font>

724
00:44:58,342 --> 00:44:59,642
<font color="yellow">Please drink as much as you want.</font>

725
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:01,542
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Cheers.</font>

726
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,112
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Cheers.</font>

727
00:45:17,212 --> 00:45:18,282
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

728
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:27,042
<font color="yellow">Princess Loner seems drunk. Should we stop her?</font>

729
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,212
<font color="yellow">Leave her be. She can control herself.</font>

730
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,212
<font color="yellow">What is Princess Loner?</font>

731
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:35,742
<font color="yellow">That's Ms Min's nickname. She's a princess and a loner.</font>

732
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:38,342
<font color="yellow">Why is she a loner?</font>

733
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:40,782
<font color="yellow">She's always slow and catches things late.</font>

734
00:45:41,182 --> 00:45:43,012
<font color="yellow">- She also acts the way she wants. - I see.</font>

735
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,482
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

736
00:45:50,142 --> 00:45:52,412
<font color="yellow">Since today's a special day,</font>

737
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:55,082
<font color="yellow">we need a special event.</font>

738
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:58,412
<font color="yellow">That's why I prepared something.</font>

739
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:01,182
<font color="yellow">- Ta-da. - What is that?</font>

740
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:03,412
<font color="yellow">- It's a lie detector. - Yes.</font>

741
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:06,542
<font color="yellow">Let's play the truth game.</font>

742
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:08,212
<font color="yellow">- What? - The truth game?</font>

743
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:11,312
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Yang, you're first.</font>

744
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:16,042
<font color="yellow">Put your hand on the machine.</font>

745
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:18,182
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

746
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:20,712
<font color="yellow">Go, go.</font>

747
00:46:23,912 --> 00:46:26,782
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you questions now.</font>

748
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,012
<font color="yellow">Answer them honestly.</font>

749
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,142
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

750
00:46:31,342 --> 00:46:32,882
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

751
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:38,412
<font color="yellow">have a woman that you love right now or not?</font>

752
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:45,312
<font color="yellow">I did, but we broke up recently.</font>

753
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,812
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - My goodness.</font>

754
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:51,142
<font color="yellow">- He's telling the truth. - Gosh.</font>

755
00:46:53,182 --> 00:46:57,812
<font color="yellow">Have you ever cheated on someone?</font>

756
00:46:57,812 --> 00:46:59,942
<font color="yellow">No. Never.</font>

757
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,912
<font color="yellow">- It's the truth. - Wow.</font>

758
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:06,112
<font color="yellow">Then what type of girl...</font>

759
00:47:06,112 --> 00:47:09,382
<font color="yellow">do you want to date?</font>

760
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:11,612
<font color="yellow">A pure person.</font>

761
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:14,082
<font color="yellow">Someone who understands how precious love is.</font>

762
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:17,442
<font color="yellow">- That's so sweet. - That's my ideal woman, too.</font>

763
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,882
<font color="yellow">- Liar. - I'm telling you the truth.</font>

764
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,542
<font color="yellow">- Really? - No way.</font>

765
00:47:23,982 --> 00:47:25,412
<font color="yellow">You're probably like...</font>

766
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:27,982
<font color="yellow">all the other men who look at a girl's background or her looks.</font>

767
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,482
<font color="yellow">I bet you're the same.</font>

768
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:32,542
<font color="yellow">You just know how to sweet talk.</font>

769
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:34,782
<font color="yellow">All men are the same.</font>

770
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:36,512
<font color="yellow">They're all the same.</font>

771
00:47:36,882 --> 00:47:38,582
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree?</font>

772
00:47:40,212 --> 00:47:41,682
<font color="yellow">She's at it again.</font>

773
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:45,782
<font color="yellow">If we're unlucky, we'll be stuck here until 2am.</font>

774
00:47:46,812 --> 00:47:49,512
<font color="yellow">All right, all right. Let's go.</font>

775
00:47:49,612 --> 00:47:50,812
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one more time.</font>

776
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,012
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Yang.</font>

777
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:55,642
<font color="yellow">What is your ideal type?</font>

778
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,582
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to know?</font>

779
00:47:59,582 --> 00:48:00,912
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

780
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,342
<font color="yellow">Why do you think?</font>

781
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:06,082
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure,</font>

782
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:10,382
<font color="yellow">but the important thing is that I'm curious.</font>

783
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:14,112
<font color="yellow">It's fine as long as...</font>

784
00:48:14,512 --> 00:48:15,742
<font color="yellow">it's not someone like you.</font>

785
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:19,812
<font color="yellow">You lied.</font>

786
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:26,742
<font color="yellow">That means your ideal woman...</font>

787
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:29,182
<font color="yellow">is someone like me.</font>

788
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:31,982
<font color="yellow">No way, that doesn't make sense.</font>

789
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,542
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

790
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:37,212
<font color="yellow">This is really amazing.</font>

791
00:48:38,142 --> 00:48:39,512
<font color="yellow">It's a misunderstanding. It's not true.</font>

792
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:41,212
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

793
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:43,112
<font color="yellow">The lie detector just said...</font>

794
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:46,182
<font color="yellow">that your ideal type of woman is me.</font>

795
00:48:48,212 --> 00:48:51,212
<font color="yellow">It seems like you have good taste in women.</font>

796
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:55,842
<font color="yellow">After I'm back from the washroom, we'll have the second round.</font>

797
00:48:56,342 --> 00:48:58,542
<font color="yellow">Round two. Excuse me for a moment.</font>

798
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:05,282
<font color="yellow">This must be fake.</font>

799
00:49:06,482 --> 00:49:07,512
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

800
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:09,582
<font color="yellow">Where did everyone go?</font>

801
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,412
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, we're leaving.</font>

802
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:14,942
<font color="yellow">Make sure you get Princess Loner home safe.</font>

803
00:49:15,612 --> 00:49:17,412
<font color="yellow">That's the job for the youngest.</font>

804
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:19,012
<font color="yellow">Have a good night.</font>

805
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:22,212
<font color="yellow">- That's so cruel. - Let's go to a karaoke room.</font>

806
00:49:39,582 --> 00:49:40,842
<font color="yellow">Where are we?</font>

807
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:42,912
<font color="yellow">I heard the staff are drinking here.</font>

808
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:45,612
<font color="yellow">I came to pick up the tab and join in for a drink.</font>

809
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:48,182
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go.</font>

810
00:49:59,882 --> 00:50:01,082
<font color="yellow">There they are.</font>

811
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,042
<font color="yellow">Where did everyone go?</font>

812
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:14,582
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - I heard your team came here,</font>

813
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:15,842
<font color="yellow">so I dropped by to pay.</font>

814
00:50:16,142 --> 00:50:17,142
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone?</font>

815
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:19,512
<font color="yellow">Everyone else already left,</font>

816
00:50:19,512 --> 00:50:20,982
<font color="yellow">and Ms Min went to the washroom.</font>

817
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:22,612
<font color="yellow">We're going to leave once she returns.</font>

818
00:50:22,612 --> 00:50:24,382
<font color="yellow">I see. Is it okay...</font>

819
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:26,912
<font color="yellow">- if we join you for a while? - Sure.</font>

820
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,212
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to say hello?</font>

821
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:42,942
<font color="yellow">You two have met before.</font>

822
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:47,312
<font color="yellow">Hello. We seem to be running into each other quite often.</font>

823
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,312
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

824
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,112
<font color="yellow">Do you have a girlfriend?</font>

825
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,912
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

826
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:56,282
<font color="yellow">You're a nice guy with good looks.</font>

827
00:50:56,582 --> 00:50:58,282
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you have a girlfriend.</font>

828
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:04,212
<font color="yellow">Your girlfriend must have been happy for you when you got the job.</font>

829
00:51:06,082 --> 00:51:08,342
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking about marrying her?</font>

830
00:51:09,712 --> 00:51:11,212
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the washroom.</font>

831
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:12,342
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

832
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:46,042
<font color="yellow">Look who it is.</font>

833
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:50,742
<font color="yellow">Do announcers come to places like this to drink?</font>

834
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:55,112
<font color="yellow">You hate it when people take pictures of your naked face.</font>

835
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,712
<font color="yellow">Aren't you afraid they'll take pictures of you drinking?</font>

836
00:51:57,712 --> 00:52:00,882
<font color="yellow">I'm not in the mood right now. Don't try me.</font>

837
00:52:01,812 --> 00:52:03,082
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're scaring me.</font>

838
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:06,142
<font color="yellow">Why are you not in the mood today?</font>

839
00:52:07,882 --> 00:52:09,082
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep this up?</font>

840
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:11,712
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing right now?</font>

841
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,042
<font color="yellow">Don't try to start things with me. Do you understand?</font>

842
00:52:15,142 --> 00:52:16,342
<font color="yellow">Why you little...</font>

843
00:52:16,812 --> 00:52:18,612
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. I said let go!</font>

844
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:24,642
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like arguing with someone like you. Get out.</font>

845
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,042
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "someone like me"?</font>

846
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:29,112
<font color="yellow">You're twisted because nothing's going well for you.</font>

847
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:30,712
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

848
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,112
<font color="yellow">- Are you talking about me? - Yes, you.</font>

849
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:37,412
<font color="yellow">That witch...</font>

850
00:52:38,812 --> 00:52:39,842
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

851
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:41,942
<font color="yellow">Get out of there.</font>

852
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:44,082
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

853
00:52:44,082 --> 00:52:47,942
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you off the hook today because I'm drunk.</font>

854
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:50,212
<font color="yellow">I won't go easy on you the next time I see you.</font>

855
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:52,082
<font color="yellow">Consider yourself lucky.</font>

856
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:57,112
<font color="yellow">Today's not my day.</font>

857
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:11,882
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

858
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:17,082
<font color="yellow">Next time, you and your girlfriend...</font>

859
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:19,182
<font color="yellow">should join us two for a meal.</font>

860
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:20,812
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

861
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:27,512
<font color="yellow">I need to see you in front of the washroom.</font>

862
00:53:33,312 --> 00:53:34,712
<font color="yellow">Will you excuse me for a second?</font>

863
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,112
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

864
00:53:48,582 --> 00:53:49,582
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

865
00:53:50,212 --> 00:53:51,312
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

866
00:53:51,512 --> 00:53:53,342
<font color="yellow">Have you been drinking?</font>

867
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:58,142
<font color="yellow">A little bit.</font>

868
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:02,582
<font color="yellow">Where's Tae Yang? Where did he go?</font>

869
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:04,982
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

870
00:54:06,082 --> 00:54:07,182
<font color="yellow">Did he go home?</font>

871
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:09,382
<font color="yellow">Listen to yourself slurring.</font>

872
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:12,512
<font color="yellow">Have you been drinking alone, Hyo Won?</font>

873
00:54:13,112 --> 00:54:14,712
<font color="yellow">Why are you the only one drunk?</font>

874
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:15,912
<font color="yellow">I'm not...</font>

875
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,882
<font color="yellow">drunk at all.</font>

876
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:20,012
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

877
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:23,342
<font color="yellow">You... My goodness. Hey.</font>

878
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:30,042
<font color="yellow">I wish other people could see this.</font>

879
00:54:33,442 --> 00:54:36,382
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's me. Come pick up Hyo Won.</font>

880
00:54:37,142 --> 00:54:38,142
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

881
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:42,982
<font color="yellow">We weren't done playing the truth game.</font>

882
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:45,712
<font color="yellow">Bring me Tae Yang.</font>

883
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:47,782
<font color="yellow">What are you babbling on about?</font>

884
00:54:48,612 --> 00:54:49,712
<font color="yellow">Get yourself together.</font>

885
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:10,012
<font color="yellow">What did you tell Hyo Sang about us?</font>

886
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,082
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell him anything.</font>

887
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:12,312
<font color="yellow">How do you explain this, then?</font>

888
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:15,442
<font color="yellow">This isn't mere coincidence how we keep running into each other.</font>

889
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:18,612
<font color="yellow">Did you really not tell him anything about us?</font>

890
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:20,712
<font color="yellow">Do I look like someone that low?</font>

891
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:23,142
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to get a job there and put me in this spot?</font>

892
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:25,182
<font color="yellow">It's not too late to quit your job.</font>

893
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:27,442
<font color="yellow">You don't care about anyone else other than yourself, do you?</font>

894
00:55:27,712 --> 00:55:28,942
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

895
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:30,212
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang.</font>

896
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:33,682
<font color="yellow">Aren't you afraid your boyfriend might see you here with me?</font>

897
00:55:34,382 --> 00:55:37,782
<font color="yellow">He'll get suspicious if you don't go back.</font>

898
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:40,112
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

899
00:55:53,742 --> 00:55:54,742
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

900
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:58,182
<font color="yellow">- Your son is here. - Is that right?</font>

901
00:55:58,782 --> 00:55:59,912
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

902
00:56:02,982 --> 00:56:05,082
<font color="yellow">I hope you had a great day, my son.</font>

903
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:06,442
<font color="yellow">Where's Hyo Won?</font>

904
00:56:06,982 --> 00:56:10,212
<font color="yellow">I just put her to bed. She was drunk as a skunk.</font>

905
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,942
<font color="yellow">You seem to be in a good mood.</font>

906
00:56:14,782 --> 00:56:17,642
<font color="yellow">I heard from Gwangan Group. They want to arrange a date.</font>

907
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,782
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't feel like it.</font>

908
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:22,282
<font color="yellow">Their daughter says she saw you in New York.</font>

909
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:23,912
<font color="yellow">- She saw me? - Yes.</font>

910
00:56:24,412 --> 00:56:26,112
<font color="yellow">I think she fell for you back then.</font>

911
00:56:27,112 --> 00:56:28,612
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any pride?</font>

912
00:56:30,982 --> 00:56:33,042
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - I thought they refused...</font>

913
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:35,912
<font color="yellow">to arrange a date when they found out you're the second wife.</font>

914
00:56:37,382 --> 00:56:39,212
<font color="yellow">Did you crawl back to them...</font>

915
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:41,082
<font color="yellow">just because they changed their mind?</font>

916
00:56:41,282 --> 00:56:43,742
<font color="yellow">Is that the truth?</font>

917
00:56:45,512 --> 00:56:46,812
<font color="yellow">Well, it is,</font>

918
00:56:47,312 --> 00:56:49,412
<font color="yellow">but they had every right to think that way.</font>

919
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:51,382
<font color="yellow">I can understand that.</font>

920
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:52,942
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

921
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:55,942
<font color="yellow">You can understand that?</font>

922
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:00,982
<font color="yellow">I never heard you saying anything like that.</font>

923
00:57:01,312 --> 00:57:04,382
<font color="yellow">My gosh. How generous of you.</font>

924
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:09,042
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. She's crazy. - How funny.</font>

925
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:12,842
<font color="yellow">Let me make it clear. I'm not going on an arranged date.</font>

926
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:19,882
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang. Don't be upset and just hear me out.</font>

927
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:25,882
<font color="yellow">Are you that jealous...</font>

928
00:57:26,642 --> 00:57:27,712
<font color="yellow">that Hyo Sang might marry a daughter from a wealthy background?</font>

929
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:30,612
<font color="yellow">I told you not to get greedy.</font>

930
00:57:31,312 --> 00:57:33,412
<font color="yellow">I'm just looking out for you.</font>

931
00:57:57,582 --> 00:58:01,942
<font color="yellow">How did she end up with someone like that to be so miserable?</font>

932
00:58:13,942 --> 00:58:15,582
<font color="yellow">Honey?</font>

933
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:21,042
<font color="yellow">- What? - The dress shirts.</font>

934
00:58:21,142 --> 00:58:22,142
<font color="yellow">What about them?</font>

935
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:23,812
<font color="yellow">There aren't any washed ones in the wardrobe.</font>

936
00:58:23,912 --> 00:58:25,312
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that?</font>

937
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,842
<font color="yellow">Should I ask the neighbour about that?</font>

938
00:58:27,942 --> 00:58:30,712
<font color="yellow">I told you. I'm on a strike...</font>

939
00:58:30,712 --> 00:58:32,212
<font color="yellow">until you go to the hospital with me.</font>

940
00:58:32,582 --> 00:58:35,182
<font color="yellow">Is this how you're going to handle the situation?</font>

941
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:39,312
<font color="yellow">You're not being a good husband. Why should I be a good wife?</font>

942
00:58:40,442 --> 00:58:41,442
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

943
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:42,812
<font color="yellow">Who's calling me at this time of the day?</font>

944
00:58:44,882 --> 00:58:45,912
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

945
00:58:45,912 --> 00:58:48,112
<font color="yellow">This is the fried chicken place you got interviewed for.</font>

946

948
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:56,212
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

949
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:59,042
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

950
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,112
<font color="yellow">I'll see you soon.</font>

951
00:59:02,282 --> 00:59:04,842
<font color="yellow">Who was that? It was that guy from yesterday, wasn't it?</font>

952
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:06,882
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

953
00:59:07,182 --> 00:59:08,482
<font color="yellow">Are you being jealous?</font>

954
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:10,142
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

955
00:59:10,142 --> 00:59:12,012
<font color="yellow">Why would I be jealous?</font>

956
00:59:12,112 --> 00:59:14,212
<font color="yellow">Okay. Never mind, then.</font>

957
00:59:18,212 --> 00:59:19,412
<font color="yellow">Is she really cheating on me?</font>

958
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,712
<font color="yellow">No way. No way.</font>

959
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:24,512
<font color="yellow">She's cheating on me?</font>

960
00:59:28,742 --> 00:59:30,182
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Dong Sook.</font>

961
00:59:35,912 --> 00:59:37,982
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'm exercising.</font>

962

963
00:59:41,112 --> 00:59:42,212
<font color="yellow">What do you care?</font>

964
00:59:42,442 --> 00:59:45,912
<font color="yellow">My blind date has nothing to do with you.</font>

965
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,942
<font color="yellow">I know, but I'm just curious.</font>

966
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,482
<font color="yellow">I'm warning you.</font>

967
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:54,442
<font color="yellow">Don't take interest in me...</font>

968
00:59:54,642 --> 00:59:56,282
<font color="yellow">and don't be curious about me, either.</font>

969
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:59,112
<font color="yellow">You're nobody to me, now.</font>

970
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:10,112
<font color="yellow">She's got a point. What do I care if she goes on a date or not?</font>

971
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:14,282
<font color="yellow">You're out early.</font>

972
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:16,412
<font color="yellow">Yes, I have to prepare for the competition.</font>

973

<font color="yellow">Hello, there.</font>

975
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:47,682
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

976
01:00:47,782 --> 01:00:49,212
<font color="yellow">You should come with us.</font>

977
01:00:49,342 --> 01:00:51,912
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo must miss you a lot.</font>

978
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:53,442
<font color="yellow">Let's go pay him a visit.</font>

979
01:00:53,712 --> 01:00:55,012
<font color="yellow">I was going to go on the weekend.</font>

980
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:57,212
<font color="yellow">Can't you see I'm on my way to work?</font>

981
01:00:58,212 --> 01:01:00,812
<font color="yellow">- Let's not do this hard way. - Let go of me.</font>

982
01:01:00,942 --> 01:01:02,212
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

983
01:01:03,582 --> 01:01:05,312
<font color="yellow">I'll go on my own even if I have to.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Where's Yun Shil? - She wasn't home.</font>

987
01:01:27,742 --> 01:01:30,842
<font color="yellow">I thought she had already left. Is she not here yet?</font>

988
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:32,512
<font color="yellow">She must be making a detour.</font>

989
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,012
<font color="yellow">Let me make a phone call.</font>

990
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:54,842
<font color="yellow">People are waiting for me at work. They deserve to know.</font>

991

<font color="yellow">It's going through, but she's not picking up.</font>

992
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,442

<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

1003

<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

1004
01:02:43,582 --> 01:02:44,842
<font color="yellow">It was from Yun Shil.</font>

1005
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:47,512

1006
01:02:47,612 --> 01:02:50,382
<font color="yellow">That's a relief. I thought she got into an accident.</font>

1007
01:02:50,382 --> 01:02:53,682
<font color="yellow">Why didn't she tell us about it? This is so unlike her.</font>

1008
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,982
<font color="yellow">I got so worried. Where is this penitentiary?</font>
