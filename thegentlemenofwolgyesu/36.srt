17
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,785
<font color="yellow">The moment Gi Pyo comes out of the prison,</font>

18

<font color="yellow">he would harm Dong Jin.</font>

19

<font color="yellow">What good would come to my son?</font>

24
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:17,125
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin is meant to be a great man. You would just drag my son down.</font>

25
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:22,285
<font color="yellow">He is as precious as my own life to me.</font>

26

33
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:53,855

38
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,125
<font color="yellow">I called her to make her understood.</font>

39

<font color="yellow">Don't just object her. Think about it carefully.</font>

40
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,655
<font color="yellow">You should think about...</font>

41
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,585

00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,125

<font color="yellow">is hard to find nowadays.</font>

45
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:07,955
<font color="yellow">We have seen her in our own backyard so far.</font>

46
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,485
<font color="yellow">This happened because of you.</font>

47
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:14,585
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't left home.</font>

48
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:18,425
<font color="yellow">Then Dong Jin wouldn't have to work at the tailor shop,</font>

49
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:20,785
<font color="yellow">and he would have never met Yun Shil.</font>

50
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:25,655
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to leave home and create this mess?</font>

51
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:30,025
<font color="yellow">I understand how much you're upset,</font>

52
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:33,955
<font color="yellow">but don't be so pessimistic about it.</font>

53
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,285
<font color="yellow">To meet a woman who gets along well with you, have children...</font>

54
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,825
<font color="yellow">and live happily together, that's a good life.</font>

55
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:42,085
<font color="yellow">You have lived your own life up to now.</font>

56
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:43,725
<font color="yellow">What is a life about?</font>

57
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,885
<font color="yellow">If you're going to keep saying those things, just leave home again.</font>

61
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:57,385
<font color="yellow">Do you think I feel comfortable when I treat Yun Shil hard?</font>

62
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,925

63
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:04,055
<font color="yellow">So you would better keep quiet this time.</font>

64
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,455

<font color="yellow">Why are you being so humble today?</font>

108
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,125

00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,755
<font color="yellow">Did you argue with your friend?</font>

115
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:02,725
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

116
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,655
<font color="yellow">Then is something wrong?</font>

117
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,185
<font color="yellow">We promised to discuss things...</font>

118

119
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:15,925

122
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,095
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid...</font>

123
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,685

132
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:10,885
<font color="yellow">I wonder how.</font>

133

<font color="yellow">Yes! Your head, please.</font>

313
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,085
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won,</font>

<font color="yellow">Where's mum? Is she already in bed?</font>

322
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:22,155
<font color="yellow">Madam Ko tagged along on Miss Hyo Won's date.</font>

323
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:29,755
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with my mum these days, seriously?</font>

324
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,085
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

325
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:38,155
<font color="yellow">Is she with Tae Yang right now?</font>

326
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,885

00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,385

<font color="yellow">We should take her to her bed.</font>

337
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:09,225
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:34,325
<font color="yellow">Mum, are you in your right mind?</font>

345
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,425
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind or what?</font>

346
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,285
<font color="yellow">You can't go out dressed like that.</font>

347
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:41,255
<font color="yellow">What if you run into people from work?</font>

348
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:43,485
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, you brat.</font>

349
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:46,755
<font color="yellow">You embarrassed me in front of Ji Yun.</font>

350
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,485
<font color="yellow">She saw you dressed like this.</font>

351
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:51,255
<font color="yellow">She'll probably think that our family is a big joke.</font>

352
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:53,525
<font color="yellow">I give Ji Yun...</font>

353
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:55,685
<font color="yellow">30 out of 100.</font>

354
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:59,485
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang gets 90 out of 100.</font>

355
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,425
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

356
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:04,755
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm cold.</font>

357
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:06,325
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

358
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,485
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to do this?</font>

359
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,185
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

360
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:18,325
<font color="yellow">You approached Hyo Won and even charmed her mum on purpose.</font>

361
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:22,955
<font color="yellow">I had no idea that you could be this calculative and vindictive.</font>

362
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:25,655
<font color="yellow">You probably think everyone is like you.</font>

363
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:27,655
<font color="yellow">- What? - The word "approach"...</font>

364
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,485
<font color="yellow">isn't appropriate to describe human relationships.</font>

365
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:32,525
<font color="yellow">People exchange feelings...</font>

366
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,785
<font color="yellow">and become close step by step with time.</font>

367
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,985
<font color="yellow">Unlike you, most people don't abandon everything for their goals.</font>

368
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:40,725
<font color="yellow">You have to open up to people and be yourself in relationships.</font>

369
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:43,425
<font color="yellow">Are you lecturing me right now?</font>

370
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:46,585
<font color="yellow">You're probably all full of yourself right now...</font>

371
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,525
<font color="yellow">because Hyo Won likes you,</font>

372
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,325
<font color="yellow">but you better come to your senses.</font>

373
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,025
<font color="yellow">Do you think this family will allow you to marry her?</font>

374
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:58,655
<font color="yellow">The women in this household drive me crazy.</font>

375
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,125
<font color="yellow">Darling.</font>

376
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,425
<font color="yellow">The two of you haven't officially met, right?</font>

377
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:10,085
<font color="yellow">This is my brother's girlfriend, Announcer Choi Ji Yun.</font>

378
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:13,125
<font color="yellow">This my boyfriend who is also my best friend...</font>

379
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:15,385
<font color="yellow">and future husband, Kang Tae Yang.</font>

380
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:19,685
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm in a foul mood right now.</font>

381
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:29,755
<font color="yellow">As we have experienced with Dong Sook,</font>

382
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:33,685
<font color="yellow">we can't have our way when it comes to our children.</font>

383
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,285
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

384
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:36,825
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

385
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,155
<font color="yellow">They say that bad things happen all at once.</font>

386
00:27:39,855 --> 00:27:43,025
<font color="yellow">I was so stressed out over Dong Sook's marriage...</font>

387
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:45,725
<font color="yellow">and now Dong Jin's giving me a hard time.</font>

388
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:48,255
<font color="yellow">It depends on how you see it.</font>

389
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,385
<font color="yellow">It could be better for Dong Jin...</font>

390
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:53,955
<font color="yellow">to remarry and have kids...</font>

391
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,285
<font color="yellow">than to live and die alone.</font>

392
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:02,885
<font color="yellow">It depends on who he marries.</font>

393
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:04,355
<font color="yellow">May we come in?</font>

394
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,725
<font color="yellow">Are you sick, Mum?</font>

395
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,485
<font color="yellow">Lunch didn't agree with her.</font>

396
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,755
<font color="yellow">Should she see a doctor?</font>

397
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,625
<font color="yellow">Or should I run to the pharmacy?</font>

398
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:24,085
<font color="yellow">She'll be fine. She took some medicine.</font>

399
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:28,325
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo bought you a cake.</font>

400
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:31,785
<font color="yellow">Dad, come and have some.</font>

401
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,455
<font color="yellow">No thanks. You go ahead.</font>

402
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,755
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Goodnight.</font>

403
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,355
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

404
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,785
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin was the smartest boy in his class...</font>

405
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,825
<font color="yellow">and he always got good grades.</font>

406
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:57,425
<font color="yellow">Why is he such a terrible judge when it comes to women?</font>

407
00:28:58,025 --> 00:28:59,455
<font color="yellow">He got that from me.</font>

408
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:00,955
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

409
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,925
<font color="yellow">I cracked a joke to make you laugh.</font>

410
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:08,225
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you aren't bothered at all.</font>

411
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:10,985
<font color="yellow">How could you make jokes at a time like this?</font>

412
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,225
<font color="yellow">Mum, do you think Grandma...</font>

413
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:27,485
<font color="yellow">found out about Uncle and Yun Shil?</font>

414
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,185
<font color="yellow">Did you tell her?</font>

415
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:31,725
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

416
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,555
<font color="yellow">Then did Father tell her?</font>

417
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,225
<font color="yellow">He said he wouldn't for a while.</font>

418
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,825
<font color="yellow">Let's drink and be merry, then.</font>

419
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:45,555
<font color="yellow">Lift your glass, Miss.</font>

420
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,685
<font color="yellow">You can't call me that now.</font>

421
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,355
<font color="yellow">Now you should...</font>

422
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,885
<font color="yellow">call me by my name, Dad.</font>

423
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:56,285
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

424
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:58,855
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to be my dad?</font>

425
00:30:01,855 --> 00:30:02,985
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

426
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:04,955
<font color="yellow">I was so touched.</font>

427
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:08,785
<font color="yellow">Thanks for calling me "dad".</font>

428
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:10,985
<font color="yellow">Sure, Dad.</font>

429
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:15,525
<font color="yellow">I lack in so many ways to be a deserving dad,</font>

430
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:17,185
<font color="yellow">but I'll work hard...</font>

431
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:20,625

<font color="yellow">Thank you, Jun.</font>

433
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:27,485

434
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,655
<font color="yellow">You need to address him properly.</font>

435

00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:34,355

00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:09,855
<font color="yellow">- Why did you say yes to that? - Why not?</font>

761
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,125
<font color="yellow">We're on Dong Jin and Yun Shil's side.</font>

763
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:17,785

764
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,485
<font color="yellow">- What? - Let's be honest.</font>

765
00:52:20,655 --> 00:52:24,185
<font color="yellow">Do you really think that she's good enough for Dong Jin?</font>

766
00:52:25,085 --> 00:52:26,255
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Dong Sook.</font>

00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,385
<font color="yellow">I do like Yun Shil,</font>

768

<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't allow it.</font>

770
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:39,855
<font color="yellow">She sounds just like her mum when she says things like that.</font>
