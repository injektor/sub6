<font color="yellow">I have something to ask.</font>

103

<font color="yellow">♬<i>On the petals floating in the wind</i>♬</font>

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:39,350
<font color="yellow">♬<i>I sense your warm frangrance and</i>♬</font>

150
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,850
<font color="yellow">♬<i>our connection which was brief </i>♬</font>

151
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,070
<font color="yellow">Those two... live happily.</font>

152
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,970
<font color="yellow">Doesn't get sick or hurt.</font>

153
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,510
<font color="yellow">Having lots of kids and raising them well.</font>

154
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,260
<font color="yellow">Happily ever after</font>

155
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,870
<font color="yellow">they grow old together.</font>

156
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,490
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

157
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, they did.</font>

158
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,360
<font color="yellow">That's their story that I saw.</font>

159
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,250
<font color="yellow">♬<i>I won't let go of your hand.</i>♬</font>

160
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,050
<font color="yellow">But why</font>

161
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,480
<font color="yellow">am I tearing up?</font>

162
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,520
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

163
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,660
<font color="yellow">They must have seen us in their dreams, too.</font>

164
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,640
<font color="yellow">Then why is it a scary dream?</font>

165
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,690
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

166
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,500
<font color="yellow">It's a beautiful dream.</font>

167
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,470
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

168
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,180
<font color="yellow">You're scared that a beautiful dream is repeating?</font>

169
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,550
<font color="yellow">Hey. You can't be so loud here.</font>

170
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,800
<font color="yellow">It bothers other people.</font>

171
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,760
<font color="yellow">What other people?</font>

172
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,190
<font color="yellow">Why? What are you scared of?</font>

173
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,320
<font color="yellow">It's just that we're in a different situation than back then.</font>

174
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,490
<font color="yellow">What's different?</font>

175
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,250
<font color="yellow">You said so. If you stay here,</font>

176
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,620
<font color="yellow">you might die.</font>

177
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,240
<font color="yellow">If you stay by me and love me, my heart will keep beating on.</font>

178
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,380
<font color="yellow">Probably the same for them too, since they lived happily ever after.</font>

179
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,060
<font color="yellow">I'm not that man.</font>

180
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,630
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

181
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,440
<font color="yellow">I'm saying I can't be sure of my heart.</font>

182
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,140
<font color="yellow">The easiest thing that can change in the world is a person's heart.</font>

183
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,810
<font color="yellow">That's why those lovey dovey couples break up,</font>

184
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,010
<font color="yellow">and the marriage that seemed to last forever ends, too.</font>

185
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,640
<font color="yellow">Knowing that your life depends on my heart which I don't even know—</font>

186
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,350
<font color="yellow">- So you're scared? <br> - Yeah.</font>

187
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,320
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of that.</font>

188
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,830
<font color="yellow">- What? <br> - It's not fair.</font>

189
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,250
<font color="yellow">How come you can hear my heart, but I can't hear yours?</font>

190
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,820
<font color="yellow">Why do you need to hear my heart?</font>

191
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,220
<font color="yellow">From a person who only tells the truth.</font>

192
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,760
<font color="yellow">Don't swear. I can hear it all.</font>

193
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,780
<font color="yellow"><i>[Chief Nam's wife; 011-837-9238]</i></font>

194
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,230
<font color="yellow"><i>The number you have dialed is not available.</i></font>

195
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,900
<font color="yellow">I have a good idea. Let's do this, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

196
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,650
<font color="yellow">Hmm?</font>

197
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,730
<font color="yellow">I'd hate to have you feel burdensome or scared because of me.</font>

198
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,320
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

199
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,350
<font color="yellow">Let's just erase yesterday. Just yesterday.</font>

200
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,230
<font color="yellow">- What? <br> - If we just erase yesterday fro your brain,</font>

201
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,920
<font color="yellow">we can go back to how we used to be. You won't feel burdensome and stuff.</font>

202
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

203
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,640
<font color="yellow">I can do it. If I just control my strength well...</font>

204
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,810
<font color="yellow">I think I can get it to work.</font>

205
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,330
<font color="yellow">Get what to work?</font>

206
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,920
<font color="yellow">It's not that easy in the water, and I'm a little short on stamina since I've been on land for so long.</font>

207
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,500
<font color="yellow">But I'll try my best, hmm? Now a lot but just a little.</font>

208
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,700
<font color="yellow">I'd say maybe a day or half a day.</font>

209
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,780
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

210
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,120
<font color="yellow">Just close your eyes and bear with me.</font>

211
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,140
<font color="yellow">Why close my eyes?!</font>

212
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,120
<font color="yellow">- It won't hurt. Just a sec. <br> - Hey, don't push! What are you doing?</font>

213
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,750
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't come near me! What are you doing?</font>

214
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,660
<font color="yellow">It won't hurt. Just trust me,</font>

215
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,210
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

216
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,980
<font color="yellow">Jeez! What's with you!</font>

217
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,130
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

218
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait. Wait up. Wait!</font>

219
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,770
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

220
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,540
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

221
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,330
<font color="yellow">Stop, really.</font>

222
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are those guys doing? Are they playing catch me if you can now?</font>

223
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,270
<font color="yellow">Yesterday she was crying like no tomorrow, the ground collapsed and she was heaving and crying up a storm.</font>

224
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,200
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

225
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,230
<font color="yellow">I hope the day clears up soon so I don't have to see all these ridiculous things and take off.</font>

226
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,460
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

227
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,140
<font color="yellow">I think I just have to erase half a day.</font>

228
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,410
<font color="yellow">Can't I?</font>

229
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,010
<font color="yellow">Close the door.</font>

230
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,910
<font color="yellow">It would be great if I could just erase half the day.</font>

231
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,240
<font color="yellow">Would erasing the day make it so that nothing happened?</font>

232
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,680
<font color="yellow">I told you. What if I change my heart and don't like you anymore?</font>

233
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,820
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae I'm a mermaid with a great amount of insight on people. Do you think that I would've come this far to follow some man that switches his mind so quickly?</font>

234
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,630
<font color="yellow">I knew it the moment I saw you. "This is the man"</font>

235
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,930
<font color="yellow">Someone who's worth hanging my once in a lifetime love on.</font>

236
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,640
<font color="yellow">You said that there was something wrong with your eyes.</font>

237
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,380
<font color="yellow">What? <br> - There was something wrong with my eyes. I was so naive back then.</font>

238
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,290
<font color="yellow">I lived my entire life in the water and it's the first time I've come upon land what do I know? Being that Heo Joon Jae was the first man I encountered</font>

239
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,150
<font color="yellow">You said you came here thinking I was the best.</font>

240
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,550
<font color="yellow">You thought I was the only handsome guy in the world,</font>

241
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,830
<font color="yellow">When I look at the TV there's so many. Such a patient suffering from Prince Syndrome.</font>

242
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,570
<font color="yellow">You said it I was too into myself!</font>

243
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,070
<font color="yellow">So you heard it all? You can think anything when you're mad.</font>

244
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,310
<font color="yellow">It's that you're a bit narrow hearted to pretend you didn't hear anything when you heard everything.</font>

245
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,480
<font color="yellow">Ok, then. How about we erase all that as well?</font>

246
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,520
<font color="yellow">You heard me talking behind your back, how cheap of you.</font>

247
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,000
<font color="yellow">I think we'd be good if we erase about one week.</font>

248
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,410
<font color="yellow">Now that we're on the subject do you want to go to the East Sea?</font>

249
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,250
<font color="yellow">Or should I get you a plane ticket to go somewhere? Like Boracay?</font>

250
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,880
<font color="yellow">That ocean must be nice and warm. I'll visit you time to time. I can see you when I'm surfing and stuff.</font>

251
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,670
<font color="yellow">Fine. I won't do anything to you. Let's just sleep holding hands.</font>

252
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,910
<font color="yellow">I'm serious. I won't do anything. I'll just sleep holding your hand. Don't you trust me?</font>

253
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,170
<font color="yellow">Totally not.</font>

254
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,860
<font color="yellow"><i>He's not falling for it.</i></font>

255
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,400
<font color="yellow">I can hear all that. You're doing so well for yourself.</font>

256
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,010
<font color="yellow">You're a mermaid that's supposed to be innocent and ignorant, but you're so vulgar and base, even lying!</font>

257
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,250
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you to go read some fairytales in your spare time. Among your ancestors there wasn't anyone who's as much of a playgirl as you!</font>

258
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,150
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

259
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,720
<font color="yellow">You sure you won't do anything to me?</font>

260
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,980
<font color="yellow">Nope. I promise.</font>

261
00:22:53,030 --> 00:23:00,320
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything. I'll just check if your heart is doing okay.</font>

262
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,030
<font color="yellow">It's beating well.</font>

263
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,160
<font color="yellow">It beats well by you.</font>

264
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,410
<font color="yellow">What? She was their household helper?</font>

265
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,440
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

266
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,980
<font color="yellow">I was wondering where she was hiding...</font>

267
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,590
<font color="yellow">No wonder I couldn't fine her since she was a resident helper.</font>

268
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,830
<font color="yellow"><i>What's wrong? You don't like it?</i></font>

269
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,310
<font color="yellow"><i>No, it's good. You should try, too.</i></font>

270
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,070
<font color="yellow">Go to that house right now.</font>

271
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,340
<font color="yellow">Oh, Madam, you really surprised me.</font>

272
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,600
<font color="yellow">What brings you here so suddenly?</font>

273
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,940
<font color="yellow">You know you've been contacting me but I couldn't get back to you.</font>

274
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,110
<font color="yellow">- Please have a seat. <br> - Okay.</font>

275
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,090
<font color="yellow">Then... that incident that day...</font>

276
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,010
<font color="yellow">are you going to magnanimously pass on it?</font>

277
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,720
<font color="yellow">Of course. Anybody could be like that when they're drunk.</font>

278
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,380
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

279
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,320
<font color="yellow">Can I stay for some tea?</font>

280
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,770
<font color="yellow">Of course. Is coffee okay with you?</font>

281
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

282
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:49,810
<font color="yellow">Ahjumma! Bring us 2 delicious cups of coffee please!</font>

283
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,470
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

284
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,270
<font color="yellow">She's the one that's making us the side dishes, right?</font>

285
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:04,490
<font color="yellow">Yes. You said the Chairman really liked them.</font>

286
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,490
<font color="yellow">What can be done? She said that she's going to quit.</font>

287
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,610
<font color="yellow">Quitting?</font>

288
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,940
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's such a good worker,</font>

289
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,280
<font color="yellow">she must have got an offer from somewhere else or something.</font>

290
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,190
<font color="yellow">She suddenly told me that she's quitting.</font>

291
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,420
<font color="yellow">Ahjumma, what are you doing?</font>

292
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,000
<font color="yellow">Ajumma your cooking skills are so superb.</font>

293
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,790
<font color="yellow">We've really been enjoying your food.</font>

294
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,370
<font color="yellow">I heard you're quitting.</font>

295
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:10,880
<font color="yellow">Have you decided where to go? If not, how about my house?</font>

296
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,240
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

297
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,060
<font color="yellow">Can I go to your place?</font>

298
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,390
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Ahjumma, are you drunk? W-what are you doing?</font>

299
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,700
<font color="yellow">Can I cook at your house?</font>

300
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,320
<font color="yellow">You won't give up the master bedroom but the kitchen's okay?</font>

301
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,070
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you're here or what you want to verify.</font>

302
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,840
<font color="yellow">You're wrong.</font>

303
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,520
<font color="yellow">The reason that I was living as if I were dead</font>

304
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,990
<font color="yellow">is because harm might come to our Joon Jae.</font>

305
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,380
<font color="yellow">Now I have nothing to stop me.</font>

306
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
<font color="yellow">Jin Joo.</font>

307
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,560
<font color="yellow">Please excuse us for a second.</font>

308
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,740
<font color="yellow">- Of course. <br> - You told me once</font>

309
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,650
<font color="yellow">there is a bitch who stole a friend's husband and took her place.</font>

310
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:18,240
<font color="yellow">You didn't know where the original wife who got kicked out is.</font>

311
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,380
<font color="yellow">Did I... speak so... crudely?</font>

312
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,930
<font color="yellow">Did I?</font>

313
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,040
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

314
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,410
<font color="yellow">That original wife who got kicked out.</font>

315
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,350
<font color="yellow">And this person is</font>

316
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,640
<font color="yellow">that mean-hearted bitch.</font>

317
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,230
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

318
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
<font color="yellow">Yein's mom</font>

319
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,090
<font color="yellow">What a great happening so early in the year!
subtitles ripped,synced and added the missing lines by riri13</font>

320
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,550
<font color="yellow">You know you know. Our house is the site of history!</font>

321
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,440
<font color="yellow">I think it's going to be the site of history.</font>

322
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,840
<font color="yellow">Get ready to be swept off your feet and listen carefully.</font>

323
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,030
<font color="yellow">Hyung did you look into finding that Kang Ji Young I told you about before?</font>

324
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,590
<font color="yellow">Yeah I did try looking</font>

325
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,890
<font color="yellow">I never had ever doe any investigation as goose-bump worthy as this one.</font>

326
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,080
<font color="yellow">The people and things surrounding this woman are all suspicious.</font>

327
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,840
<font color="yellow">She married twice and both of her husbands both died.</font>

328
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,730
<font color="yellow">But there's alibi, diagnosis, so after their death Kang Ji Hyeon won the entirety of the insurance</font>

329
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,670
<font color="yellow">But that's not all</font>

330
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,990
<font color="yellow">this woman is an orphan so she was adopted, but the family that she was adopted into all of the family members</font>

331
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,570
<font color="yellow">are all nowhere to be found.</font>

332
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,360
<font color="yellow">Are you real?</font>

333
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,900
<font color="yellow">We just got goosebumps.</font>

334
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,850
<font color="yellow">So what about now? Where is she?</font>

335
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,010
<font color="yellow">We cannot know her current whereabouts at all.</font>

336
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,860
<font color="yellow">But if it's a woman of her class, I'm thinking she's probably living under a different identity. What do you think?</font>

337
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,360
<font color="yellow">But the thing is, there's another astonishing fact</font>

338
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,430
<font color="yellow">Stop leaking the info piece by piece but reveal it all in one go.</font>

339
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,660
<font color="yellow">I have to do it like this for there to be a thrill.</font>

340
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,760
<font color="yellow">This Kang Ji Hyun is from Jecheon.</font>

341
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,450
<font color="yellow">I kept wondering where the hell I kept seeing her high school name,</font>

342
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,630
<font color="yellow">but it was from during the time that I looked for your mother. She was from the same high school.</font>

343
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Graduation Certificate<br> - Daneon Girls' High School Hong Yeong Jik</i></font>

344
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:14,720
<font color="yellow">Honey, this is your secretary who came in place of Mr. Nam.</font>

345
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,090
<font color="yellow">Chairman, I'll do my best [to assist you].</font>

346
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,730
<font color="yellow">Goodness, it's me who has to rely on your effort.</font>

347
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,270
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll start the car.</font>

348
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,840
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

349
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,030
<font color="yellow">My gosh, never you mind. I'll do it.</font>

350
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,440
<font color="yellow">Please take a seat.</font>

351
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,150
<font color="yellow">Missus, I was really sorry today.</font>

352
00:30:54,150 --> 00:31:00,250
<font color="yellow">I realize that you still haven't found the new person,<br>but I'd like to quit after setting up dinner tonight.</font>

353
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,130
<font color="yellow">Unni (Big sis).</font>

354
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,060
<font color="yellow">Wh-a-a...?</font>

355
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,190
<font color="yellow">You would be a big sis whether you look at it from the age<br>or whatever else...</font>

356
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,520
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have an older biological sister, and...</font>

357
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,320
<font color="yellow">from now on, I'll think on you as my biological sister.</font>

358
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,050
<font color="yellow">Missus.</font>

359
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,380
<font color="yellow">You don't have to work. That's right. However, if you were to leave here,</font>

360
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,860
<font color="yellow">it's not like you have a suitable place to go to,</font>

361
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,280
<font color="yellow">so just pretend like this is your biological younger sister's home,</font>

362
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,040
<font color="yellow">and stay on comfortably.</font>

363
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,690
<font color="yellow">How can I?</font>

364
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:42,020
<font color="yellow">Unni! I really thought I was watching...a great historical drama!</font>

365
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:48,680
<font color="yellow">You were the Queen Consort Yin Hyeon, and Gang Seol<br>that wench is Hi Bin Jang (famous royal concubine).</font>

366
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:57,120
<font color="yellow">However the important thing is that the Queen Consort<br>Yin Hyeon eventually return to her own place.</font>

367
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,140
<font color="yellow">Me, Ahn Jin Joo is going to help that.</font>

368
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,470
<font color="yellow">Your brilliant return to the Queen Consort position.</font>

369
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,670
<font color="yellow">I have no intent to do so.</font>

370
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:17,220
<font color="yellow">No, no. Even if you don't have any intention, you should do it,<br>least of all for me.</font>

371
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:25,060
<font color="yellow">Whatever it may, I will help you Unni, and will never let you<br>leave as is.</font>

372
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,710
<font color="yellow">Please just know that.</font>

373
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,840
<font color="yellow">Agassi (sister-in-law of the husband),</font>

374
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
<font color="yellow">you knew all along, didn't you?</font>

375
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,800
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you were groveling to Ajumma recently?</font>

376
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,730
<font color="yellow">What could you mean?</font>

377
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:44,330
<font color="yellow">You knew our ajumma was the Chairman Heo Il Joong's<br>Jo Gang Ji Cheo (wife through sickness in health)!</font>

378
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

379
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,420
<font color="yellow">You mean you had not an inkling?</font>

380
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,190
<font color="yellow">Wh-a-t in the world are you talking...?</font>

381
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,460
<font color="yellow">I can't even count the number of times I told this story.</font>

382
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,360
<font color="yellow">But no matter how many iterations I run through,<br>my heart still beats this wildly.</font>

383
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,400
<font color="yellow">You know our ajumma was the original wife of Heo Il Joong Chairman!</font>

384
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,090
<font color="yellow">But without having any idea, I've been supplying the food<br>Ajumma has cooked to that house!</font>

385
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,490
<font color="yellow">Isn't it so dramatic?</font>

386
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,980
<font color="yellow">Then Joon Jae is...</font>

387
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,520
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae? You know that household's son?</font>

388
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,490
<font color="yellow">Not so. How would I know that? It's just my friend's name.</font>

389
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,920
<font color="yellow">But seriously, that son who ran away from home,</font>

390
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,690
<font color="yellow">that son's name must be Heo Joon Jae.</font>

391
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,690
<font color="yellow">A little while ago, Ajumma was uttering something about<br>Joon Jae or something.</font>

392
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,070
<font color="yellow">Yes, Noona (older sister a male calls a female).</font>

393
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,820
<font color="yellow">Were you awaiting my call?</font>

394
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,470
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, how does one pick up a phone even before it rings?</font>

395
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,090
<font color="yellow">It's not that, but I was gaming...</font>

396
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,670
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Listen without getting all fluttered.</font>

397
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,000
<font color="yellow">Will you come to pick me up?</font>

398
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,490
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

399
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,150
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy? That's right. Now.</font>

400
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,560
<font color="yellow">But you can't have and ulterior motive, alright?</font>

401
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,330
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

402
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,140
<font color="yellow">Si Ah Noona asked me to come to the club.</font>

403
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,910
<font color="yellow">Really? Is that a place with good water (atmosphere of the club)?</font>

404
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,190
<font color="yellow">Is that a place with fresh water (literally good quality water to swim in)? I want to go, too.</font>

405
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,760
<font color="yellow">- You'd go too?<br>- Yeah.</font>

406
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,370
<font color="yellow">What? How dare you...</font>

407
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,520
<font color="yellow">What? What? I'm not usually the one gets flagged.</font>

408
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,970
<font color="yellow">It's not that but your attire is somewhat...</font>

409
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,130
<font color="yellow">Ah... Cheong.</font>

410
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,530
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

411
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,120
<font color="yellow">Wow, today is Swag-Cheong! Let's go!</font>

412
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,330
<font color="yellow">Cha Si Ah!</font>

413
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,130
<font color="yellow">I told you to come alone, so why drag the unwanted?</font>

414
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,670
<font color="yellow">Cha Si Ah, were you coming to such a nice place alone?</font>

415
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:46,130
<font color="yellow">Cha Si Ah, don't drink. Last time when I saw Heo Joon Jae<br>drink, he became a little cuter.</font>

416
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,910
<font color="yellow">It depends on a person. In case of Cha Si Ah, she always<br>call and cries,</font>

417
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,290
<font color="yellow">and prohibits you from hanging up on her all night, and...</font>

418
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,100
<font color="yellow">I got it. I'm hitting the dance floor.</font>

419
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a safe guy.</font>

420
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,620
<font color="yellow">As there are so many unsavory incidents, that my hands<br>are always up above.</font>

421
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,890
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about a thing, and just dance. Just dance.</font>

422
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,780
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are so pretty.</font>

423
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, what?</font>

424
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,330
<font color="yellow">Where is everyone?</font>

425
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:41,000
<font color="yellow">Ah, Detective Heo. Have you returned from your investigation?<br>We're at a club.</font>

426
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,660
<font color="yellow">- What about Cheong?<br>- Of course she came together.</font>

427
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,480
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring her there?</font>

428
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,330
<font color="yellow">She'll say she's dizzy and won't like it.</font>

429
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,650
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? She's moving through space fluidly.<br>She's completely at home here.</font>

430
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

431
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,170
<font color="yellow">Please move over.</font>

432
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,600
<font color="yellow">Hey Joon Jae, what brings you here?</font>

433
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,400
<font color="yellow">Um. Just because...</font>

434
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,060
<font color="yellow">Let's play. It's really fun here.</font>

435
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,610
<font color="yellow">I'd like to but I still have things to do.</font>

436
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,770
<font color="yellow">Have fun with Nam Doo hyung (older brother) & Tae Ho.</font>

437
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,890
<font color="yellow">Make sure you ask to be taken home when you're done.</font>

438
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,840
<font color="yellow">You come here. Stop.</font>

439
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,740
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae!</font>

440
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,690
<font color="yellow">Why? I'm going to dance some more.</font>

441
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,930
<font color="yellow">Are you sweating?</font>

442
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,660
<font color="yellow">Yep. The dancing is making me a little warm.<br>But I like it!</font>

443
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,010
<font color="yellow">I bet you like it, alright. Come one out.</font>

444
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,680
<font color="yellow">Why? I'm going to dance some more.</font>

445
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,500
<font color="yellow">Right. Come here.</font>

446
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,510
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

447
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,100
<font color="yellow">It's raining a lot.</font>

448
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,650
<font color="yellow">This turns out to be one of the things I cannot do together with you.</font>

449
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,740
<font color="yellow">Walking when it's raining.</font>

450
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,800
<font color="yellow">You know I can't.</font>

451
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,800
<font color="yellow">There's nothing you can't do. Wait a minute here.</font>

452
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,500
<font color="yellow">one step closer</font>

453
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,440
<font color="yellow">Where did you find this?</font>

454
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,470
<font color="yellow">Don't say I won't or I can't from now on.</font>

455
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:05,510
<font color="yellow">I will let you do every single thing people who live here do<br>without leaving anything out.</font>

456
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,190
<font color="yellow">So you should know as such.</font>

457
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:17,690
<font color="yellow">Like this shining so blindly when I look at you</font>

458
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:26,470
<font color="yellow">You are my only one, if we get to love</font>

459
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:34,510
<font color="yellow">My one. If my one love can begin with you.</font>

460
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:42,970
<font color="yellow">The heart that I've guarding preciously and a love that we don't know its meaning</font>

461
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:52,100
<font color="yellow">For you I will use it for you. Each and every moment of mine</font>

462
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,540
<font color="yellow">for you.</font>

463
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:08,570
<font color="yellow">It's so interesting. How did that Ajussi hear your thought?</font>

464
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,740
<font color="yellow">I don't know. How did you come to hear me?</font>

465
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I just heard it as well.</font>

466
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,090
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I feel less burdened now that Heo Joon Jae can hear me.</font>

467
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:25,570
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have anything to lie about. It's like I can now live properly here.</font>

468
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,840
<font color="yellow">Normally, like everyone else.</font>

469
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,840
<font color="yellow">But you know, having lived my life, even though it appears easy,<br>the thing that's most difficult</font>

470
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,520
<font color="yellow">is living normally like everyone else.</font>

471
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,570
<font color="yellow">I will make sure I do this; getting old together like everyone else with Heo Joon Jae.</font>

472
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,850
<font color="yellow">All those women over there appear to be holding luxury bags, right?</font>

473
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:05,570
<font color="yellow">But look at them. They're carrying the bag overhead like< br>an umbrella because it's raining; that's a knockoff.</font>

474
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,480
<font color="yellow">And look at that woman behind.</font>

475
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,490
<font color="yellow">You see she's carrying her bag like it's some ancestral tablet.<br>That's the original.</font>

476
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,470
<font color="yellow">Can knockoff be rained on? The knockoff is not that different than the original real designer product, no?</font>

477
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:23,350
<font color="yellow">Though the outer appearance could be the same. <br>But there is one thing that you can't deceive.</font>

478
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,340
<font color="yellow">- What is that?<br>- The bag owner's feeling.</font>

479
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:32,620
<font color="yellow">You know you can't hide the owner. They know that their<br>bags are fake.</font>

480
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,270
<font color="yellow">Which is why they hold them like umbrellas and run when it rains.</font>

481
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,730
<font color="yellow">But even among the bag owners, whether the bag is the real<br>one or a fake one, treat it nicely and like it</font>

482
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,270
<font color="yellow">because simply it belongs to them.</font>

483
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,190
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying that it could be. I feel like I'm a fake in this world<br>for some reason.</font>

484
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:57,260
<font color="yellow">Still, I feel that [despite being a fake] perhaps I still deserve<br>to be loved by someone.</font>

485
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,290
<font color="yellow">Be that as it may, why are you so earnest? I was trying to be funny.</font>

486
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:13,420
<font color="yellow">You were trying to say that one shouldn't divide the real vs. fake by the outer appearance, right?</font>

487
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,000
<font color="yellow">- Yes.<br>- You're precise. Capable of summarizing.</font>

488
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,710
<font color="yellow">Thank you, two. I'm going to try all things that other people do normally.</font>

489
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,030
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, tomorrow is my birthday party.</font>

490
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:29,190
<font color="yellow">- Is tomorrow your birthday?<br>- Do you celebrate your solar or lunar calendar birthday?</font>

491
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,750
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Truthfully, I don't know when my birthday is, so I just decided to make it tomorrow. What's the date tomorrow, anyway?</font>

492
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,800
<font color="yellow">January 5th. It's succinct date. Nice.</font>

493
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,460
<font color="yellow">- Where is the party?<br>- At my house.</font>

494
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,530
<font color="yellow">I tend to refrain from visiting other people's houses,<br>but I'll come tomorrow.</font>

495
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,380
<font color="yellow">- Do you have any special Saeng Seon (fish) in mind you'd like to have?<br>- Mackerel.</font>

496
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,340
<font color="yellow">Not that kind of Saeng Seon (fish) but Saeng Il (birth) Seon Mool (present).</font>

497
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,150
<font color="yellow">Can't you just give me Mackerel for the birthday present?</font>

498
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,880
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes, Han Gyeol.</font>

499
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,080
<font color="yellow">I'm going to drop by the house right now. You come home right after your academy, too.</font>

500
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:14,720
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare a late night snack for you. I have to come back to the hospital right after.</font>

501

<font color="yellow"><i>Subtitles brought to you by The Blue Sea @ Viki</i></font>

503
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,760
<font color="yellow">You look a lot better.</font>

504
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,120
<font color="yellow">It's been really chilly out lately. Oh yeah.</font>

505
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,380
<font color="yellow">I saw you talking with Joon Jae the other day.</font>

506
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:15,420
<font color="yellow">Can you answer my questions, too?</font>

507
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:24,040
<font color="yellow">If Ma Dae Young made you like this, why did he?</font>

508
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:43,720
<font color="yellow">Is the person you think is associated with Ma Dae Young my mother?</font>

509
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:55,520
<font color="yellow">Of course. I knew it.</font>

510
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,320
<font color="yellow">Mother seems to feel relieved about the fact that</font>

511
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,620
<font color="yellow">you're lying down like this, not saying a word.</font>

512
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,720
<font color="yellow">But this isn't an issue about speaking.</font>

513
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,390
<font color="yellow">Right? The problem is...</font>

514

515
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,410

00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,620
<font color="yellow">Oh my, madam. How long has it been?</font>

521
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,380
<font color="yellow">It is you.</font>

522
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,000
<font color="yellow">I'm in a rush, so I'll get straight to it. Has Joon Jae not been studying abroad?</font>

523
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,580
<font color="yellow">I heard he left the house. Is it true?</font>

524
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:17,560
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. I actually lied at that time.</font>

525
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,640
<font color="yellow">I thought you be too upset.</font>

526
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,230
<font color="yellow">So, do you know how Joon Jae's been doing?</font>

527
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,780
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, I do. A while ago, my husband got into a big accident and has been lying in the hospital,</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>and Joon Jae sometimes visits.</i></font>

529
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,360
<font color="yellow">His phone number... Could you give it to me?</font>

530
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,280
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

531
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,330
<font color="yellow">Madam, I can't really seem small letters... I'll quickly go upstairs and get my glasses, so I can read it to you.</font>

546
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:06,380
<font color="yellow">Luckily, it was when they were switching shifts. You could have been in a lot of trouble.</font>

547
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,150

548
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,800

<font color="yellow">It's okay. I didn't really know when my birthday was so I decided it today</font>

561
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,690

00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,330
<font color="yellow">what is this? Is it food waste?</font>

576
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:29,140
<font color="yellow">Come on now, what are you talking about food waste? It's mackerel because the lady of the house said she likes it.</font>

577
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,900
<font color="yellow">But don't you have house slippers here?</font>

578
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,480
<font color="yellow">The lady of the house?</font>

579
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,830
<font color="yellow">Oh, oh, oh! Do-o-o-on't j-j-j-just sit down and s-s-s-sit with this under you!</font>

580
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:44,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you give steamed towels here to wash your hands? They usually give things like that.</font>

581
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,220
<font color="yellow">I don't usually eat raw foods because I'm used to eating only cooked foods.</font>

582
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,960
<font color="yellow">Yes, there's codfish soup here so at least have some codfish soup with rice later.</font>

583
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,410
<font color="yellow">But the cod doesn't seem to be wild cod. Codfish soup has to have fish intestines in it but it doesn't have that either.</font>

584
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,980
<font color="yellow">- So are you not going to eat? <br> - Of course, I have to eat it.</font>

585
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:28,500
<font color="yellow">It's still a party. I can't wreck the mood. Do you have jalapeños?</font>

586
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, Cheong. I've just gotten off the bus and I'm walking there.</font>

587
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,470
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

588
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,260
<font color="yellow">Why did you come out?</font>

589
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,320
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

590
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,380
<font color="yellow">Things like sea urchin seaweed soup, japchae (stir fried glass noodles), and bulgogi (grilled marinated beef).</font>

591
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:51,790
<font color="yellow">They were the things that I used to make long ago for him for his birthday. I don't know if they'll suit your tastes.</font>

592
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:56,710
<font color="yellow">After deciding on today for my birthday I feel somewhat like I've been reborn.</font>

593
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:00,210
<font color="yellow">The feeling of having been giving permission to live a new life here?</font>

594
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,330
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to organize my life and leave the house I've been living in. I was hiding all this time.</font>

595
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:11,750
<font color="yellow">Now, I will find the person I want to find, say what I want to... I want to live like that.</font>

596
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:31,090
<font color="yellow">Oh. It's my dummy.</font>

597
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,800
<font color="yellow">What is she so happy about? She smiles easily.</font>

598
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,910
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

599
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,080
<font color="yellow">My boyfriend. Heo Joon Jae!</font>

600
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:42,330
<font color="yellow">That dummy. I told her so many times not to call my name out loud when there's a lot of people.</font>

601
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:47,840
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!</font>

602
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,770
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

603
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:54,680
<font color="yellow">Your boyfriend's name is Heo Joon Jae?</font>

604
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,120
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's really good looking.</font>

605
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,060
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae's mom said that when he was young</font>

606
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,070
<font color="yellow"><i>If I was taken outside, it was hard to even take 10 steps.</i></font>

607
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:16,010
<font color="yellow"><i>Because people always wanted to touch and hug me.</i></font>

608
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,930
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

609
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:31,640
<font color="yellow">My son's name is the same.</font>

610
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:38,390
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae.</font>

611
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,390
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen him for a long time.</font>

612
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,590
<font color="yellow">Heracles Lighthouse?</font>

613
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:54,120
<font color="yellow"><i>They say Heracles' mom came here everyday and longed for her son who she was parted from.</i></font>

614
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,860
<font color="yellow"><i>After seeing that, the people who felt bad for her built that lighthouse </i></font>

615
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,200
<font color="yellow"><i>so that Heracles would follow the light from the lighthouse.</i></font>

616
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,020
<font color="yellow"><i>They say they prayed for him to cross the sea and find his mother.</i></font>

617
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:12,870
<font color="yellow"><i>So? Did Heracles find his mom?</i></font>

618
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:19,950
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not sure. But they have a legend here.</i></font>

619
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:24,030
<font color="yellow"><i>People with whom you get separated from here, you will meet them again for sure.</i></font>

620
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:42,390
<font color="yellow"><i>Heo Joon Jae, what the legend of the lighthouse stated true.</i></font>

621
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,110
<font color="yellow"><i>That those who get separated there will surely meet again.</i></font>

622
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,820
<font color="yellow"><i>That they meet again and love.</i></font>

623
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:58,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Congratulations. You got to meet your mom now.</i></font>
