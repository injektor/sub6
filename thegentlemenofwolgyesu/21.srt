55
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,655
<font color="yellow">I can't say it over the phone.</font>

56

60
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,925
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be waiting.</font>

61
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:22,825

<font color="yellow">Coming to the blind date impersonating Dong Sook...</font>

64
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,555
<font color="yellow">is a crime in itself,</font>

65
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,025
<font color="yellow">but how...</font>

66
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:36,725
<font color="yellow">How could you eat up 300 dollars of my money?</font>

67
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,355
<font color="yellow">What? 300 dollars?</font>

68
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,655
<font color="yellow">All I did was eat some meat and have coffee.</font>

69

<font color="yellow">"Some meat"?</font>

70
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,195
<font color="yellow">That's why I brought this.</font>

71
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:52,625
<font color="yellow">It's the receipt for what you ate that day. Look.</font>

72
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,965
<font color="yellow">Why are you so cheap?</font>

73
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,925
<font color="yellow">I've never met a man this cheap before in my life.</font>

74
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,465
<font color="yellow">What's the receipt for?</font>

75
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,695
<font color="yellow">It's the receipt from the restaurant for what I ate at the blind date.</font>

78
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:23,155

80
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,495
<font color="yellow">This lady's mouth...</font>

81
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,295
<font color="yellow">ate up my 300 dollars.</font>

82
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,525
<font color="yellow">Just thinking that makes me...</font>

83
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,725
<font color="yellow">I'm getting upset again.</font>

84
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:37,395
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll give you the 300 dollars.</font>

85
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,425
<font color="yellow">This isn't about the money.</font>

86
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:42,125
<font color="yellow">I'm acting like this because...</font>

87
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,725
<font color="yellow">I'm so angry about how she acted that day.</font>

88
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:45,955
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

89
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:49,255
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook asked me to go on the blind date for her.</font>

90
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,555
<font color="yellow">That's all I did.</font>

91
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,755
<font color="yellow">Even if she had asked, you should not have done it.</font>

92
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:58,495
<font color="yellow">If you have a conscience, you should not have come.</font>

93
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,725
<font color="yellow">Conscience?</font>

94
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,655
<font color="yellow">Look. Look.</font>

95
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,525
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything alike?</font>

96
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,395
<font color="yellow">Look and see if you have even 0.01 percent similarity.</font>

97
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:10,025
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you had the guts to show up there.</font>

98
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:14,525
<font color="yellow">Also, how will you compensate me for the emotional distress?</font>

99
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,525
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one who was distressed?</font>

100
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,825
<font color="yellow">I'm used to seeing my handsome husband's face,</font>

101
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:22,225
<font color="yellow">but I was distressed having to look at that nasty face of yours.</font>

102
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:25,425
<font color="yellow">I almost died because it made my blood pressure spike.</font>

103
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:27,155
<font color="yellow">Give me a break.</font>

104
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,725
<font color="yellow">Let's stop the nonsense.</font>

105
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,925
<font color="yellow">Give me my 300 dollars, and let's end it here.</font>

106
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:36,495
<font color="yellow">I will never give you the money. Over my dead body.</font>

107
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:42,495
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Dae Sub. Park Dae Sub of Jongno.</font>

108
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,825
<font color="yellow">I've never wasted money,</font>

109
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,495

<font color="yellow">The sun will set at this rate. Let's settle this and end it.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Over here. - Hey.</font>

116
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:11,355
<font color="yellow">Why? What is it?</font>

117
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,825
<font color="yellow">I can't believe the insult, Honey.</font>

118
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,025
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

119
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,025
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

120
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,255
<font color="yellow">Let's talk, man to man.</font>

121
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:23,695
<font color="yellow">I own two buildings in Jongno. I'm a building owner.</font>

122
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,125
<font color="yellow">I see. And?</font>

123
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,595
<font color="yellow">You know building owners are higher up than normal people.</font>

124
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,055
<font color="yellow">I didn't buy...</font>

125
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,725
<font color="yellow">two buildings by going around wasting money.</font>

126
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,125
<font color="yellow">That's a long introduction.</font>

127
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,495
<font color="yellow">Please get to the point.</font>

128
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,495
<font color="yellow">The point? Fine.</font>

129
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,125
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

130
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,225
<font color="yellow">that I get back...</font>

131
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,255
<font color="yellow">the 300 dollars that I spent...</font>

132
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,655
<font color="yellow">on your wife on the day we had the blind date.</font>

133
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,195
<font color="yellow">Did you really eat 300 dollars' worth of food?</font>

134
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,155
<font color="yellow">Take a look.</font>

135
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:59,295
<font color="yellow">This is the receipt from that day.</font>

136
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:17,995
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have given him the entire 300 dollars.</font>

137
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,295
<font color="yellow">You should've offered half and told him to take off.</font>

138
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,755
<font color="yellow">This is humiliating. Stop talking.</font>

139
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:25,025
<font color="yellow">I've never met someone so rude before in my life.</font>

140
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,125
<font color="yellow">He's a total monster.</font>

141
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:29,495
<font color="yellow">You have no right to talk.</font>

142
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:32,325
<font color="yellow">How could a married woman go on a blind date?</font>

143
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,565
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

144
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,565
<font color="yellow">I kept asking you to go to the OBGYN, but you refused,</font>

145
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:37,955
<font color="yellow">so I lost my senses.</font>

146
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:40,155
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

147
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,695
<font color="yellow">And if you went, you should've just had some tea.</font>

148
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:45,325
<font color="yellow">How could you eat 300 dollars' worth of food?</font>

149
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,725
<font color="yellow">You like free things way too much.</font>

150
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:49,955
<font color="yellow">I was wrong. I won't do it again.</font>

151
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:52,625
<font color="yellow">How embarrassing.</font>

152
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:54,655
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

153
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,565
<font color="yellow">Since you're here anyway, let's stop by the hospital.</font>

154
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:58,825
<font color="yellow">The hospital?</font>

155
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,395

312
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,455
<font color="yellow">Can you eat this?</font>

313
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,625
<font color="yellow">I'm not a picky eater.</font>

314
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,395
<font color="yellow">This is seonji, right?</font>

315
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:59,795
<font color="yellow">The broth is very dense.</font>

316
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:02,765
<font color="yellow">Can you really eat it?</font>

317
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,895
<font color="yellow">You said this is your regular spot.</font>

318
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,095
<font color="yellow">Didn't you bring me here because it's good?</font>

319
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:11,595
<font color="yellow">I thought the chairman's daughter wouldn't be able to eat this.</font>

320
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,125
<font color="yellow">Is that why you brought me here?</font>

321
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,995
<font color="yellow">You're terrible.</font>

322
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,955
<font color="yellow">Why are you so mean to me?</font>

323
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:26,955
<font color="yellow">Why do you hate me so much?</font>

324
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,325
<font color="yellow">Am I not your type?</font>

325
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:33,455
<font color="yellow">Or do you hate my voice?</font>

326
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:39,795
<font color="yellow">Or what do I do that annoys you?</font>

327
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:43,125
<font color="yellow">Tell me, and I'll fix everything you say.</font>

328
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,555
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

329

<font color="yellow">I'm poor, and my family has nothing to offer.</font>

331
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:56,595
<font color="yellow">I won't get much better, either.</font>

332
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,125
<font color="yellow">That isn't your fault.</font>

333
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:03,595
<font color="yellow">Is there another reason why we can't date?</font>

334
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,325
<font color="yellow">I have no intention of dating Mr Min Hyo Sang's sister.</font>

335
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,095
<font color="yellow">That's not a problem. I'll remove myself from the family registry.</font>

336
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:17,695
<font color="yellow">- What? - Well,</font>

337
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:20,355

338
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,525
<font color="yellow">So I've been begging to be removed from the family registry.</font>

339
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:24,395
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

340
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:25,695
<font color="yellow">I'm not kidding.</font>

341
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:38,265
<font color="yellow">That's so good. I feel so much better now.</font>

342
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:42,055
<font color="yellow">May I have some more broth, please?</font>

343
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:59,325
<font color="yellow">This is the best I can treat you to...</font>

344
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,825
<font color="yellow">by using up my month's living expense.</font>

345
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:07,295
<font color="yellow">I really enjoyed it. Thank you.</font>

346
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:11,355
<font color="yellow">The world you live in and the one I live in are very different.</font>

347
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:13,425
<font color="yellow">Being different isn't wrong.</font>

348
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,055
<font color="yellow">If they're different, we can just adjust to each other.</font>

349
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:22,425
<font color="yellow">I won't do anything you don't like.</font>

350
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,825
<font color="yellow">I won't bad-mouth your ex-girlfriend,</font>

351
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,595
<font color="yellow">and I won't be selfish and do whatever I want.</font>

352
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:31,425
<font color="yellow">So let's date.</font>

353
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:37,195
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you, who lacks nothing, is doing this.</font>

354
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:39,395
<font color="yellow">I know you may laugh,</font>

355
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:43,055
<font color="yellow">but I think it's fate.</font>

356
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:47,395
<font color="yellow">Ever since the first time I saw you,</font>

357
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,655
<font color="yellow">I just liked you.</font>

358
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:53,695
<font color="yellow">Are you always this easy?</font>

359
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:56,955
<font color="yellow">My gosh, I've never heard anyone say I was easy before.</font>

360
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,055
<font color="yellow">I'm not an easy girl.</font>

361
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:00,725
<font color="yellow">I have high standards.</font>

362
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,795
<font color="yellow">Then why are you doing this to me?</font>

363
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:05,595
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

364
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,025
<font color="yellow">don't seem to know what a great guy you are.</font>

365
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:15,095
<font color="yellow">You are very attractive and alluring.</font>

366
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,325
<font color="yellow">Enough for me to fall for you at first sight.</font>

367
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:18,755
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

368
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,395
<font color="yellow">have confidence. Okay?</font>

369
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:25,355
<font color="yellow">How can someone who doesn't love himself love someone else?</font>

370
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,825
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Goodness.</font>

371
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,495
<font color="yellow">Let's drink a little tonight...</font>

372

<font color="yellow">to celebrate advancing past the preliminary round.</font>

373
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:41,625

374
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,995

375
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,695
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Yun Shil, for your hard work.</font>

376
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:49,325
<font color="yellow">You really showed off your sewing skills...</font>

377
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,795
<font color="yellow">that you learned from Mr Lee.</font>

378
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,995
<font color="yellow">Not at all. You helped a lot.</font>

379
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:55,795
<font color="yellow">If we advance into the final round,</font>

380
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:58,725
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Mr Lee Man Sool would be so happy.</font>

381
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,795
<font color="yellow">It's getting cold now. I'm worried about him.</font>

382
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,295
<font color="yellow">I was confident and said...</font>

383
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,795

385
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,795
<font color="yellow">I have some stuff to take care of.</font>

386
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,925
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go home early.</font>

387
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,025
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

388
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:23,425
<font color="yellow">No. I think I'll be late tomorrow. Maybe an hour or two. I'm sorry.</font>

389
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,755
<font color="yellow">Don't be. You've been working late a lot lately.</font>

390
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,055
<font color="yellow">Nothing's wrong, right?</font>

391
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,225
<font color="yellow">No, I'll tell you later. It's nothing serious.</font>

392

<font color="yellow">The kids should be home soon.</font>

394
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,195
<font color="yellow">I'll go too, then.</font>

395
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:37,925
<font color="yellow">Let's drink more. We have a lot of beer left.</font>

396
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,755
<font color="yellow">Yes. Drink more. It's a happy occasion.</font>

397
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,055

<font color="yellow">Yes, it was.</font>

404
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,225

405
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:08,755
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Maybe I was afraid that if I told you the truth,</font>

406

<font color="yellow">you'd be moved and like me.</font>

<font color="yellow">about what I said earlier. I was just upset, that's all.</font>

461
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:03,955

<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

463
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,325
<font color="yellow">I was being thoughtful of you.</font>

464
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,995
<font color="yellow">I think a lot about you.</font>

465
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:20,255
<font color="yellow">True. Even I think I'm pathetic.</font>

<font color="yellow">Never mind. Forget it.</font>

470
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:42,225

00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:17,195
<font color="yellow">Why don't you wear your sneakers?</font>

480
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,295

481
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:23,255
<font color="yellow">Then why did you buy those sneakers?</font>

482
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:27,395

498
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:06,925
<font color="yellow">I want to give you your scarf back.</font>

499
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:08,395
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll take it.</font>

500
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:16,795

00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:22,165
<font color="yellow">Does it? I'll beat you to a pulp tonight.</font>

613
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:25,395
<font color="yellow">You know my lifelong dream is to become a mum.</font>

614
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:29,895
<font color="yellow">How could you get a vasectomy without talking to me first?</font>

615
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:31,755
<font color="yellow">Stop it. It hurts.</font>

616
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:33,895
<font color="yellow">You should respect your husband.</font>

617
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,495
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve respect.</font>

618
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:37,495
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - You deserve a beating.</font>

619
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:39,195
<font color="yellow">Don't stop me.</font>

620
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:41,495
<font color="yellow">It really hurts. Stop it.</font>

621
00:38:41,795 --> 00:38:44,895
<font color="yellow">I hit to hurt, not to tickle.</font>

622
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:48,025
<font color="yellow">- I'll call the police. - Call them!</font>

623
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,425
<font color="yellow">They'll have a murder-suicide on their hands.</font>

624
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:53,095
<font color="yellow">You can't hit me there.</font>

625
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,295
<font color="yellow">Save me! Is anyone there?</font>

626
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:57,665
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

627
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:00,555
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

628
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:02,055
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

629
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:04,695
<font color="yellow">Save me. Get my wife off me.</font>

630
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,165
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

631
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,795
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

632
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,525
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, what happened?</font>

633
00:39:12,555 --> 00:39:14,455
<font color="yellow">It's between us. Get out.</font>

634
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:16,755
<font color="yellow">- That's enough. - Calm down.</font>

635
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,355
<font color="yellow">Relax. Let's see if we can talk this out.</font>

636
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:22,055
<font color="yellow">Stay down. I'm not done with you!</font>

637
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:24,955
<font color="yellow">I said stop. There's a limit to my patience.</font>

638
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:29,255
<font color="yellow">You know how much I want to have a baby.</font>

639
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:31,895
<font color="yellow">How could you do this?</font>

640
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:37,325
<font color="yellow">How could you do something so cruel to me?</font>

641
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,725
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What did you do?</font>

642
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:49,255
<font color="yellow">Each time she gets so stubborn,</font>

643
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,455
<font color="yellow">I really think I'd rather die.</font>

644
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,755
<font color="yellow">I should be saying that!</font>

645
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:58,795
<font color="yellow">Can we please face reality?</font>

646
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:02,425
<font color="yellow">We're both too old to go on wanting a baby.</font>

647
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:04,325
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid that...</font>

648
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:07,395
<font color="yellow">you'll go on about it until I'm 60 unless I get a vasectomy.</font>

649
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:10,825
<font color="yellow">Is it wrong for me to want to get it done?</font>

650
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:15,255
<font color="yellow">Did you get your tunnel tied?</font>

651
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:18,665
<font color="yellow">No, not yet. I just made an appointment.</font>

652
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:20,455
<font color="yellow">You aren't a husband.</font>

653
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:23,555
<font color="yellow">Think about how you punched and kicked me.</font>

654
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,225
<font color="yellow">You aren't a wife.</font>

655
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:31,355
<font color="yellow">I won't let you off so easily!</font>

656
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:38,825
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo.</font>

657
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:42,395
<font color="yellow">Try to calm down a bit.</font>

658
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,725
<font color="yellow">Drink this and cool down.</font>

659
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:16,225
<font color="yellow">Her reaction didn't surprise me much.</font>

660
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:21,055
<font color="yellow">Her lifelong dream is to have a son that looks like you.</font>

661
00:41:21,995 --> 00:41:23,165
<font color="yellow">You're just...</font>

662
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:26,225
<font color="yellow">dashing her hopes in one swoop.</font>

663
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:28,525
<font color="yellow">I know how she feels.</font>

664
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:35,325
<font color="yellow">But she keeps getting her hopes up only to get disappointed.</font>

665
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:40,055
<font color="yellow">She gets so stressed, and seeing her...</font>

666
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:42,995
<font color="yellow">get upset when it doesn't work out...</font>

667
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:46,125
<font color="yellow">It breaks my heart.</font>

668
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,795
<font color="yellow">It's hard on me, too.</font>

669
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:54,425
<font color="yellow">I got so worked up that I booked for the procedure...</font>

670
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:58,255
<font color="yellow">so we could stop getting our hopes up altogether.</font>

671
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,355
<font color="yellow">It may be impossible,</font>

672
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:02,125
<font color="yellow">but that dream...</font>

673
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:05,255
<font color="yellow">could be the strength that keeps her going.</font>

674
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:07,995
<font color="yellow">Just like...</font>

675
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,825
<font color="yellow">how my dream of making a successful comeback...</font>

676
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:15,555
<font color="yellow">gives me the strength to keep going.</font>

677
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:23,095
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo will have to give up as time goes by.</font>

678
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:24,425
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

679
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:29,295
<font color="yellow">let her dream until then.</font>

680
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,165
<font color="yellow">Let her be.</font>

681
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:35,995
<font color="yellow">You're more thoughtful than I am.</font>

682
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:38,395
<font color="yellow">I went through a lot, you see.</font>

683
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:41,455
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

684
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,295
<font color="yellow">You really didn't get the surgery done, right?</font>

685
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,295
<font color="yellow">Not yet. Shall I show you?</font>

686
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:47,825
<font color="yellow">It's still intact.</font>

687
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:50,095
<font color="yellow">I only made a reservation.</font>

688
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:52,825
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

689
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:06,455
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

690
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:09,425
<font color="yellow">It was the perfect date.</font>

691
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:10,625
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a date.</font>

692
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,925
<font color="yellow">We had dinner and tea together.</font>

693
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,795
<font color="yellow">Then you brought me home.</font>

694
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,625
<font color="yellow">What is it if it's not a date?</font>

695
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:21,125
<font color="yellow">The dinner and tea was to make up for what you bought me.</font>

696
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,225
<font color="yellow">I brought you home because...</font>

697
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:26,355
<font color="yellow">you insisted you wouldn't take a taxi.</font>

698
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:30,825
<font color="yellow">I came along because I couldn't let you walk alone.</font>

699
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:35,925
<font color="yellow">You never let me have the last word.</font>

700
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,555
<font color="yellow">Look who's here. It's Kang Tae Yang.</font>

701
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:55,495
<font color="yellow">I wasn't feeling well,</font>

702
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:58,625
<font color="yellow">so I asked him to bring me home.</font>

703
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:02,025
<font color="yellow">Didn't you stay home today?</font>

704
00:44:02,555 --> 00:44:04,195
<font color="yellow">I went in for a bit this afternoon.</font>

705
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,225
<font color="yellow">I should go.</font>

706
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:28,355
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

707
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:30,525
<font color="yellow">- What? - Do you...</font>

708
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:32,525
<font color="yellow">have a crush on him?</font>

709
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,255
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

710
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:51,725
<font color="yellow">Where did you go? Why did you ignore my calls?</font>

711
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:55,055
<font color="yellow">I went to work.</font>

712
00:44:55,255 --> 00:44:57,355
<font color="yellow">What for? You were half-dead.</font>

713
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:02,295
<font color="yellow">I had some paperwork to take care of.</font>

714
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:11,125
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

715
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,925
<font color="yellow">I think she's up to something.</font>

716
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,925
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - Kang Tae Yang.</font>

717
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,755
<font color="yellow">He brought her home tonight.</font>

718
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,295
<font color="yellow">Who's he?</font>

719
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:22,595
<font color="yellow">- That employee of hers? - Yes.</font>

720
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:25,655
<font color="yellow">- He came to our door? - I saw them together.</font>

721
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,325
<font color="yellow">I should teach her a lesson.</font>

722
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:29,625
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

723
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:32,425
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved. It'll only backfire.</font>

724
00:45:32,795 --> 00:45:35,095
<font color="yellow">- I'll deal with it. - Will you?</font>

725
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:37,695
<font color="yellow">I have a plan.</font>

726
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:47,655
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

727
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:49,595
<font color="yellow">I have something to say.</font>

728
00:45:49,795 --> 00:45:51,655
<font color="yellow">If you want to tell me to quit my job,</font>

729
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:53,225
<font color="yellow">just go home.</font>

730
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,025
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang...</font>

731
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:56,825
<font color="yellow">knew everything.</font>

732
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,755
<font color="yellow">He knew about our relationship.</font>

733
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:01,195
<font color="yellow">- What? - He knew everything,</font>

734
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:04,325
<font color="yellow">and that's why he gave you the job.</font>

735
00:46:04,955 --> 00:46:06,625
<font color="yellow">- Is that true? - It is.</font>

736
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:08,255
<font color="yellow">I just found out.</font>

737
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:10,595
<font color="yellow">Why did he give me a job when he knew who I was?</font>

738
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:12,625
<font color="yellow">He wanted to know about you.</font>

739
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,595
<font color="yellow">He wanted to see if you were a worthy competitor or not.</font>

740
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,055
<font color="yellow">I bet he had fun...</font>

741
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:21,625
<font color="yellow">watching us try to pretend to be strangers when he knew...</font>

742
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:23,595
<font color="yellow">all about our past.</font>

743
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,625
<font color="yellow">- What? - Unless you want to act a fool,</font>

744
00:46:27,155 --> 00:46:28,425
<font color="yellow">quit your job.</font>

745
00:46:29,725 --> 00:46:31,425
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to say.</font>

746
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:36,095
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

747
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:37,895
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

748
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:42,995
<font color="yellow">Nothing will change.</font>

749
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:48,755
<font color="yellow">He said he'll forgive me and let everything slide.</font>

750
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:50,995
<font color="yellow">I'll go back.</font>

751
00:46:51,095 --> 00:46:53,955
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything to deserve forgiveness.</font>

752
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:57,255
<font color="yellow">Someone of his status can meet and date women...</font>

753
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:58,755
<font color="yellow">who are way better than me.</font>

754
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,195
<font color="yellow">But he still chose me.</font>

755
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:03,195
<font color="yellow">Unlike what he expected,</font>

756
00:47:04,025 --> 00:47:05,395
<font color="yellow">I have a shameful past.</font>

757
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:07,255
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes sense?</font>

758
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:08,555
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

759
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:11,095
<font color="yellow">Whether it makes sense or not isn't important.</font>

760
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:13,695
<font color="yellow">I will marry Hyo Sang at all costs.</font>

761
00:47:14,055 --> 00:47:15,155
<font color="yellow">That's how...</font>

762
00:47:15,795 --> 00:47:17,795
<font color="yellow">I'll escape my disgusting reality.</font>

763
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,995
<font color="yellow">I won't ask you to come back to me.</font>

764
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,825
<font color="yellow">But you can't marry someone like him.</font>

765
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:26,495

784
00:48:43,095 --> 00:48:45,995
<font color="yellow">I was actually just wondering if you had...</font>

785
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:47,595
<font color="yellow">gotten home safely.</font>

786

<font color="yellow">Were you?</font>

787
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:51,225
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that because you feel bad?</font>

788
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:52,725
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

789
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:54,555
<font color="yellow">Fine, then. See you tomorrow.</font>

790

791
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:02,455

792
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,555
<font color="yellow">I was really surprised to hear that you volunteered to be a judge...</font>

793

<font color="yellow">even during your tight schedule.</font>

794
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:28,095
<font color="yellow">I wanted to check how the Korean tailors are doing,</font>

795
00:49:28,295 --> 00:49:31,325
<font color="yellow">and also see if there are any artisan tailors we can partner with.</font>

796
00:49:31,425 --> 00:49:35,425
<font color="yellow">Artisan tailors. Exactly my point. You know Meesa Apparel.</font>

797
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:37,925
<font color="yellow">We're the ones who possess the best tailors in the country.</font>

798

<font color="yellow">You might have the best technicians,</font>

799
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:42,295
<font color="yellow">but I'm not sure if you have the best tailors, as well.</font>

800
00:49:42,395 --> 00:49:44,825
<font color="yellow">In fact, Mr Lee said he was going to show us...</font>

801
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:46,595
<font color="yellow">how to prepare for the artisan tailors.</font>

802
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:49,825
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid Mr Lee no longer works for Meesa Apparel any more.</font>

803
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:52,455
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee resigned from Meesa Apparel?</font>

804
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:53,895

809

<font color="yellow">Yes. I returned to my father's tailor shop.</font>

810
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:10,395
<font color="yellow">- Your father owns a tailor shop? - That's right.</font>
