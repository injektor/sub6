<font color="yellow">Wow, way to turn the tide!</font>

81
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,999
<font color="yellow">But you know, the thing
I'm really worried about</font>

82
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:41,499
<font color="yellow">is that Kim Je Ha may have
taken Kim Suk Han's memory card</font>

83
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:45,300
<font color="yellow">but had it taken from him
by Choi Yoo Jin.</font>

Where is he right now?</font>

86

all the hospitals' emergency rooms</font>

87
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100

to bring him to HQ.</font>

88

<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

89

00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir!</font>

155
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,600
<font color="yellow">We've succeeded.</font>

156
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? Great job!</font>

157
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,699
<font color="yellow">Hurry and take care of it, will you?</font>

158
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,500
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

159
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

160
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,199
<font color="yellow">Choi Yoo Jin is no more of a threat
now than a cat who's lost her teeth.</font>

161
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,199
<font color="yellow">So this is the end of
Choi Yoo Jin's prized Cloud Nine.</font>

162
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:26,000
<font color="yellow">But... Cloud Nine's classified info won't
be handed over to Park Kwan Soo, will it?</font>

163
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,100
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. We've sent
our own technicians</font>

164
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,199
<font color="yellow">so they'll do a good job.</font>

165
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,699
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

166
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,899
<font color="yellow">JB is yours now.</font>

167
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,100
<font color="yellow">But... I think it's a bit
premature to be celebrating.</font>

168
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,899
<font color="yellow">Choi Yoo Jin may have
Suk Han's memory card.</font>

169
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,100
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, I'm sure
the president won't just sit and watch</font>

170
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,500
<font color="yellow">now that his precious son
has been hurt.</font>

171
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,300
<font color="yellow">You're right, but there's probably
nothing that he can do either.</font>

172
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,100
<font color="yellow">Do you think that Suk Han really
had the memory card stolen from him?</font>

173
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,699
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

174
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:04,300
<font color="yellow">We'll only know for sure
when Suk Han wakes up.</font>

175
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,000
<font color="yellow">Are you awake, Doctor?</font>

176
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,500
<font color="yellow">What... what happened
to that guy?</font>

177
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,899
<font color="yellow">He's currently on the run.</font>

178
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,899
<font color="yellow">We believe that he's hiding
at JSS currently.</font>

179
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,500
<font color="yellow">We'll be able to
catch him soon.</font>

180
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
<font color="yellow">JSS.</font>

181
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,699
<font color="yellow">No, we can't touch them now.</font>

182
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,899
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean?</font>

183
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:49,500
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is...
that guy helped me.</font>

184
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,000
<font color="yellow">He helped me when
I was being chased.</font>

185
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,500
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that, sir?</font>

186
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,100
<font color="yellow">That guy had been chasing you
too from the hospital--</font>

187
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,600
<font color="yellow">Just go with the flow
and stop questioning me!</font>

188
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,318
<font color="yellow">You must not pursue that man.</font>

189
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:03,600
<font color="yellow">No matter what.</font>

190
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:07,899
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and spread the word.</font>

191
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:09,199
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

192
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

193
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,045
<font color="yellow">- It's strange!
- What is?</font>

194
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:24,000
<font color="yellow">All of this is just
general information!</font>

195
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,500
<font color="yellow">There's no way!</font>

196
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,300
<font color="yellow">Look harder!</font>

197
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,100
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

198
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:35,399
<font color="yellow">What? Pull out?</font>

199
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:37,300
<font color="yellow">Says who?</font>

200
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,899
<font color="yellow">The Blue House?</font>

201
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,399
<font color="yellow">Ugh... fine!</font>

202
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:46,500
<font color="yellow">Ugh!</font>

203
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,699
<font color="yellow">Why, I never!</font>

204
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
<font color="yellow">You sure are lucky, Senior.</font>

205
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,300
<font color="yellow">Being lucky is a skill
in its own right, isn't it?</font>

206
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:09,683
<font color="yellow">See? I told you that
I was a formidable foe.</font>

207
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:10,800
<font color="yellow">Indeed you did.</font>

208
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,399
<font color="yellow">Hey, sprinkle some salt here
to disinfect the place!</font>

209
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,600
<font color="yellow">Geez, what in the world
is going on here?</font>

210
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,300
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

211
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,500
<font color="yellow">Um, yes, sir.</font>

212
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,899
<font color="yellow">I received orders to pull out.</font>

213
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,000
<font color="yellow">What? Pull out?</font>

214
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.
That is...</font>

215
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:51,699
<font color="yellow">it was an order from the Blue House.</font>

216
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:52,899
<font color="yellow">The Blue House?</font>

217
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:57,620
<font color="yellow">So it was taken
from him after all.</font>

218
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,500
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean, sir?</font>

219
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,500
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

220
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,386
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

221
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:18,910
<font color="yellow">Je Ha definitely got
Kim Suk Han's memory card from him.</font>

222
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

223
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:24,000
<font color="yellow">That's why as soon as Suk Han
woke up at the hospital...</font>

224
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,541
<font color="yellow">Then... he thought that K2 had
the memory card on him</font>

225
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,000
<font color="yellow">- and did this of his own volition?
- Exactly.</font>

226
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
<font color="yellow">It means that we're
untouchable to him now.</font>

227
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,300
<font color="yellow">Because he's afraid we'll make
the contents of the memory card public</font>

228
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,800
<font color="yellow">if he makes one false move.</font>

229
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:44,300
<font color="yellow">That's exactly what happened.
I'm sure of it.</font>

230
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,699
<font color="yellow">That definitely seems plausible.</font>

231
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it.</font>

232
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,300
<font color="yellow">Have you searched Je Ha?</font>

233
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,100
<font color="yellow">Did you find the memory card
on him by any chance?</font>

234
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,600
<font color="yellow">No, Madam.</font>

235
00:29:57,026 --> 00:30:01,500
<font color="yellow">Search the inside of
the car just to be sure.</font>

236
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

237
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,286
<font color="yellow">And be sure to put
on a good face.</font>

238
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:08,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, Madam?</font>

239
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,800
<font color="yellow">Give off the impression that
you're at ease and confident.</font>

240
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:18,300
<font color="yellow">Put on an expression that says,
"we have the memory card."</font>

241
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:22,300
<font color="yellow">And Chief Joo,
hurry and find it.</font>

242
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

243
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,000
<font color="yellow">I heard that something
terrible almost happened to you!</font>

244
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:38,800
<font color="yellow">So? Was it taken from you?</font>

245
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,000
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
What would I have taken from me?</font>

246
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
<font color="yellow">Man, what are you going to do?</font>

247
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,000
<font color="yellow">Your dad doesn't have much
time left in office either.</font>

248
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,899
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just worry about
not losing your company</font>

249
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:51,500
<font color="yellow">to your older sister?</font>

250
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:55,600
<font color="yellow">It was Kim Je Ha, wasn't it?</font>

251
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,100
<font color="yellow">Yeah, of course you'd
get it taken from you.</font>

252
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:08,500
<font color="yellow">So... does Choi Yoo Jin
really have it?</font>

253
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

254
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,899
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, sir?</font>

255
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,399
<font color="yellow">Park Kwan Soo will back away on his
own if he knows that you have it.</font>

256
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,436
<font color="yellow">Because everyone
will be at your mercy then.</font>

257
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:29,100
<font color="yellow">And you'll be able to take down JB
and Choi Yoo Jin in one fell swoop too.</font>

258
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,199
<font color="yellow">This is the only way we can make Choi Yoo
Jin and Park Kwan Soo both face justice.</font>

259
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,139
<font color="yellow">To protect Anna.</font>

260
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:43,000
<font color="yellow">And to restore her mother's
reputation, which is what Anna wants.</font>

261
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,300
<font color="yellow">Where is Chief Joo right now?</font>

262
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,500
<font color="yellow">I'll locate him.</font>

263
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,000
<font color="yellow">You can't make it obvious that
we're looking for something.</font>

264
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,899
<font color="yellow">I can't find it anywhere, though.</font>

265
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Assemblyman?</font>

266
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,899
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for something
Je Ha dropped by any chance?</font>

267
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,500
<font color="yellow">How did you...</font>

268
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:50,300
<font color="yellow">Je Ha meant to
give that to me.</font>

269
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:56,100
<font color="yellow">So that I could take down Park Kwan Soo
and break free from Choi Yoo Jin's grasp.</font>

270
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,666
<font color="yellow">Seems like you're having
a difficult time believing me.</font>

271
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,411
<font color="yellow">Nevertheless, it's the truth.</font>

272
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,500
<font color="yellow">How else would I have known
about this otherwise?</font>

273
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,300
<font color="yellow">I'd like it if you brought it to me
when you find it.</font>

274
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,674
<font color="yellow">I want to, but...</font>

275
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:20,899
<font color="yellow">I know you're more on
Choi Yoo Jin's side than mine.</font>

276
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,280
<font color="yellow">But if that falls into
Choi Yoo Jin's hands</font>

277
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,000
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to be
a proper president.</font>

278
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,600
<font color="yellow">I'll be partly--no, completely--
a puppet president.</font>

279
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:37,100
<font color="yellow">And that'll be the case
until the end of my presidency.</font>

280
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:43,926
<font color="yellow">And then, the entire political system
will be no different from a marketplace.</font>

281
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:45,600
<font color="yellow">Please watch your words, sir.</font>

282
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not even sure if
I can find it just yet.</font>

283
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:04,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

284
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
<font color="yellow">Kim Je Ha almost died.</font>

285
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,699
<font color="yellow">Anyway, hurry up and get out.</font>

286
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam?</font>

287
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,100
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll head up there now.</font>

288
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,199
<font color="yellow">Head up? To where?</font>

289
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,500
<font color="yellow">The ninth floor.</font>

290
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,000
<font color="yellow">Je Ha... is on the ninth floor?</font>

291
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:32,300
<font color="yellow">Master Song.
Do you know where Je Ha is?</font>

292
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,199
<font color="yellow">Well, no. I don't know.</font>

293
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,899
<font color="yellow">Je Ha is in a lot of pain right now.
Please tell me where he might be.</font>

294
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:42,899
<font color="yellow">I'm not positive, but...</font>

295
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:47,899
<font color="yellow">he's a member of Cloud Nine,
so he's probably on the ninth floor.</font>

296
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,300
<font color="yellow">The ninth floor?</font>

297
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,399
<font color="yellow">You can't go there, Young Miss.</font>

298
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,699
<font color="yellow">Not just anyone can go there.</font>

299
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,600
<font color="yellow"><i>Please scan your access card.</i></font>

300
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,000
<font color="yellow">I told you, we can't go there.</font>

301
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,600
<font color="yellow">It's no use, Young Miss!</font>

302
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,000
<font color="yellow">Je Ha. Je Ha!</font>

303
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,799
<font color="yellow">Get her the hell out of here.</font>

304
00:35:58,299 --> 00:35:59,698
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

305
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,299
<font color="yellow">What are you all doing?</font>

306
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:07,299
<font color="yellow">Get rid of that outsider
on the ninth floor stairway.</font>

307
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,899
<font color="yellow">How's his condition?</font>

308
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:16,198
<font color="yellow">His condition has
become much better.</font>

309
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:20,100
<font color="yellow">All right. Good work.</font>

310
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:24,600
<font color="yellow">Make sure you contact me immediately
if his condition changes in any way.</font>

311
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

312
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:36,000
<font color="yellow">You can't act like this here, Young Miss!</font>

313
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
<font color="yellow">Please talk to
Madam for me, sir.</font>

314
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,000
<font color="yellow">Please ask her to let me see him!</font>

315
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,600
<font color="yellow">Just once! Please!</font>

316
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,799
<font color="yellow">Young Miss.
Let's come back later, okay?</font>

317
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:46,198
<font color="yellow">It won't be of any use
if you come back later either.</font>

318
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,500
<font color="yellow">Lady.</font>

319
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,600
<font color="yellow">Please let me see Je Ha.</font>

320
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,799
<font color="yellow">"Lady"?</font>

321
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,000
<font color="yellow">That's no way to refer to me.</font>

322
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,424
<font color="yellow">Say "Mom."</font>

323
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,397
<font color="yellow">"Mom."</font>

324
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:12,500
<font color="yellow">Isn't a stepmother
still a mother?</font>

325
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:22,100
<font color="yellow">Please let me see
Je Ha just once.</font>

326
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,799
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

327
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,399
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

328
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,799
<font color="yellow">Go home now.</font>

329
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,600
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

330
00:37:58,198 --> 00:37:59,799
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

331
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,198
<font color="yellow">Please, I'm begging you.</font>

332
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:26,399
<font color="yellow">Please let me see Je Ha.</font>

333
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,799
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

334
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,299
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, child?</font>

335
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, you pitiful thing!</font>

336
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,900
<font color="yellow">Get up, Anna!</font>

337
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, you pitiful thing!</font>

338
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes. I have to consider what'll
happen after Je Ha wakes up too.</i></font>

339
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,000
<font color="yellow">Anna.</font>

340
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:38,900
<font color="yellow">Je Ha is still in critical condition.</font>

341
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,799
<font color="yellow">And the wounds from his surgery
haven't closed up yet either.</font>

342
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,938
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

343
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:46,299
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

344
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,100
<font color="yellow">But you know, Anna...</font>

345
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:56,299
<font color="yellow">you're really
not going to leave?</font>

346
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:04,199
<font color="yellow">Won't it be hard for Je Ha to
protect you in his current state?</font>

347
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,299
<font color="yellow">When Je Ha gets better...</font>

348
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,900
<font color="yellow">I'll leave.</font>

349
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,000
<font color="yellow">But will you actually leave
when he gets better?</font>

350
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:38,618
<font color="yellow">Je Ha can't even go to the hospital
in the state he's in now.</font>

351
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:39,799
<font color="yellow">Because if he does</font>

352
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:43,299
<font color="yellow">he'll be arrested for attempted
murder against the president's son.</font>

353
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:50,400
<font color="yellow">I'm protecting Je Ha and putting
everything I have on the line to do so.</font>

354
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,900
<font color="yellow">Anna.</font>

355
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,900
<font color="yellow">It's time for you to
protect him now too.</font>

356
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,003
<font color="yellow">His identity has been leaked.</font>

357
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:03,900
<font color="yellow">And as long as you're here,
Je Ha won't be able to leave your side.</font>

358
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,699
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

359
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,100
<font color="yellow">he'll eventually be caught.</font>

360
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,199
<font color="yellow">I'll save Je Ha.</font>

361
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:15,047
<font color="yellow">So just leave.</font>

362
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:20,799
<font color="yellow">That's the best thing you
could possibly do for Je Ha.</font>

363
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:26,400
<font color="yellow">Go and do whatever you want to do.</font>

364
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,900
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for everything!</font>

365
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:34,100
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

366
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,400
<font color="yellow">if fate allows it, one day...</font>

367
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,400
<font color="yellow">you can meet him again.</font>

368
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:48,799
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

369
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,000
<font color="yellow">think of the housekeeper,
Mi Ran, and Sung Gyu.</font>

370
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,500
<font color="yellow">You want them to live, don't you?</font>

371
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

372
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,000
<font color="yellow">I'll leave.</font>

373
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:25,699
<font color="yellow">But in exchange...</font>

374
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,199
<font color="yellow">you have to help Je Ha
survive no matter what.</font>

375
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:21,275
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

376
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:28,467
<font color="yellow">Why are you so badly hurt?</font>

377
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,424
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

378
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,799
<font color="yellow">It hurt a lot, right?</font>

379
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,799
<font color="yellow">You're in a lot of pain, right?</font>

380
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,600
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

381
00:43:54,563 --> 00:43:56,699
<font color="yellow">What are we going
to do now, Je Ha?</font>

382
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:59,299
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do?</font>

383
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,299
<font color="yellow">Je Ha. Are you listening?</font>

384
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,600
<font color="yellow">You can't die.</font>

385
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:17,199
<font color="yellow">You can't die, Je Ha!</font>

386
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:22,299
<font color="yellow">You have to live, okay?</font>

387
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,799
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

388
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:54,199
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

389
00:44:59,828 --> 00:45:02,000
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

390
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:11,400
<font color="yellow">You can't die.</font>

391
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,600
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

392
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,100
<font color="yellow">Where are you planning to send
Anna off to this time?</font>

393
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,000
<font color="yellow">To Lafelt.</font>

394
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:44,000
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

395
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,500
<font color="yellow">I won't hide her anymore.</font>

396
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,900
<font color="yellow">There isn't even a need
to hide her anymore anyway.</font>

397
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,000
<font color="yellow">The whole world knows
about her after all.</font>

398
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,299
<font color="yellow">And that she's the daughter of
the oh-so-very-famous Ume Hye Rin.</font>

399
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:05,500
<font color="yellow">Everyone thinks that Ume Hye Rin
was a wicked witch now.</font>

400
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:12,299
<font color="yellow">And the online commenters stripped
Anna's status as an "angel" from her.</font>

401
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,098
<font color="yellow">But none of that matters overseas.</font>

402
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,299
<font color="yellow">That child...</font>

403
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:21,998
<font color="yellow">won't even want to
come back to Korea.</font>

404
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,699
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be quite good to Anna.</font>

405
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:34,900
<font color="yellow">And I'm going to make
her quite happy.</font>

406
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,699
<font color="yellow">Just as if she were
my own daughter.</font>

407
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:43,400
<font color="yellow">So that she won't even remember
her own mother anymore.</font>

408
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,098
<font color="yellow">She even called me "Mom," you know!</font>

409
00:46:53,998 --> 00:46:56,400
<font color="yellow">It's the first time
I've ever been called that!</font>

410
00:46:57,498 --> 00:46:59,799
<font color="yellow">"Mom"!</font>

411
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,900
<font color="yellow">Well, that's a relief at least.</font>

412
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,299
<font color="yellow">Our plans may be different, but we're
both striving for that happy ending.</font>

413
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,699
<font color="yellow">I'm positive that
Suk Hwan's memory card was stolen.</font>

414
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:28,199
<font color="yellow">Even though he's denying it.</font>

415
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,900
<font color="yellow">If it really is in
Choi Yoo Jin's hands now</font>

416
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,299
<font color="yellow">then we'll have to rearrange
our loyalties too, won't we?</font>

417
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,799
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about
the upcoming presidential election?</font>

418
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,098
<font color="yellow">Isn't that obvious?</font>

419
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:47,199
<font color="yellow">Don't get too ahead of yourselves now.</font>

420
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,598
<font color="yellow">First, let's monitor
the situation and...</font>

421
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:01,098
<font color="yellow"><i>I trust that everyone
is doing well?</i></font>

422
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,098
<font color="yellow">Did all of you receive a message?</font>

423
00:48:06,098 --> 00:48:11,598
<font color="yellow">The answer is obvious now, then,
if she's aware of exactly who is here.</font>

424
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:16,299
<font color="yellow">Looks like we have quite
a cute new member joining us.</font>

425
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,998
<font color="yellow">We'll have to reply
to her, won't we?</font>

426
00:48:29,098 --> 00:48:34,199
<font color="yellow">"Congratulations on being
our newest member"?</font>

427
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:06,998
<font color="yellow">Oh, Chairman!
What brings you here, sir?</font>

428
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:08,400
<font color="yellow">You're on your way to
work right now, right?</font>

429
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,598
<font color="yellow">- Well, yes.
- I'll give you a ride.</font>

430
00:49:10,598 --> 00:49:12,199
<font color="yellow">Let's have a chat.
It's been a while.</font>

431
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

432
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,799
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's not like she has
a lot of things to pack anyway.</font>

433
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:25,299
<font color="yellow">They said that we can't go with her.</font>

434
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:29,098
<font color="yellow">What if they're planning to
do away with us later on?</font>

435
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:31,598
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

436
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:34,400
<font color="yellow">No, they won't.</font>

437
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,900
<font color="yellow">Because they promised
me that they wouldn't.</font>

438
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,699
<font color="yellow">Young Miss!</font>

439
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:46,400
<font color="yellow">They said that
they'd leave you two alone.</font>

440
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:49,299
<font color="yellow">So don't worry too much.</font>

441
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:12,598
<font color="yellow"><i>Won't it be difficult for Je Ha to
protect you in his current state?</i></font>

442
00:50:13,598 --> 00:50:15,998
<font color="yellow">I'll save Je Ha.</font>

443
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:18,098
<font color="yellow">So just leave.</font>

444
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:23,699
<font color="yellow">That's the best thing you
could possibly do for Je Ha.</font>

445
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:31,199
<font color="yellow">Also, think of the housekeeper,
Mi Ran, and Sung Gyu.</font>

446
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:33,998
<font color="yellow">You want them to live, don't you?</font>

447
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

448
00:50:38,098 --> 00:50:39,699
<font color="yellow">I'll leave.</font>

449
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,900
<font color="yellow"><i>But in exchange...</i></font>

450
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:46,699
<font color="yellow"><i>you have to help Je Ha
survive no matter what.</i></font>

451
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:01,098
<font color="yellow">- Oh!
- Hello, Senior.</font>

452
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:03,199
<font color="yellow">You don't look like
you're doing too well.</font>

453
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:06,400
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

454
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,098
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I'm in the same boat as you.</font>

455
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:12,199
<font color="yellow">You're getting your company
taken from you, after all.</font>

456
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:14,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

457
00:51:15,098 --> 00:51:18,098
<font color="yellow">But it's not completely
the end yet.</font>

458
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:20,299
<font color="yellow">Do you want to form
an alliance with me?</font>

459
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:22,598
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that our chances of
surviving will improve then.</font>

460
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:26,400
<font color="yellow">You had so much fun in Iraq
all thanks to me, and yet</font>

461
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,199
<font color="yellow">you're suffering now because you
teamed up with my ignorant father-in-law.</font>

462
00:51:34,197 --> 00:51:40,400
<font color="yellow">I'll take Cloud Nine for myself,
and you can take Suk Han's memory card.</font>

463
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,699
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that sound good?</font>

464
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,400
<font color="yellow">Well, yes, of course. But...</font>

465
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,699
<font color="yellow">Never mind if you still actually
have anything to lose, though.</font>

466
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,400
<font color="yellow">Talk to me again after you
get everything from the ninth floor.</font>

467
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:57,199
<font color="yellow">But why does everyone think that
Cloud Nine is on the ninth floor?</font>

468
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:04,199
<font color="yellow">Well? Did you find it?</font>

469
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:07,098
<font color="yellow">Not yet, sir.</font>

470
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:11,900
<font color="yellow">Even though you
searched that much?</font>

471
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,098
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if Je Ha woke up
and told us where it was.</font>

472
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:19,098
<font color="yellow">Well, yeah.</font>

473
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:22,400
<font color="yellow">But we can't find it as of now.</font>

474
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:30,400
<font color="yellow">So if time keeps passing, they'll
eventually find out that we're bluffing.</font>

475
00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:33,598
<font color="yellow">Je Ha will just have to
wake up before that, then.</font>

476
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,400
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Je Ha.
- Yes?</font>

477
00:52:52,373 --> 00:52:53,900
<font color="yellow">Are you awake?</font>

478
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:03,199
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.
Mr. Je Ha is awake now.</font>

479
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,098
<font color="yellow"><i>Really? All right.
I'll head over there.</i></font>

480
00:53:07,098 --> 00:53:08,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam!</font>

481
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,799
<font color="yellow">Oh, you can't, Mr. Je Ha!
You'll be in big trouble if you move now!</font>

482
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,900
<font color="yellow">You have to lie still for the time being!</font>

483
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,598
<font color="yellow">But, um, where is...</font>

484
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:25,400
<font color="yellow">this place...</font>

485
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,498
<font color="yellow">Madam hid you from
the police by bringing you here.</font>

486
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:32,400
<font color="yellow">And... yesterday...</font>

487
00:53:34,248 --> 00:53:35,998
<font color="yellow">Ms. Anna came here.</font>

488
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,699
<font color="yellow">Anna did?</font>

489
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:44,299
<font color="yellow">Anna pleaded and begged,
so it seems Madam let her in.</font>

490
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,199
<font color="yellow">How is she now?</font>

491
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:48,699
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

492
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:50,998
<font color="yellow">Anna, I mean.</font>

493
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:54,098
<font color="yellow">Well, you know.
She's the same as always.</font>

494
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,255
<font color="yellow">- Mirror.
<i>- Yes, Agent Kim Je Ha?</i></font>

495
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:04,598
<font color="yellow">Do you record what goes on in here?</font>

496
00:54:04,598 --> 00:54:05,998
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes.</i></font>

497
00:54:05,998 --> 00:54:11,900
<font color="yellow">Then can you show me what happened
in here when she came yesterday?</font>

498
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,098
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes.</i></font>

499
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:15,400
<font color="yellow">All right. Show me.</font>

500
00:54:35,098 --> 00:54:36,598
<font color="yellow"><i>It hurt a lot, right?</i></font>

501
00:54:36,598 --> 00:54:38,400
<font color="yellow"><i>It must hurt.</i></font>

502
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:41,598
<font color="yellow"><i>You're in a lot of pain, right?</i></font>

503
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:50,400
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

504
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:55,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Je Ha. What do we do now?</i></font>

505
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:59,098
<font color="yellow"><i>What are we going to do?</i></font>

506
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:10,900
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

507
00:55:17,098 --> 00:55:18,598
<font color="yellow">I love you, Je Ha.</font>

508
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,799
<font color="yellow">You have to survive
no matter what.</font>

509
00:55:26,714 --> 00:55:27,714
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

510
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,699
<font color="yellow"><i>Je Ha!</i></font>

511
00:55:56,998 --> 00:55:58,400
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry.</i></font>

512
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:04,299
<font color="yellow"><i>But love is a luxury that
neither of us can afford.</i></font>

513
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:22,898
<font color="yellow">So, if we launch a sneak attack now</font>

514
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:27,898
<font color="yellow">we can get both Cloud Nine
and Choi Yoo Jin?</font>

515
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:30,499
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

516
00:56:30,499 --> 00:56:34,200
<font color="yellow">But if something goes wrong, we might
just make things worse for ourselves.</font>

517
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:37,398
<font color="yellow">That's why timing is of utmost
importance with these things.</font>

518
00:56:37,398 --> 00:56:40,700
<font color="yellow">Even if Kim Je Ha wakes up</font>

519
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,798
<font color="yellow">he won't be able to last long,
since he's so badly injured.</font>

520
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:47,398
<font color="yellow">Can you really trust the person
who'd be letting us in, though?</font>

521
00:56:48,327 --> 00:56:50,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, don't worry!</font>

522
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,898
<font color="yellow">Just make sure that
you prepare yourself well, Senior.</font>

523
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,398
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

524
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:21,599
<font color="yellow">So... you're awake.</font>

525
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:34,099
<font color="yellow">You did take the memory card
from Suk Han, right?</font>

526
00:57:37,398 --> 00:57:39,099
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

527
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, we don't have time
for this right now!</font>

528
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,099
<font color="yellow">I didn't steal that to give to you.</font>

529
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:55,997
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

530
00:57:55,997 --> 00:58:01,401
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what dangers we
faced to keep you alive and hidden--</font>

531
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:02,599
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

532
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:06,588
<font color="yellow">Well, then?</font>

533
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,800
<font color="yellow">Why did you bother with
stealing it at all, then?</font>

534
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,599
<font color="yellow">To destroy Park Kwan Soo.</font>

535
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:15,200
<font color="yellow">Exactly! That's why we
want you to hand it over!</font>

536
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,700
<font color="yellow">No. Because you won't be able
to destroy Park Kwan Soo with it anyway.</font>

537
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:24,200
<font color="yellow">And why is that?</font>

538
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,700
<font color="yellow">Because if it gets out,
JB Group will crumble too.</font>

539
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:34,599
<font color="yellow">The person who's most deeply
involved in all this is Chairman Choi.</font>

540
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:37,898
<font color="yellow">So you won't be able to reveal
its contents to the world</font>

541
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:40,099
<font color="yellow">if you have no intention of
destroying JB Group.</font>

542
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,200
<font color="yellow">Fine, then.</font>

543
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:50,099
<font color="yellow">So it'll be the best security
measure at the very least.</font>

544
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:51,999
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

545
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,398
<font color="yellow">I didn't steal it to protect you.</font>

546
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,204
<font color="yellow">Well, then? Why?</font>

547
00:59:02,177 --> 00:59:06,599
<font color="yellow">It'll be the new version of
the email I had against you before.</font>

548
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:13,798
<font color="yellow">To protect myself and Anna from you.</font>

549
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:32,398
<font color="yellow">Damn it, this is all wrong!</font>

550
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:35,798
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, they'll see through
our bluff sooner or later!</font>

551
00:59:36,598 --> 00:59:40,698
<font color="yellow">Man, what are we
supposed to do about this?</font>

552
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

553
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,098
<font color="yellow">In my opinion, Madam Choi
has gone completely mad.</font>

554
00:59:46,098 --> 00:59:47,299
<font color="yellow">Gone completely mad?
Do you mean...</font>

555
00:59:47,299 --> 00:59:51,698
<font color="yellow">She's way too crazy about that punk!</font>

556
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:53,094
<font color="yellow">Crazy about him?</font>

557
00:59:53,094 --> 00:59:54,698
<font color="yellow">Geez, and you're usually
so quick on the uptake too!</font>

558
00:59:54,698 --> 00:59:57,000
<font color="yellow">How could you be so ignorant
about romantic things?</font>

559
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:58,698
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

560
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:01,698
<font color="yellow">Madam Choi would've definitely
used any means necessary</font>

561
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:05,399
<font color="yellow">to have him tell her where the memory
card was if he were anyone else</font>

562
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:08,257
<font color="yellow">especially with that temper of hers!</font>

563
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:09,698
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

564
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,799
<font color="yellow">All right. Are you planning to
remain here then, Chief Joo?</font>

565
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:18,346
<font color="yellow">I mean, come on.</font>

566
01:00:18,346 --> 01:00:21,098
<font color="yellow">It's clear that your dreams of
becoming a cool Chief of Security</font>

567
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:23,899
<font color="yellow">serving the president
and his family at the Blue House</font>

568
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:27,799
<font color="yellow">is nothing more than
a mere pipe dream now.</font>

569
01:00:29,198 --> 01:00:34,198
<font color="yellow">Sir, please calm down first.</font>

570
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,098
<font color="yellow">Um, okay.</font>

571
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:46,299
<font color="yellow">Oh, um...</font>

572
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:50,201
<font color="yellow">aren't you working as a bodyguard
at the assemblyman's event today?</font>

573
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:52,500
<font color="yellow">Yes. I have to head out now.</font>

574
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,399
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about this again
later after I get back.</font>

575
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:57,198
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that.</font>

576
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,299
<font color="yellow">Then....</font>

577
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:13,899
<font color="yellow">you did it in order to take me down?</font>

578
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:23,299
<font color="yellow">So you did.</font>

579
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:27,160
<font color="yellow">But why?</font>

580
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,698
<font color="yellow">You're... my friend, aren't you?</font>

581
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:37,299
<font color="yellow">Have you ever wept
out of pity before?</font>

582
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:46,598
<font color="yellow">My entire life has been
full of nothing but tears.</font>

583
01:01:48,698 --> 01:01:51,098
<font color="yellow">No, I don't mean
out of self-pity.</font>

584
01:01:52,198 --> 01:01:54,399
<font color="yellow">I mean out of pity
for someone else.</font>

585
01:01:55,198 --> 01:01:57,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you haven't, much.</font>

586
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,399
<font color="yellow">Because you people are
oh-so-sensitive about your own pain</font>

587
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:08,098
<font color="yellow">whereas the pain of others
means nothing to you.</font>

588
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:13,500
<font color="yellow">But you know, other people
get hurt too, just like you do.</font>

589
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,399
<font color="yellow">The old cleaning lady and the
old couple from the orchard too.</font>

590
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:20,399
<font color="yellow">And the housekeeper,
Mi Ran, and Sung Gyu too.</font>

591
01:02:20,899 --> 01:02:22,698
<font color="yellow">And Raniya too.</font>

592
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:28,698
<font color="yellow">And those people want to become
happy, just like you people.</font>

593
01:02:28,698 --> 01:02:31,500
<font color="yellow">Well, of course.
Everyone wants to be happy.</font>

594
01:02:32,198 --> 01:02:33,698
<font color="yellow">From their own place in life.</font>

595
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:37,728
<font color="yellow">Just like you people killed Ume Hye
Rin to maintain your place in life</font>

596
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:40,899
<font color="yellow">you're capable of killing
many others easily too.</font>

597
01:02:41,899 --> 01:02:43,598
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,000
<font color="yellow">I can't be your friend.</font>

599
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,198
<font color="yellow">Oh, also...</font>

600
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:54,698
<font color="yellow">it's not friends you need right now.</font>

601
01:02:54,698 --> 01:02:57,098
<font color="yellow">You need people like Chief Kim,
who worship you.</font>

602
01:02:57,098 --> 01:02:59,399
<font color="yellow">Or a person whom you could worship.</font>

603
01:02:59,399 --> 01:03:01,299
<font color="yellow">That's what you really need.</font>

604
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:04,698
<font color="yellow">Just like how you worshipped
Jang Se Joon when you were young.</font>

605
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:08,299
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

606
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,098
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but neither of
those options suit me.</font>

607
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:37,299
<font color="yellow">So? Have you made a decision?</font>

608
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,299
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting for you.</font>

609
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,198
<font color="yellow">We have no time. Hurry!</font>

610
01:04:17,547 --> 01:04:21,500
<font color="yellow">Oh no, it fell!
Hey, clean this up.</font>

611
01:04:22,899 --> 01:04:25,799
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'll look at the monitors, okay?
So clean this up already!</font>

612
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:27,399
<font color="yellow">Oh, geez.</font>

613
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,698
<font color="yellow">I'm not usually so clumsy.</font>

614
01:04:30,698 --> 01:04:32,681
<font color="yellow">- Go and get a rag.
- Yes, sir.</font>

615
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:35,000
<font color="yellow">And put this back up, okay?</font>

616
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,698
<font color="yellow">- Got it?
- Yes, sir.</font>

617
01:04:47,056 --> 01:04:48,500
<font color="yellow">Check to see who they are.</font>

618
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,799
<font color="yellow">Get them!</font>

619
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,399
<font color="yellow">Wow, they sure are
good at fighting, huh?</font>

620
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,299
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

621
01:05:58,598 --> 01:06:02,399
<font color="yellow">Wow, you brought plenty
of guys with you too!</font>

622
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:09,698
<font color="yellow">Thanks for working so hard, guys.</font>

623
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:15,000
<font color="yellow">Atta boy!</font>

624
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,500
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

625
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:32,198
<font color="yellow">don't want you to worship me.</font>

626
01:06:34,098 --> 01:06:35,899
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

627
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:41,000
<font color="yellow">- I just...
- You just wanted to coddle me.</font>

628
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,399
<font color="yellow">And make me into another
one of your slaves.</font>
