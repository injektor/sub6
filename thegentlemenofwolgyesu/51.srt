00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad to see you again.</font>

4
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:08,982
<font color=#FFFF00>From this day forward,</font>

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be responsible for the revival of...</font>

6
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:13,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa Apparel.</font>

7
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:16,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa Apparel is passing through...</font>

8
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:19,172
<font color=#FFFF00>the most critical stage in its history. However,</font>

9
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:22,012
<font color=#FFFF00>we can make a change.</font>

10
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Meesa Apparel has overcome...</font>

11
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,572
<font color=#FFFF00>such crises before.</font>

12
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,272
<font color=#FFFF00>We have experiences and knowledge.</font>

13
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:31,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think we're facing this crisis...</font>

14
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,572
<font color=#FFFF00>due to your lack of capabilities.</font>

15
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:38,412
<font color=#FFFF00>The management did not understand the market situation...</font>

16
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:40,342
<font color=#FFFF00>and made a wrong decision.</font>

17
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:41,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Therefore,</font>

18
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:44,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I will not hold you accountable for the crisis.</font>

19
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,542
<font color=#FFFF00>The former CEO Min Hyo Sang...</font>

20
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:52,372
<font color=#FFFF00>made a mistake of aggressively expanding growth...</font>

21
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:54,072
<font color=#FFFF00>with his youthful vigor.</font>

22
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,342
<font color=#FFFF00>However,</font>

23
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:59,942
<font color=#FFFF00>he offered his private fortune to revive the company.</font>

24
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,242
<font color=#FFFF00>He did his best as a CEO.</font>

25
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>So, we should not...</font>

26
00:01:03,912 --> 00:01:06,972
<font color=#FFFF00>point fingers at each other.</font>

27
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:09,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Here are my plans.</font>

28
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:10,372
<font color=#FFFF00>First,</font>

29
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:12,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I will reduce costs by reducing unprofitable...</font>

30
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,972
<font color=#FFFF00>business departments in the company.</font>

31
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Second,</font>

32
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:18,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I will operate an integrated distribution center.</font>

33
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,912
<font color=#FFFF00>We will sell the remaining real estate and obtain funds.</font>

34
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:23,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Third.</font>

35
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:26,742
<font color=#FFFF00>We will promote our technique for manufacturing off-the-shelf suits...</font>

36
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:29,212
<font color=#FFFF00>and increase long-term profit.</font>

37
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:33,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I am confident that we, Meesa Apparel can use this challenge...</font>

38
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,842
<font color=#FFFF00>to improve upon ourselves.</font>

39
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:38,372
<font color=#FFFF00>And at the core will be...</font>

40
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:41,042
<font color=#FFFF00>all of you.</font>

41
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,342
<font color=#FFFF00>(Identification Card, Design Department, Min Hyo Won)</font>

42
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,672
<font color=#FFFF00>(Design Team 1)</font>

43
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:10,512
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my gosh. Ms Min. - Ms Min!</font>

44
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,872
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you all been?</font>

45
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:18,542
<font color=#FFFF00>We've been well. We're glad to have you back.</font>

46
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome back.</font>

47
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

48
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll work extra hard to make up for the time I've been away,</font>

49
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,312
<font color=#FFFF00>so I'll need your help.</font>

50
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's work hard.</font>

51
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,482
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Okay.</font>

52
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:41,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

53
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:44,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, Mr Lee.</font>

54
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:46,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How's your mother?</font>

55
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Whining, of course.</font>

56
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>But thanks to your generosity,</font>

57
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm back at work...</font>

58
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,542
<font color=#FFFF00>and Hyo Sang is able to avoid being unemployed,</font>

59
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:57,312
<font color=#FFFF00>so she's very grateful.</font>

60
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sincerely grateful as well.</font>

61
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,542
<font color=#FFFF00>How does it feel to be back after so long?</font>

62
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel motivated and like I can do anything.</font>

63
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:10,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't end up being an outcast like before, will you?</font>

64
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,142
<font color=#FFFF00>That will not happen.</font>

65
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:18,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I've become a completely different person since I met Tae Yang.</font>

66
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not the Min Hyo Won of old.</font>

67
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:24,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. You do seem to have matured a lot since you met him.</font>

68
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to work hard...</font>

69
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:32,372
<font color=#FFFF00>and help you and the company.</font>

70
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:36,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope that determination doesn't fade and you work hard,</font>

71
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Min Hyo Won.</font>

72
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:39,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mr Lee Dong Jin.</font>

73
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm burning up inside. I can't stand it.</font>

74
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

75
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mum.</font>

76
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,212
<font color=#FFFF00>What now?</font>

77
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I really can't do this.</font>

78
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,542
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I, Min Hyo Sang,</font>

79
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,072
<font color=#FFFF00>be sewing in a tiny tailor shop?</font>

80
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:28,212
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a slapstick comedy, Mum.</font>

81
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:30,442
<font color=#FFFF00>This is impossible in real-life.</font>

82
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop whining.</font>

83
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin did it, too.</font>

84
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:37,812
<font color=#FFFF00>That's because he grew up with a father who ran a tailor shop.</font>

85
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,282
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the founder of Meesa Apparel's only son.</font>

86
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:43,012
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not the same. You can't compare us!</font>

87
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:46,042
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. You ran the company to the ground...</font>

88
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,342
<font color=#FFFF00>within a year of becoming CEO.</font>

89
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:51,042
<font color=#FFFF00>- How could you dare compare? - Mum!</font>

90
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:54,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake up and smell the coffee. Crawl on your hands and feet...</font>

91
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,442
<font color=#FFFF00>- and do as Dong Jin says. - Come on.</font>

92
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I can't breathe.</font>

93
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin promised to bring you back to headquarters...</font>

94
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,442
<font color=#FFFF00>if you learn how to make suits there.</font>

95
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,072
<font color=#FFFF00>So just be patient.</font>

96
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:10,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Look, I can handle anything else,</font>

97
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,542
<font color=#FFFF00>but there's a freak tailor here named Bae Sam Do.</font>

98
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,442
<font color=#FFFF00>That jerk is a total freak. He talks so much.</font>

99
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:18,472
<font color=#FFFF00>He never stops nagging me. I'm going to lose my mind.</font>

100
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:21,342
<font color=#FFFF00>He treats me like I'm his subordinate or something.</font>

101
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:27,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Sir. I'll look into it and get back to you. Okay.</font>

102
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,272
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

103
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:43,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Whenever you get a chance,</font>

104
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:45,212
<font color=#FFFF00>you're on the phone or the computer.</font>

105
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you keep slacking off?</font>

106
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Why you...</font>

107
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,942
<font color=#FFFF00>You keep nagging and ordering me around.</font>

108
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Am I your assistant? - I'm glad you brought that up.</font>

109
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:55,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, you are my assistant.</font>

110
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang is an assistant. Sam Do is your boss.</font>

111
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:00,242
<font color=#FFFF00>You realise how strict hierarchy is in this industry, right?</font>

112
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,242
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't want to get fired, get back to work.</font>

113
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:07,242
<font color=#FFFF00>And stop drinking so much coffee. Or buy it yourself.</font>

114
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:09,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to lose my mind.</font>

115
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:21,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll test your sewing skills an hour from now, so be ready.</font>

116
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you to test me?</font>

117
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:28,412
<font color=#FFFF00>What? I guess you don't want to return to headquarters.</font>

118
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll combine your work attitude and sewing test score...</font>

119
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,512
<font color=#FFFF00>and send it to Mr Lee Dong Jin on a daily basis.</font>

120
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:38,372
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's below 60, you fail.</font>

121
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm speechless.</font>

122
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Look, guy.</font>

123
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:46,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Things kind of happened and I ended up here,</font>

124
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:50,542
<font color=#FFFF00>so you must be mistaken, thinking you and I are in similar situations,</font>

125
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:54,172
<font color=#FFFF00>but listen. You and I are on completely different levels!</font>

126
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Meesa Apparel's founder's son!</font>

127
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,872
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is that right? - That's right!</font>

128
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,842
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're the founder's son? - That's right!</font>

129
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that what you expected, you punk?</font>

130
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:05,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop barking like a mad dog.</font>

131
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:07,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake up, unless you want a beating.</font>

132
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Have some hot tea and let it go.</font>

133
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:18,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Thank you.</font>

134
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,242
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so hard to get treated like a human being here.</font>

135
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,372
<font color=#FFFF00>It's hot.</font>

136
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

137
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,912
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Tae Yang.</font>

138
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:47,672
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

139
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,642
<font color=#FFFF00>My training started today, and I picked up short rib soup...</font>

140
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,012
<font color=#FFFF00>on my way back.</font>

141
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I could eat right now?</font>

142
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:58,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to just hang myself.</font>

143
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop saying things like that.</font>

144
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried it on my way back with my coworkers,</font>

145
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>and the soup tastes awesome.</font>

146
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:16,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is the fan...</font>

147
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:19,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I needed some air.</font>

148
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:25,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll catch a cold. You need to stay warm and eat nourishing foods.</font>

149
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Please try some.</font>

150
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no appetite.</font>

151
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,012
<font color=#FFFF00>You should eat before it gets cold.</font>

152
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

153
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

154
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:50,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Life is so cruel.</font>

155
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:54,882
<font color=#FFFF00>How did this happen to me?</font>

156
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm always crying in front of you.</font>

157
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:04,112
<font color=#FFFF00>You think I'm pathetic, don't you?</font>

158
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Definitely not.</font>

159
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:08,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Every time you cry, I feel my heart break.</font>

160
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:11,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you kissing up to me?</font>

161
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not. I mean it.</font>

162
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't expect me...</font>

163
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,472
<font color=#FFFF00>to change my mind just because you're doing this.</font>

164
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

165
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Please eat before it gets cold.</font>

166
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Put some rice in it. - Okay.</font>

167
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, Ms Min Hyo Joo is coming in.</font>

168
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations on your first day as CEO, Mr Lee Dong Jin.</font>

169
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:00,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

170
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Finally, the rightful owner is back in the room.</font>

171
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:13,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that you're back,</font>

172
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:16,612
<font color=#FFFF00>it feels like everything is back to where it belongs.</font>

173
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:20,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to make something clear to you.</font>

174
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:25,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I returned to Meesa Apparel only because I thought...</font>

175
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,512
<font color=#FFFF00>things were over for good between us.</font>

176
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt bad toward my wife...</font>

177
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:33,642
<font color=#FFFF00>for returning to the company where you were,</font>

178
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:36,742
<font color=#FFFF00>but I did it because she has complete faith in me.</font>

179
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:38,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want to say?</font>

180
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Just in case,</font>

181
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,672
<font color=#FFFF00>don't do anything that may cause my wife any misunderstandings.</font>

182
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying this in case you have any misconceptions or hope.</font>

183
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,642
<font color=#FFFF00>We won't meet other than for work,</font>

184
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:53,382
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't come here unless you have a business matter to discuss.</font>

185
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Must you be so cold?</font>

186
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:59,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want my wife to be hurt because of you.</font>

187
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop saying, "my wife" this, "my wife" that.</font>

188
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you doing that on purpose?</font>

189
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:07,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you see that I'm hurt because of you?</font>

190
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:08,912
<font color=#FFFF00>It isn't because of me,</font>

191
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:11,372
<font color=#FFFF00>but because you won't let go.</font>

192
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:15,472
<font color=#FFFF00>So let go of me. Stop clinging on.</font>

193
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I got what you mean.</font>

194
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:21,912
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to repeat yourself.</font>

195
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:24,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hearing it over and over again...</font>

196
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:28,472
<font color=#FFFF00>only makes it worse.</font>

197
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,412
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me.</font>

198
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:46,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

199
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You sound a bit tired.</font>

200
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:52,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a meeting as soon as I got here,</font>

201
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,372
<font color=#FFFF00>and another one at lunchtime.</font>

202
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:56,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have more left.</font>

203
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,912
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like I'll be in meetings all day today.</font>

204
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:01,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you eat lunch?</font>

205
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a sandwich.</font>

206
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Continuous meetings are tiring even on a full stomach.</font>

207
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,342
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've had more than a sandwich.</font>

208
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:09,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget about food.</font>

209
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:11,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't seem to recharge...</font>

210
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:13,372
<font color=#FFFF00>because you aren't around.</font>

211
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,312
<font color=#FFFF00>We were together all day at the store...</font>

212
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:16,772
<font color=#FFFF00>and that kept me going.</font>

213
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:19,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I think my battery's almost flat.</font>

214
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that you don't work here anymore,</font>

215
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:24,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel lonely and a bit down.</font>

216
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't seem to settle in at work.</font>

217
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Being apart made you...</font>

218
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,542
<font color=#FFFF00>a bit more aggressive in showing your love.</font>

219
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, it's time for you to attend the board meeting.</font>

220
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I have another meeting.</font>

221
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:38,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay, go ahead. - Just a moment.</font>

222
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:41,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Being apart isn't working for either of us.</font>

223
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,372
<font color=#FFFF00>How about I got back to the store?</font>

224
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that.</font>

225
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just kidding.</font>

226
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:50,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be completely exhausted when I get home tonight.</font>

227
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:52,512
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better charge me up.</font>

228
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. Go to your meeting.</font>

229
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. Cheer up yourself.</font>

230
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't I tell you to use the thimble?</font>

231
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,512
<font color=#FFFF00>That thing is so uncomfortable.</font>

232
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:08,972
<font color=#FFFF00>It makes my fingers stiff...</font>

233
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,572
<font color=#FFFF00>and harder to sew.</font>

234
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if your fingers lock up,</font>

235
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:14,212
<font color=#FFFF00>we use it to work safely.</font>

236
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I use one!</font>

237
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:17,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you an expert. Are you better than me?</font>

238
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Why won't you use it?</font>

239
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare the ex-CEO of a company...</font>

240
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,872
<font color=#FFFF00>not even have the right attitude?</font>

241
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You lack all the basics. Now put it on.</font>

242
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How can someone nag so much?</font>

243
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,142
<font color=#FFFF00>He's like a middle-aged woman.</font>

244
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:28,512
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

245
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:29,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing at all.</font>

246
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:31,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You're infuriating. Watch.</font>

247
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,112
<font color=#FFFF00>This is called hemming.</font>

248
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:36,472
<font color=#FFFF00>It's used...</font>

249
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,742
<font color=#FFFF00>to hem pant bottoms, sleeves or seams.</font>

250
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You go down and up like this.</font>

251
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Bottom first.</font>

252
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you come up.</font>

253
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:48,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Bottom first then up. You do it.</font>

254
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:57,072
<font color=#FFFF00>If you stick the needle so deep, the thread will show.</font>

255
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,042
<font color=#FFFF00>It shouldn't show on the other side.</font>

256
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather teach an ox how to sew.</font>

257
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:02,772
<font color=#FFFF00>You lack the basic knowledge.</font>

258
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,112
<font color=#FFFF00>He never had to...</font>

259
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:07,172
<font color=#FFFF00>pick up a needle in his whole life.</font>

260
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:09,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Teach him nice and slowly.</font>

261
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Master. Calm down.</font>

262
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:14,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew what he's made of when he stole my suit...</font>

263
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:15,712
<font color=#FFFF00>during the competition.</font>

264
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:17,772
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the worst kind of human being ever.</font>

265
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:19,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do this!</font>

266
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Please throw that. Please do.</font>

267
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:24,272
<font color=#FFFF00>The second you do, I'll call Dong Jin.</font>

268
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:26,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you're out. Throw that right now.</font>

269
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:32,612
<font color=#FFFF00>You're infuriating.</font>

270
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,312
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been getting annoyed really easily.</font>

271
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Something seems to be bothering him.</font>

272
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something going on?</font>

273
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really know.</font>

274
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:46,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Wear it properly, okay?</font>

275
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:48,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello!</font>

276
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,212
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. - You seem busy.</font>

277
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:51,712
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a nice day. - You, too.</font>

278
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,512
<font color=#FFFF00>That view seems oddly familiar.</font>

279
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's this?</font>

280
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,012
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the oil lady.</font>

281
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:12,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo.</font>

282
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:14,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

283
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:16,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you think I'm here?</font>

284
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here for you, the woman who took my money.</font>

285
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:21,512
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a huge misunderstanding.</font>

286
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,142
<font color=#FFFF00>A misunderstanding? Whatever.</font>

287
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get you today.</font>

288
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:28,812
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me. - Hey!</font>

289
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,842
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop right there! - No way!</font>

290
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:33,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop that thief!</font>

291
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,142
<font color=#FFFF00>She took my money! Stop her!</font>

292
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:39,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop that thief! Stop her!</font>

293
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:41,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Get her!</font>

294
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:43,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Save me! - She's a thief!</font>

295
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of the way! A mad woman's after me.</font>

296
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Make way.</font>

297
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:48,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop thief!</font>

298
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:49,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop that thief!</font>

299
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Move, move.</font>

300
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,342
<font color=#FFFF00>That thief.</font>

301
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry. Sorry.</font>

302
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you move?</font>

303
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of the way.</font>

304
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:01,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Oil lady.</font>

305
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:05,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Oil lady!</font>

306
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Oil lady...</font>

307
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wasted a great opportunity. Just my luck.</font>

308
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:13,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Oil lady!</font>

309
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Oil lady!</font>

310
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Your CEO asked to see me.</font>

311
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Lee Dong Sook, Sung Tae Pyung's manager.</font>

312
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,142
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just a moment, please. - Sure.</font>

313
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does she want to see me?</font>

314
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:36,072
<font color=#FFFF00>(Sung Tae Pyung)</font>

315
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,842
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Yeon Jun, CEO)</font>

316
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Ma'am.</font>

317
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome.</font>

318
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Jun... Sorry, Tae Pyung know you're here?</font>

319
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:59,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me not to tell him, so I didn't.</font>

320
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:00,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Well done.</font>

321
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,472
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a seat. - Thanks.</font>

322
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to meet you to ask some questions.</font>

323
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

324
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be direct.</font>

325
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,812
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Tae Pyung.</font>

326
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,042
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you dating? - What?</font>

327
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should know, as the CEO.</font>

328
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:28,912
<font color=#FFFF00>My staff say you live under the same roof.</font>

329
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:29,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you two...</font>

330
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:31,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even imply such a thing.</font>

331
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,442
<font color=#FFFF00>No, we aren't dating at all.</font>

332
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:38,082
<font color=#FFFF00>It is true that Tae Pyung lives on the second floor,</font>

333
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,242
<font color=#FFFF00>but that's because we're cousins.</font>

334
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:45,512
<font color=#FFFF00>He's my older cousin.</font>

335
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:47,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I see.</font>

336
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:50,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were dating...</font>

337
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:52,172
<font color=#FFFF00>and that bothered me so much.</font>

338
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,912
<font color=#FFFF00>You're cousins.</font>

339
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:57,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung's working again and trying to...</font>

340
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,372
<font color=#FFFF00>get people to notice him.</font>

341
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Any strange rumours can...</font>

342
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,272
<font color=#FFFF00>ruin someone's career.</font>

343
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:04,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

344
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:07,582
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to worry about that.</font>

345
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:10,242
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is he dating anyone, then? - What?</font>

346
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:11,582
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung, I mean.</font>

347
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Does he have a crush on someone?</font>

348
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

349
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't know.</font>

350
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:25,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe he doesn't at the moment.</font>

351
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:26,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What a relief.</font>

352
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,542
<font color=#FFFF00>That is such good news.</font>

353
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:33,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you think...</font>

354
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,212
<font color=#FFFF00>he isn't dating anyone?</font>

355
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:38,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think it's because of the trauma of a past love?</font>

356
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:39,972
<font color=#FFFF00>The trauma of a past love?</font>

357
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:41,112
<font color=#FFFF00>For example,</font>

358
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:44,512
<font color=#FFFF00>he closed up because his first love went tragically wrong...</font>

359
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:46,582
<font color=#FFFF00>and he never fell in love again.</font>

360
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:47,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Some men are like that.</font>

361
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:51,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm wondering if he's like that.</font>

362
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:54,312
<font color=#FFFF00>He was never married and is still single.</font>

363
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:56,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

364
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:59,672
<font color=#FFFF00>His debut single was "Susanna's Handkerchief".</font>

365
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,212
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about missing a first love.</font>

366
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,082
<font color=#FFFF00>As the singer,</font>

367
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:06,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet he's still wallowing in the past.</font>

368
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:08,512
<font color=#FFFF00>He closed himself up...</font>

369
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,912
<font color=#FFFF00>and cut himself from the outside world.</font>

370
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Like the men in "Architecture 101"...</font>

371
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:15,672
<font color=#FFFF00>or "The Best of Me".</font>

372
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,842
<font color=#FFFF00>He never got over his first love from 15 years ago...</font>

373
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,272
<font color=#FFFF00>and is still unable to fall in love.</font>

374
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:26,512
<font color=#FFFF00>That is so cruel.</font>

375
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,272
<font color=#FFFF00>And so romantic.</font>

376
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:33,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she crying because she talked about movies?</font>

377
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:38,212
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't look like it, but she's quite silly.</font>

378
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

379
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:49,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I was headed to the store...</font>

380
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:52,112
<font color=#FFFF00>but came here instead, thinking you'd be off work.</font>

381
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Is no one at home?</font>

382
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:55,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Neither me...</font>

383
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,772
<font color=#FFFF00>or my in-laws want to talk to you, so please go away.</font>

384
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:01,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry for everything.</font>

385
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:07,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I know an apology is hardly enough,</font>

386
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,082
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'd feel so bad if I didn't even apologise.</font>

387
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I came here on purpose.</font>

388
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I also bought this.</font>

389
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:16,582
<font color=#FFFF00>1.2kg of meat.</font>

390
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:19,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Make some soup for your family.</font>

391
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:22,242
<font color=#FFFF00>No thanks. Take it and leave.</font>

392
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,042
<font color=#FFFF00>You can ignore my apology,</font>

393
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:26,412
<font color=#FFFF00>but take the meat and eat it.</font>

394
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take Gi Pyo...</font>

395
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,512
<font color=#FFFF00>back to Anseong with me.</font>

396
00:20:30,842 --> 00:20:32,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you worry.</font>

397
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:36,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry for being so rude...</font>

398
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,742
<font color=#FFFF00>in the name of being an in-law.</font>

399
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you forget about it...</font>

400
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:43,082
<font color=#FFFF00>and live happily ever after.</font>

401
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:46,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll find Gi Pyo...</font>

402
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:49,242
<font color=#FFFF00>a nice young woman...</font>

403
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,082
<font color=#FFFF00>and marry him off soon.</font>

404
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:55,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm off. Take care.</font>

405
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:20,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me the truth.</font>

406
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really okay with my returning to Meesa Appareal?</font>

407
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:26,672
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're even the slightest bit upset or bothered by it,</font>

408
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:28,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't go.</font>

409
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you decide to go?</font>

410
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:35,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I just feel like it would bother you.</font>

411
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:37,642
<font color=#FFFF00>My calling with respect to Meesa is important too,</font>

412
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:40,112
<font color=#FFFF00>but you are much more important to me.</font>

413
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine, so it's okay.</font>

414
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:44,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean it?</font>

415
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:49,912
<font color=#FFFF00>But what if Min Hyo Sang makes life difficult for you?</font>

416
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:55,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried that he'll hold a grudge and take it out on you.</font>

417
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:59,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Look. Yun Shil.</font>

418
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:04,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Hong Gi Pyo went to see Hyo Sang.</font>

419
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,412
<font color=#FFFF00>He said if he didn't reinstate me as CEO,</font>

420
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:11,172
<font color=#FFFF00>he'd play the recording of Hyo Sang regarding the fake label incident...</font>

421
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:13,072
<font color=#FFFF00>at the shareholders meeting.</font>

422
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:15,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would he do that?</font>

423
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:18,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he wanted to help me become CEO...</font>

424
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:22,672
<font color=#FFFF00>and in a way, make up to you for his wrongdoings.</font>

425
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Dong Jin.</font>

426
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I have too many documents to look over.</font>

427
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:39,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to have to work late.</font>

428
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to have dinner with you. Sorry.</font>

429
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,772
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

430
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:46,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you had dinner yet?</font>

431
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,342
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't have a proper lunch, either.</font>

432
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:51,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I can eat something quick when I get a chance. Don't worry.</font>

433
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:54,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't skip dinner because I'm not there. Eat a full meal, okay?</font>

434
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:57,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I will. Good luck with your work.</font>

435
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to see Mr Lee Dong Jin.</font>

436
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have an appointment?</font>

437
00:23:23,472 --> 00:23:26,812
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm his wife.</font>

438
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to bring him some food.</font>

439
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:33,542
<font color=#FFFF00>You're his wife? Hello, Madam.</font>

440
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

441
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:43,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give me a minute. I'll call his office.</font>

442
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

443
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:51,572
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

444
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:53,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to see Dong Jin.</font>

445
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you wanted to hear the workers call you "Madam".</font>

446
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:04,512
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

447
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:07,342
<font color=#FFFF00>The office is not your playground.</font>

448
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:11,512
<font color=#FFFF00>You're distracting him from his work, so don't stop by as you wish,</font>

449
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:13,942
<font color=#FFFF00>trying to play house, and just go home.</font>

450
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:15,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Lee Dong Jin's wife.</font>

451
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:20,512
<font color=#FFFF00>You are nothing to him now, so I don't need to take that from you.</font>

452
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:22,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Why am I nothing?</font>

453
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:24,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin and I...</font>

454
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:32,642
<font color=#FFFF00>You know nothing about Dong Jin and me.</font>

455
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:37,342
<font color=#FFFF00>We share many things that you know nothing about.</font>

456
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:43,212
<font color=#FFFF00>You should stop before you look any more pathetic.</font>

457
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:44,312
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

458
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:47,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin has no feelings toward you,</font>

459
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,072
<font color=#FFFF00>so leave my man alone.</font>

460
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:51,372
<font color=#FFFF00>"My man"?</font>

461
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

462
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:55,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

463
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:01,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

464
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come all the way here?</font>

465
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,942
<font color=#FFFF00>It sounded like you were too busy to have dinner,</font>

466
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,112
<font color=#FFFF00>so I brought you some food.</font>

467
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:16,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow. My wife is the best.</font>

468
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:20,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, but you'll have to eat without me.</font>

469
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,712
<font color=#FFFF00>My wife brought me food.</font>

470
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she your wife?</font>

471
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:26,872
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. - Hello.</font>

472
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:30,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I wondered why Mr Lee looked so happy.</font>

473
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:33,612
<font color=#FFFF00>It was because you have a wife who brings you food.</font>

474
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:34,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's right.</font>

475
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:38,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have dinner plans with them?</font>

476
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:39,542
<font color=#FFFF00>No, no.</font>

477
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,172
<font color=#FFFF00>We just finished our meeting and were going to grab dinner,</font>

478
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:47,712
<font color=#FFFF00>but I think we should go home and eat with our wives tonight.</font>

479
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Please enjoy your dinner, Mr Lee.</font>

480
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:52,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.</font>

481
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:47,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow. This is a total feast.</font>

482
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,212
<font color=#FFFF00>You brought me dinner because I'm working late. I'm so touched.</font>

483
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:53,042
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be hungry. Go on and eat.</font>

484
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:54,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

485
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:57,112
<font color=#FFFF00>But earlier, in the lobby...</font>

486
00:26:57,572 --> 00:27:01,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I yelled at Min Hyo Joo to stay away from you...</font>

487
00:27:01,512 --> 00:27:04,012
<font color=#FFFF00>because you're my man now.</font>

488
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:05,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really say that?</font>

489
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:09,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I didn't mean to say something like that,</font>

490
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:11,372
<font color=#FFFF00>but I got angry.</font>

491
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:15,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow. My girl is getting bolder and braver.</font>

492
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. I won't be a fool and just take it...</font>

493
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:19,942
<font color=#FFFF00>any longer.</font>

494
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Good. You did well.</font>

495
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:24,242
<font color=#FFFF00>You should always be bold and say what you want.</font>

496
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:26,512
<font color=#FFFF00>But Dong Jin,</font>

497
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:30,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to become someone who is a good match for you.</font>

498
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

499
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:37,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not educated and don't have much to offer.</font>

500
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:41,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm afraid I'll end up embarrassing you.</font>

501
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:43,342
<font color=#FFFF00>That's absurd.</font>

502
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:47,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so proud to have you as my wife.</font>

503
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:48,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ever think that.</font>

504
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:54,372
<font color=#FFFF00>If only I hadn't wasted 10 years because of Gi Pyo,</font>

505
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've been better than I am now.</font>

506
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,712
<font color=#FFFF00>That thought keeps crossing my mind,</font>

507
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,342
<font color=#FFFF00>so I keep getting upset, and feel like it was such a waste.</font>

508
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:05,342
<font color=#FFFF00>What upsets you the most?</font>

509
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:09,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Not going to school.</font>

510
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I liked studying and got good grades.</font>

511
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:16,412
<font color=#FFFF00>But back then, my situation made it impossible...</font>

512
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,742
<font color=#FFFF00>for me to go to college.</font>

513
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:22,412
<font color=#FFFF00>You can always go back to school now.</font>

514
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:25,912
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too late to go back to school now.</font>

515
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:29,012
<font color=#FFFF00>The soup will get cold. You should eat.</font>

516
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:47,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying this...</font>

517
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>because I'm really worried.</font>

518
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:55,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin is a married man. He is legally married to someone else.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

519
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,742
<font color=#FFFF00>He isn't your husband anymore.</font>

520
00:28:57,742 --> 00:28:59,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that.</font>

521
00:28:59,312 --> 00:29:00,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why are you doing this?</font>

522
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand it's out of your control,</font>

523
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,472
<font color=#FFFF00>but you have to let go of him.</font>

524
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:07,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you lecturing me?</font>

525
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:08,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not lecturing you.</font>

526
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:12,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just worried, that's all. Sorry, if I offended you.</font>

527
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>True.</font>

528
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:20,212
<font color=#FFFF00>You saw me get insulted by my ex-husband's new wife,</font>

529
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:22,372
<font color=#FFFF00>so you must think I'm pathetic.</font>

530
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I do not. You're not pathetic at all.</font>

531
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:27,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm upset because I understand how you feel,</font>

532
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:29,912
<font color=#FFFF00>and it breaks my heart.</font>

533
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:35,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You were always like that.</font>

534
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:38,912
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you understood me,</font>

535
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:41,072
<font color=#FFFF00>and stuck next to me although I told you to go.</font>

536
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:43,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What could a little kid like you know?</font>

537
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:47,512
<font color=#FFFF00>That's because I really did understand how you feel.</font>

538
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:49,872
<font color=#FFFF00>And I still do.</font>

539
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you resent me...</font>

540
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:54,812
<font color=#FFFF00>for kicking out your family?</font>

541
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Seeing Mum suffer in the tiny house,</font>

542
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I did resent you for a moment.</font>

543
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,912
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

544
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:11,712
<font color=#FFFF00>you were hurt and suffered ever since you were little...</font>

545
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,642
<font color=#FFFF00>because of us.</font>

546
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I were in your situation,</font>

547
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I probably would've hated my family, too.</font>

548
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:26,072
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I always...</font>

549
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:28,512
<font color=#FFFF00>feel sorry toward you.</font>

550
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:32,772
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I was even meaner to you.</font>

551
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:37,772
<font color=#FFFF00>If you had fought back like Hyo Sang,</font>

552
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:39,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've just ignored you.</font>

553
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:43,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I really...</font>

554
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:46,542
<font color=#FFFF00>sorry toward you...</font>

555
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:50,672
<font color=#FFFF00>and I sincerely like you.</font>

556
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Is your mum still having a tough time?</font>

557
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:56,872
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because she can't adapt to the situation,</font>

558
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,142
<font color=#FFFF00>but she'll get better soon.</font>

559
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:00,872
<font color=#FFFF00>How about you?</font>

560
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm neither well nor bad.</font>

561
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:08,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I'd feel relieved once your family left,</font>

562
00:31:10,142 --> 00:31:11,312
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was wrong.</font>

563
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad.</font>

564
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,872
<font color=#FFFF00>If you said it was nice and comfortable...</font>

565
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,512
<font color=#FFFF00>because we were gone,</font>

566
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:19,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I would've been upset and hurt.</font>

567
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:46,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how long I've been looking for you?</font>

568
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,442
<font color=#FFFF00>After I practically abandoned you in the US...</font>

569
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:51,242
<font color=#FFFF00>and came to Korea alone,</font>

570
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I was struggling so much with the guilt.</font>

571
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I've forgotten the past, so you don't need to bring it up.</font>

572
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I suffered a lot from a panic disorder after that.</font>

573
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm still on medication.</font>

574
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,542
<font color=#FFFF00>My father finally gave in, after seeing me...</font>

575
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,412
<font color=#FFFF00>unable to get my life together.</font>

576
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:09,342
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why he started the company for me.</font>

577
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:11,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's start over.</font>

578
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,872
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I was too young back then.</font>

579
00:32:13,872 --> 00:32:16,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't betray you this time. I swear.</font>

580
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:18,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't give up this time. I'm confident.</font>

581
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:20,872
<font color=#FFFF00>So please give me a chance.</font>

582
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,542
<font color=#FFFF00>She abandoned me...</font>

583
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,312
<font color=#FFFF00>and now, she says...</font>

584
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:30,512
<font color=#FFFF00>nothing has changed?</font>

585
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:34,512
<font color=#FFFF00>She is just as thoughtless as she used to be.</font>

586
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Where were you? I couldn't reach you.</font>

587
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:42,372
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is...</font>

588
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:46,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I just met with a friend.</font>

589
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:58,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, I'm home.</font>

590
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:00,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what happened...</font>

591
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you feel sick?</font>

592
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,072
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm fine.</font>

593
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,942
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not fine.</font>

594
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you crying?</font>

595
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:15,042
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

596
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:16,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen?</font>

597
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,242
<font color=#FFFF00>No, nothing.</font>

598
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- Then what is it? - Just.</font>

599
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:24,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Life is just so meaningless.</font>

600
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:27,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is life meaningless?</font>

601
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at me.</font>

602
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:34,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you cause trouble again?</font>

603
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:37,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get a notice to pay back a loan you guaranteed again?</font>

604
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:39,042
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I told you, it's nothing.</font>

605
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:41,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why are you like this?</font>

606
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I received...</font>

607
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:46,772
<font color=#FFFF00>a death sentence.</font>

608
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:48,912
<font color=#FFFF00>A death sentence?</font>

609
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:52,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Bae Sam Do received a death sentence as a man.</font>

610
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:54,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I've hit menopause.</font>

611
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:56,842
<font color=#FFFF00>My testosterone level had dropped substantially.</font>

612
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that all?</font>

613
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:01,842
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not the only one hitting menopause! So am I.</font>

614
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:03,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm always getting hot flashes...</font>

615
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,372
<font color=#FFFF00>and sweating.</font>

616
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Does everything annoy you to no end?</font>

617
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:08,982
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

618
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:12,242
<font color=#FFFF00>It isn't just you, so don't be down.</font>

619
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:15,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. My honey.</font>

620
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:20,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Menopause...</font>

621
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:23,312
<font color=#FFFF00>is nothing, so don't let it get you down.</font>

622
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:26,642
<font color=#FFFF00>What a waste of your looks.</font>

623
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:28,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Had I known,</font>

624
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:32,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've worked hard on our homework when you asked.</font>

625
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:37,542
<font color=#FFFF00>It isn't too late yet.</font>

626
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Be confident, Mr Bae Sam Do.</font>

627
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:40,912
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

628
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,042
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too late for me now.</font>

629
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Rivers are meant to be crossed,</font>

630
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,112
<font color=#FFFF00>and menopause is meant to be overcome.</font>

631
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:53,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's start our "overcome menopause project" tomorrow.</font>

632
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:57,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome menopause project?</font>

633
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:01,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Go, go!</font>

634
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:09,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

635
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have a good day?</font>

636
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:24,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you wait long?</font>

637
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,672
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

638
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,572
<font color=#FFFF00>You did, too.</font>

639
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Your cheeks are frozen.</font>

640
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:33,542
<font color=#FFFF00>- Should I not wait any more? - No.</font>

641
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:37,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I love having you pick me up at the bus stop.</font>

642
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:48,312
<font color=#FFFF00>How was your first day back?</font>

643
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:50,512
<font color=#FFFF00>It was good.</font>

644
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:52,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Memories of when we first met...</font>

645
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:55,712
<font color=#FFFF00>and our working together kept coming back to me.</font>

646
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:58,312
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I'm reminded of those times, too.</font>

647
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:01,342
<font color=#FFFF00>What was your first impression of me...</font>

648
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:03,172
<font color=#FFFF00>when we met?</font>

649
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Min.</font>

650
00:36:11,812 --> 00:36:13,642
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a new hire.</font>

651
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:16,842
<font color=#FFFF00>He was assigned to your team, so I wanted to introduce him.</font>

652
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:18,642
<font color=#FFFF00>A new hire?</font>

653
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:24,242
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

654
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:26,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is that man here?</font>

655
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:28,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I just told you.</font>

656
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:30,812
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a new hire who was assigned to your team.</font>

657
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, I'm Kang Tae Yang.</font>

658
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,442
<font color=#FFFF00>You were very frightening.</font>

659
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:39,772
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

660
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Just kidding.</font>

661
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,072
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

662
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,512
<font color=#FFFF00>isn't it hard commuting by mass transportation?</font>

663
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:50,512
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

664
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I like taking the bus. I get to exercise.</font>

665
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:55,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

666
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:57,842
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll be hard, commuting by bus...</font>

667
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,172
<font color=#FFFF00>when it gets packed.</font>

668
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:02,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd better make money quickly and buy you a car.</font>

669
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Your thoughtfulness alone is making me happy.</font>

670
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do it, so just wait.</font>

671
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:12,672
<font color=#FFFF00>But Hyo Won...</font>

672
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:16,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you should take special care of your mother.</font>

673
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:20,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I stopped by earlier to see her,</font>

674
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,312
<font color=#FFFF00>and she wasn't eating...</font>

675
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:24,412
<font color=#FFFF00>and was chewing on ice.</font>

676
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,512
<font color=#FFFF00>It's probably because she's frustrated.</font>

677
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,912
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll hurt her teeth and her health.</font>

678
00:37:29,572 --> 00:37:31,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you'll be tired too,</font>

679
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:34,042
<font color=#FFFF00>but I think you should pay special attention to her.</font>

680
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I will.</font>

681
00:37:42,112 --> 00:37:43,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Ji Yun move in yet?</font>

682
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:44,942
<font color=#FFFF00>No, not yet.</font>

683
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:49,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand it's frustrating for her,</font>

684
00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:52,042
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm worried that she'll abandon my brother...</font>

685
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:53,742
<font color=#FFFF00>and never come back.</font>

686
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:56,112
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll be back soon, so don't worry.</font>

687
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,482
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm home.</font>

688
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. You'll make yourself sick.</font>

689
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:14,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm burning up inside. I can't stand it. Give it back.</font>

690
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:16,212
<font color=#FFFF00>No. Tae Yang said...</font>

691
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:18,512
<font color=#FFFF00>to make sure you don't chew on ice.</font>

692
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:21,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is he to say anything?</font>

693
00:38:21,942 --> 00:38:23,742
<font color=#FFFF00>He said if you chew on ice on an empty stomach,</font>

694
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:26,012
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll get a stomachache and damage your teeth.</font>

695
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how much he worries about you?</font>

696
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,612
<font color=#FFFF00>If he's so worried,</font>

697
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:34,512
<font color=#FFFF00>tell him to break up with you.</font>

698
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,712
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mum! - Oh my gosh.</font>

699
00:38:36,342 --> 00:38:37,742
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you yell at me?</font>

700
00:38:37,742 --> 00:38:40,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be like that to him You can't do that.</font>

701
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:41,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be like what?</font>

702
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:43,772
<font color=#FFFF00>What does that punk have to offer?</font>

703
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,612
<font color=#FFFF00>This house...</font>

704
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang paid for it.</font>

705
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:51,982
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

706
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:54,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang used the money he got from shooting that commercial...</font>

707
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:55,712
<font color=#FFFF00>and got us this place...</font>

708
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,072
<font color=#FFFF00>and told me not to tell you.</font>

709
00:38:58,812 --> 00:39:00,412
<font color=#FFFF00>He said you'd feel bad and refuse.</font>

710
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,272
<font color=#FFFF00>He is so thoughtful of you.</font>

711
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:04,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

712
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:13,982
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

713
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:17,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm getting handouts from my daughter's boyfriend.</font>

714
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:20,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Ko Eun Sook,</font>

715
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:22,642
<font color=#FFFF00>your life has hit rock bottom.</font>

716
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:25,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. Why are you saying that?</font>

717
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:27,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Your future son-in-law helped his wife's family.</font>

718
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Just be grateful and pay him back later.</font>

719
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:31,612
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not my future son-in-law.</font>

720
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:33,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness.</font>

721
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:36,742
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the use in living like this?</font>

722
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, take me away...</font>

723
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,072
<font color=#FFFF00>from this life.</font>

724
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:47,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't live like this.</font>

725
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:49,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm burning up.</font>

726
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:51,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

727
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it already.</font>

728
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Miss.</font>

729
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:12,312
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't forget...</font>

730
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:14,642
<font color=#FFFF00>that I need to go down to visit my family...</font>

731
00:40:14,642 --> 00:40:16,172
<font color=#FFFF00>for a few days, did you?</font>

732
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:18,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that tomorrow?</font>

733
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'm leaving early in the morning.</font>

734
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:23,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I already bought my tickets.</font>

735
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:26,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Thank you.</font>

736
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:37,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow. My wife is the best.</font>

737
00:40:37,512 --> 00:40:40,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, but you'll have to eat without me.</font>

738
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:43,742
<font color=#FFFF00>My wife brought me food.</font>

739
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:54,542
<font color=#FFFF00>We're home.</font>

740
00:40:55,772 --> 00:40:56,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh.</font>

741
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,312
<font color=#FFFF00>The house feels so empty...</font>

742
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:00,772
<font color=#FFFF00>without Mum and Dad.</font>

743
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:02,942
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go to Gangneung this weekend, right?</font>

744
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:06,412
<font color=#FFFF00>The company is in a state of emergency,</font>

745
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:07,772
<font color=#FFFF00>so I'm not sure.</font>

746
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:11,142
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're too busy, I'll just go by myself.</font>

747
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried...</font>

748
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:14,612
<font color=#FFFF00>and feel too uneasy.</font>

749
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:16,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make some time.</font>

750
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:19,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Go inside. I should make a phone call to Dad.</font>

751
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:20,982
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

752
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:35,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

753
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:38,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. How are you?</font>

754
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:39,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

755
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:43,542
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not so cold, so I'm taking a walk in the yard.</font>

756
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:46,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Is everyone doing all right?</font>

757
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Don't worry about us.</font>

758
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,712
<font color=#FFFF00>The sea breeze is cold at night, so don't stay outside for long.</font>

759
00:41:52,712 --> 00:41:55,112
<font color=#FFFF00>It's warmer here than Seoul. Don't worry.</font>

760
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,412
<font color=#FFFF00>- How is Mum? - She's sleeping like a log.</font>

761
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,842
<font color=#FFFF00>She was following me all day.</font>

762
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:03,172
<font color=#FFFF00>She must be tired.</font>

763
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,342
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not familiar with the surroundings yet.</font>

764
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:07,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you go out with Mum.</font>

765
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I talked about a newly wedded life and it became true.</font>

766
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:15,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mum wouldn't stay away from me.</font>

767
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:18,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so glad that you are together.</font>

768
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>It was my first day at Meesa Apparel.</font>

769
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Good for you.</font>

770
00:42:23,242 --> 00:42:27,012
<font color=#FFFF00>It must not be easy. Brace yourself.</font>

771
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:29,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dong Jin. - Yes.</font>

772
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:32,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you'll do all right,</font>

773
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:36,612
<font color=#FFFF00>but make sure not to hurt anyone's feelings.</font>

774
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:41,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. I learned that from you while I worked at the tailor shop...</font>

775
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,012
<font color=#FFFF00>that it's all about people whether I work at the shop or in the company.</font>

776
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:45,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about it.</font>

777
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:48,772
<font color=#FFFF00>The guild with Tonelli...</font>

778
00:42:48,772 --> 00:42:50,372
<font color=#FFFF00>is going along nicely.</font>

779
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:53,742
<font color=#FFFF00>They are all your acquaintances,</font>

780
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:55,872
<font color=#FFFF00>so I will do my best not to cause you any trouble.</font>

781
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:58,612
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I trust you.</font>

782
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:02,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be tired after your first day. Take a rest.</font>

783
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:05,042
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You take a rest, too, Dad.</font>

784
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Enjoy your newlywed life.</font>

785
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:08,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. Bye.</font>

786
00:43:24,442 --> 00:43:26,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be 80 years old soon.</font>

787
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm having a newlywed life in such an old age.</font>

788
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,942
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't be as sweet as before when we were young,</font>

789
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:38,412
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm so thankful...</font>

790
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:40,912
<font color=#FFFF00>for the quiet and warm days.</font>

791
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:44,272
<font color=#FFFF00>As the lamp shines at the dark night,</font>

792
00:43:44,812 --> 00:43:48,712
<font color=#FFFF00>the life is both sad and happy.</font>

793
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:54,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I should appreciate that I can grow old with my good wife.</font>

794
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:16,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do we have to come to the park in such an early morning?</font>

795
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you.</font>

796
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:21,072
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll start the project to overcome menopause.</font>

797
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:24,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the assistant instructor, and you're the recruit.</font>

798
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:26,742
<font color=#FFFF00>We should harden our heart and overcome menopause.</font>

799
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:29,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Was that why we're here? I'll go back home.</font>

800
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:32,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this?</font>

801
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:35,742
<font color=#FFFF00>People live up to 100 years these days. They say 9988234.</font>

802
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,372
<font color=#FFFF00>We should live youthfully until 99 years old,</font>

803
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:38,572
<font color=#FFFF00>and suffer 2 or 3 days and die.</font>

804
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:41,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to stagger when you're only 50 years old?</font>

805
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I don't.</font>

806
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:45,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Then we should make an excruciating effort...</font>

807
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:47,342
<font color=#FFFF00>to overcome this.</font>

808
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:49,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Repeat after me. I can do it!</font>

809
00:44:50,642 --> 00:44:52,042
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can do it. - Good.</font>

810
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:55,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's start with walking up the stairs.</font>

811
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:57,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I walk up that stairs?</font>

812
00:44:57,342 --> 00:44:58,712
<font color=#FFFF00>- Go! - All right.</font>

813
00:44:58,942 --> 00:44:59,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Go.</font>

814
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,812
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, you're also menopausal. Why am I the only one doing this?</font>

815
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:04,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I usually walk around 20,000 steps a day...</font>

816
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:06,742
<font color=#FFFF00>receiving deposits on dispatch.</font>

817
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:09,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need more exercise. Run, Bae Sam Do!</font>

818
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:11,972
<font color=#FFFF00>That hurts my ears. All right. Wait a second.</font>

819
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:14,242
<font color=#FFFF00>When I run...</font>

820
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,772
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, I'm ready.</font>

821
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:18,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You're handsome.</font>

822
00:45:22,642 --> 00:45:24,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go with all your might!</font>

823
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:28,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Go! Go!</font>

824
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey, take this! - All right.</font>

825
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:36,312
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can do it! - I can do it!</font>

826
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do it!</font>

827
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:45,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go!</font>

828
00:45:47,342 --> 00:45:48,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Again!</font>

829
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:00,842
<font color=#FFFF00>One, two!</font>

830
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:05,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How was it?</font>

831
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:08,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Rather than dwelling on your own misfortune,</font>

832
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:11,772
<font color=#FFFF00>exercising outside must make you feel much better.</font>

833
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:15,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel better, but I can't breathe.</font>

834
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:21,112
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can do it! - I can do it.</font>

835
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Good.</font>

836
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on? Did you do morning exercise?</font>

837
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:30,312
<font color=#FFFF00>It was rather a training than an exercise.</font>

838
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:31,872
<font color=#FFFF00>A training? What do you mean?</font>

839
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:34,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ask in detail. Curiosity kills the cat.</font>

840
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:38,042
<font color=#FFFF00>- Go inside and have breakfast. - Can we?</font>

841
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,842
<font color=#FFFF00>The house feels empty without Mum and Dad.</font>

842
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:42,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get together and have meals together.</font>

843
00:46:42,612 --> 00:46:45,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's eat together starting today.</font>

844
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:48,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Then we should take turns cooking.</font>

845
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sam Do. - Yes.</font>

846
00:46:53,512 --> 00:46:56,112
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of exercise did you do? It seems that your legs are rubbery.</font>

847
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:58,072
<font color=#FFFF00>It was not an exercise. It was a training.</font>

848
00:46:58,112 --> 00:46:59,842
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't catch my drift.</font>

849
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:01,742
<font color=#FFFF00>A training?</font>

850
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:03,572
<font color=#FFFF00>He's funny.</font>

851
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:14,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Are we that poor? I don't like the side dishes.</font>

852
00:47:14,912 --> 00:47:16,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop being childish.</font>

853
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,712
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not in a position to complain about the food.</font>

854
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You scold me whenever I say something.</font>

855
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,072
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

856
00:47:28,272 --> 00:47:30,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this bean sprout soup or salt soup?</font>

857
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:34,512
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so salty.</font>

858
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,712
<font color=#FFFF00>You put too much salt.</font>

859
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:39,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't put that much salt.</font>

860
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:51,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I let the housekeeper take charge of the kitchen all along.</font>

861
00:47:52,772 --> 00:47:54,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't cooked for a long time.</font>

862
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:56,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have lost the sense of cooking.</font>

863
00:47:56,742 --> 00:47:58,472
<font color=#FFFF00>You never had the touch.</font>

864
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,142
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have a natural sense.</font>

865
00:48:00,372 --> 00:48:01,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not supposed to complain about me.</font>

866
00:48:01,972 --> 00:48:04,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are we having such a hard time in this house?</font>

867
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:06,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. Stop it.</font>

868
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:09,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you yelling in the morning?</font>

869
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:10,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know...</font>

870
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:15,012
<font color=#FFFF00>it's the anniversary of Dad's death?</font>

871
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:18,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it the anniversary of Dad's death?</font>

872
00:48:18,012 --> 00:48:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. I forgot as I was so busy nowadays.</font>

873
00:48:23,412 --> 00:48:26,172
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do with Ji Yun on such a day?</font>

874
00:48:26,272 --> 00:48:29,272
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the first time for her to commemorate her father-in-law.</font>

875
00:48:29,372 --> 00:48:32,942
<font color=#FFFF00>If she won't come, does it mean that she would break up with you?</font>

876
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll call her. - She's so mean.</font>

877
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:40,072
<font color=#FFFF00>She should stay by her husband when he's having a hard time.</font>

878
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:41,712
<font color=#FFFF00>How could she run away?</font>

879
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:44,412
<font color=#FFFF00>She lacks common sense.</font>

880
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:47,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you...</font>

881
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:49,672
<font color=#FFFF00>finishing your meal?</font>

882
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:51,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I had enough.</font>

883
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:56,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - Stop it, Mum.</font>

884
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:59,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to say that when he's already distressed?</font>

885
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:02,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have let him marry Ji Yun.</font>

886
00:49:02,312 --> 00:49:05,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have disapproved that marriage.</font>

887
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:08,442
<font color=#FFFF00>How unfortunate I am!</font>

888
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:09,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so upset.</font>

889
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to see whether you're doing fine.</font>

890
00:49:37,072 --> 00:49:39,172
<font color=#FFFF00>How is everything?</font>

891
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:41,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

892
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:43,812
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to be sorry.</font>

893
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:46,872
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault.</font>

894
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Life is so turbulent.</font>

895
00:49:50,312 --> 00:49:52,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to do.</font>

896
00:49:53,112 --> 00:49:54,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't feel calm.</font>

897
00:49:57,212 --> 00:49:59,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm such a bad woman.</font>

898
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:00,872
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

899
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:03,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I can understand your situation.</font>

900
00:50:08,912 --> 00:50:11,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you really decided to work in the tailor shop?</font>

901
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:15,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, it turned out that way.</font>

902
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:16,212
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nonsense.</font>

903
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:19,112
<font color=#FFFF00>That's too harsh.</font>

904
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:23,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I appointed Dong Jin to the warehouse to dismiss him,</font>

905
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:26,442
<font color=#FFFF00>and finally made him work in the tailor shop.</font>

906
00:50:26,442 --> 00:50:29,472
<font color=#FFFF00>But you don't have any experience doing such work.</font>

907
00:50:30,212 --> 00:50:33,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he taking revenge on you? That's too much.</font>

908
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:36,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin wouldn't do such a thing.</font>

909
00:50:37,342 --> 00:50:39,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm reaping the fruits of my actions.</font>

910
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:41,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have any other choice?</font>

911
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:47,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I have nothing to do except wishing that Doing Jin would...</font>

912
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:51,812
<font color=#FFFF00>bring the company back to normal, and work in the tailor shop.</font>

913
00:50:52,772 --> 00:50:54,542
<font color=#FFFF00>If Dong Jin fails,</font>

914
00:50:55,112 --> 00:50:57,442
<font color=#FFFF00>there's no other hope.</font>

915
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the anniversary of Dad's death today.</font>

916
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:07,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mean to pressure you.</font>

917
00:51:07,472 --> 00:51:11,412
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you have any thought of being with me,</font>

918
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:14,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you to come for the anniversary today.</font>

919
00:51:15,812 --> 00:51:17,512
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't show up,</font>

920
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:19,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take it to mean we're separating.</font>

921
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:21,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang.</font>

922
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever you decide,</font>

923
00:51:24,312 --> 00:51:27,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I will respect your decision.</font>

924
00:51:28,972 --> 00:51:31,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you curse me a lot on the inside?</font>

925
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:36,372
<font color=#FFFF00>As you know, I'm mean and have a horrid temper.</font>

926
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:40,472
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only person I open up to...</font>

927
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:42,212
<font color=#FFFF00>and manage to understand.</font>

928
00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:47,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's hard on you, so don't worry.</font>

929
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go.</font>

930
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:01,642
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

931
00:52:01,712 --> 00:52:02,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

932
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:04,412
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a great day. - Thanks.</font>

933
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,412
<font color=#FFFF00>One more thing.</font>

934
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:08,472
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our new fire insurance.</font>

935
00:52:08,472 --> 00:52:09,742
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a look. - Okay.</font>

936
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:11,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- See you tomorrow. - Bye.</font>

937
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:14,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you give me a two-dollar discount?</font>

938
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:16,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have that much cash.</font>

939
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:18,542
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who's that? - Give me a discount.</font>

940
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:20,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I already took three dollars off.</font>

941
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:22,342
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't ask for more than that.</font>

942
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:24,812
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why are you so stingy? - Lady.</font>

943
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't make much as it is.</font>

944
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:29,272
<font color=#FFFF00>How can an octopus cost as much as 50 dollars?</font>

945
00:52:30,342 --> 00:52:33,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take two dollars more off. - Then take the small one.</font>

946
00:52:33,372 --> 00:52:36,142
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for my husband's death anniversary service.</font>

947
00:52:36,312 --> 00:52:37,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you take two dollars off?</font>

948
00:52:37,642 --> 00:52:39,742
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness. - No?</font>

949
00:52:39,742 --> 00:52:41,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- Madam Ko. - Gosh.</font>

950
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:44,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

951
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:46,272
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's been a while. - It has.</font>

952
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:48,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd heard you'd moved to the neighbourhood,</font>

953
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:50,442
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was too busy to visit.</font>

954
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:52,342
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you feel?</font>

955
00:52:52,772 --> 00:52:54,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Much better now.</font>

956
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:58,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you tutting?</font>

957
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:02,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You used to be so elegant and haughty.</font>

958
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:05,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Who'd have thought you'd end up crouching in a market like this...</font>

959
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:06,742
<font color=#FFFF00>haggling over the price of an octopus?</font>

960
00:53:07,072 --> 00:53:09,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Lives change in the blink of an eye.</font>

961
00:53:11,472 --> 00:53:13,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you buy it or not?</font>

962
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I will if you give me two more dollars off.</font>

963
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:16,612
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - No?</font>

964
00:53:17,012 --> 00:53:19,442
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't. - I'll give you the two dollars.</font>

965
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:20,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Buy the octopus.</font>

966
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:22,442
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine.</font>

967
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:24,072
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not fine.</font>

968
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:26,012
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to feel bad.</font>

969
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,072
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can you wash it, please? - Goodness.</font>

970
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't feel bad over just two dollars.</font>

971
00:53:31,972 --> 00:53:33,872
<font color=#FFFF00>- You take it. - Thank you.</font>

972
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:36,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Unbelievable.</font>

973
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:41,412
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the 2017 fall season collection suit.</font>

974
00:53:41,412 --> 00:53:43,512
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think? - This is amazing.</font>

975
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,472
<font color=#FFFF00>It's like looking at a manica camicia textbook.</font>

976
00:53:47,342 --> 00:53:48,742
<font color=#FFFF00>He really likes it.</font>

977
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:52,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Asians have smaller shoulders compared to westerners.</font>

978
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,512
<font color=#FFFF00>A slim fit poses no problems,</font>

979
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:57,242
<font color=#FFFF00>but our shoulders are more rounded.</font>

980
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:59,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead of using shoulder pads,</font>

981
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,872
<font color=#FFFF00>we used a thicker lining...</font>

982
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:02,642
<font color=#FFFF00>for a more active fit.</font>

983
00:54:02,642 --> 00:54:05,712
<font color=#FFFF00>The details are extremely creative.</font>

984
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:07,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Good job.</font>

985
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:08,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, thank you.</font>

986
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:09,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You know, with your skill,</font>

987
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:14,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure the proud tailors at Tonelli studios...</font>

988
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:16,042
<font color=#FFFF00>will have nothing to complain about.</font>

989
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:17,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you, come here.</font>

990
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:20,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Does "good job" mean something nice?</font>

991
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:22,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it does.</font>

992
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:23,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a huge compliment.</font>

993
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:26,842
<font color=#FFFF00>The design team from Headquarters will be visiting soon...</font>

994
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:30,312
<font color=#FFFF00>to see the new collection and the tailor training.</font>

995
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:33,442
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm sure there won't be anything to worry about.</font>

996
00:54:33,842 --> 00:54:35,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Intern.</font>

997
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have anything to say to him?</font>

998
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:39,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, yes.</font>

999
00:54:39,472 --> 00:54:42,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Our tailors will be forwarded with the details...</font>

1000
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,742
<font color=#FFFF00>and the information about the suits,</font>

1001
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:45,772
<font color=#FFFF00>and we'll make sure to make at least...</font>

1002
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:47,842
<font color=#FFFF00>one prototype for each design so the...</font>

1003
00:54:47,942 --> 00:54:51,412
<font color=#FFFF00>designers at Tonelli can, you know, thoroughly supervise them.</font>

1004
00:54:51,512 --> 00:54:55,172
<font color=#FFFF00>So, from now on, Mr Lee will be leading the company...</font>

1005
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:56,242
<font color=#FFFF00>at Meesa Apparel...</font>

1006
00:54:56,772 --> 00:55:00,312
<font color=#FFFF00>and Mr Min will be managing the Wolgyesu-Tonelli store?</font>

1007
00:55:03,712 --> 00:55:05,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, he's going to be coming back and forth...</font>

1008
00:55:05,842 --> 00:55:07,942
<font color=#FFFF00>until I master the technical parts,</font>

1009
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,072
<font color=#FFFF00>and once I do, I'm going to take charge.</font>

1010
00:55:10,412 --> 00:55:13,042
<font color=#FFFF00>And Mr Bae will be with me by my side,</font>

1011
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,642
<font color=#FFFF00>so there's really nothing to worry about.</font>

1012
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:17,242
<font color=#FFFF00>President.</font>

1013
00:55:18,212 --> 00:55:19,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Master Tailor.</font>

1014
00:55:20,272 --> 00:55:21,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Intern.</font>

1015
00:55:21,612 --> 00:55:23,642
<font color=#FFFF00>We will teach him the skills.</font>

1016
00:55:24,342 --> 00:55:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Starting with how to sew.</font>

1017
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,942
<font color=#FFFF00>And he's his translator.</font>

1018
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:31,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

1019
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:36,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

1020
00:55:40,742 --> 00:55:41,812
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you?</font>

1021
00:55:44,372 --> 00:55:47,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pretend we're chummy. It's awkward.</font>

1022
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:49,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you be nice?</font>

1023
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:51,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

1024
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,542
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Dad's death anniversary.</font>

1025
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum's preparing the service.</font>

1026
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:56,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Come to our place if you can.</font>

1027
00:55:57,712 --> 00:55:58,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should I?</font>

1028
00:55:58,812 --> 00:55:59,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Just come.</font>

1029
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:02,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad will want to see the whole family together.</font>

1030
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:06,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll text you our address. I hope you'll come.</font>

1031
00:56:07,372 --> 00:56:08,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll wait.</font>

1032
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,412
<font color=#FFFF00>You must come.</font>

1033
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Promise.</font>

1034
00:56:25,072 --> 00:56:26,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I know I was preoccupied,</font>

1035
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:28,742
<font color=#FFFF00>but how did I forget that?</font>

1036
00:56:37,472 --> 00:56:38,572
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me.</font>

1037
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:42,442
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my dad's death anniversary...</font>

1038
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,812
<font color=#FFFF00>- and we should prepare... - Ms Min.</font>

1039
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:48,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I'd be visiting my hometown.</font>

1040
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. You did.</font>

1041
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:52,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

1042
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:12,542
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come with me. - Where to?</font>

1043
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:13,772
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll find out.</font>

1044
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry to surprise you. Gi Pyo's...</font>

1045
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:35,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- leaving Seoul today. - So what?</font>

1046
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,642
<font color=#FFFF00>He asked me to let him see you one last time.</font>

1047
00:57:40,412 --> 00:57:42,212
<font color=#FFFF00>- Go and talk to him. - No.</font>

1048
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:45,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not saying you should forgive him.</font>

1049
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:46,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't, either.</font>

1050
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,272
<font color=#FFFF00>But I think you need to end things properly...</font>

1051
00:57:50,272 --> 00:57:52,172
<font color=#FFFF00>if you're to move on...</font>

1052
00:57:52,712 --> 00:57:54,112
<font color=#FFFF00>with a clear conscience.</font>

1053
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Go on.</font>

1054
00:57:57,912 --> 00:58:00,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stand guard from here.</font>

1055
00:58:09,872 --> 00:58:10,872
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while.</font>

1056
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:14,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving Seoul today.</font>

1057
00:58:14,972 --> 00:58:16,742
<font color=#FFFF00>What does that have to do with me?</font>

1058
00:58:16,842 --> 00:58:18,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing, I know.</font>

1059
00:58:18,612 --> 00:58:21,472
<font color=#FFFF00>But I wanted to see you one last time,</font>

1060
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:25,372
<font color=#FFFF00>so I asked Dong Jin for an incredulous favour.</font>

1061
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:30,242
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll never meet again. Don't look at me like that.</font>

1062
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:33,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what you said that made Dong Jin bring me here,</font>

1063
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:34,712
<font color=#FFFF00>but never do it again.</font>

1064
00:58:34,872 --> 00:58:37,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to see you again, even by chance.</font>

1065
00:58:37,742 --> 00:58:38,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought...</font>

1066
00:58:43,342 --> 00:58:45,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I should return this to you.</font>

1067
00:58:46,472 --> 00:58:47,642
<font color=#FFFF00>It's your diary.</font>

1068
00:58:47,842 --> 00:58:49,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I read a few pages. Sorry.</font>

1069
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:56,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for letting me see your face before I go.</font>

1070
00:58:57,572 --> 00:58:59,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry for everything.</font>

1071
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:07,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I should go.</font>

1072
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:11,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Be happy, Yun Shil.</font>

1073
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:31,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for letting me see her.</font>

1074
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:33,672
<font color=#FFFF00>It's to help her get over you.</font>

1075
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

1076
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:38,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep putting her first.</font>

1077
00:59:40,412 --> 00:59:41,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Take...</font>

1078
00:59:41,972 --> 00:59:43,012
<font color=#FFFF00>good care of her.</font>

1079
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:45,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Make her happy.</font>

1080
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:46,912
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to worry about her.</font>

1081
00:59:47,512 --> 00:59:49,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay out of trouble and live an honest life.</font>

1082
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:53,072
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the only way you can ever repay her.</font>

1083
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,012
<font color=#FFFF00>You're horrid to the end.</font>

1084
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:57,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

1085
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:37,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

1086
01:00:39,112 --> 01:00:40,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It was horrific for you...</font>

1087
01:00:43,112 --> 01:00:46,042
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was happy that I was able to love you.</font>

1088
01:00:47,972 --> 01:00:50,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything I say will only sound like an excuse,</font>

1089
01:00:53,712 --> 01:00:56,442
<font color=#FFFF00>but the love I had for you was pure.</font>

1090
01:01:05,312 --> 01:01:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>A few days ago,</font>

1091
01:01:07,412 --> 01:01:10,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to a temple to ask for your dad's forgiveness.</font>

1092
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:13,672
<font color=#FFFF00>That was the only thing I could do.</font>

1093
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:18,012
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

1094
01:01:21,672 --> 01:01:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Father.</font>

1095
01:01:25,472 --> 01:01:26,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

1096
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:31,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided to go far away.</font>

1097
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I will go to sea.</font>

1098
01:01:34,912 --> 01:01:37,312
<font color=#FFFF00>The lies I told to keep you close...</font>

1099
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:39,242
<font color=#FFFF00>ended up driving you away,</font>

1100
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:42,972
<font color=#FFFF00>but I doubt I'll ever be able to forget you.</font>

1101
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:48,472
<font color=#FFFF00>That doesn't mean you'll see me again, so don't worry.</font>

1102
01:01:53,872 --> 01:01:56,272
<font color=#FFFF00>If time passes and you still can't forgive me,</font>

1103
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,642
<font color=#FFFF00>then forget about me.</font>

1104
01:01:59,312 --> 01:02:02,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want you to remember me as a scoundrel.</font>

1105
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:06,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Please be happy, Yun Shil.</font>

1106
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:14,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

1107
01:02:18,712 --> 01:02:20,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Finally, it's all over.</font>

1108
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Well done.</font>

1109
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you call that a line? That'll make a terrible suit.</font>

1110
01:02:32,572 --> 01:02:33,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Draw as if you're...</font>

1111
01:02:33,812 --> 01:02:35,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- drawing on your soul. - Master.</font>

1112
01:02:35,772 --> 01:02:36,812
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1113
01:02:36,812 --> 01:02:38,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- You have a visitor. - Who is it?</font>

1114
01:02:38,642 --> 01:02:41,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think he wants a suit, but he asked to see you.</font>

1115
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:45,112
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder who it is. Ms Geum, if he slacks off, hit him with this.</font>

1116
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:47,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Gosh, this thing...</font>

1117
01:02:49,212 --> 01:02:50,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Please save me.</font>

1118
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,012
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Master!</font>

1119
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't. Okay, I'll do it.</font>

1120
01:02:55,142 --> 01:02:56,542
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will. - Get to work.</font>

1121
01:02:56,742 --> 01:02:58,412
<font color=#FFFF00>- I don't want to hit you. - Don't.</font>

1122
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:00,242
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can do this. - Do it, then.</font>

1123
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:01,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it properly.</font>

1124
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:03,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Just draw.</font>

1125
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:17,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Yong Suk.</font>

1126
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:19,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Yong Suk?</font>

1127
01:03:20,612 --> 01:03:21,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Sam Do.</font>

1128
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:25,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, how long has it been?</font>

1129
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:27,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, Sam Do.</font>

1130
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:31,242
<font color=#FFFF00>How is your health?</font>

1131
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:33,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've called you.</font>

1132
01:03:33,712 --> 01:03:37,542
<font color=#FFFF00>After I went bankrupt, avoiding creditors was my priority.</font>

1133
01:03:38,012 --> 01:03:39,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hate me?</font>

1134
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:42,572
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I just assumed you had your reasons.</font>

1135
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:45,512
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't hate you. I just cursed you a few times.</font>

1136
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I never thought you'd disappear leaving me with your debt.</font>

1137
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:51,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Sam Do.</font>

1138
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:53,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this.</font>

1139
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:57,012
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

1140
01:03:57,012 --> 01:03:58,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that the worst is over,</font>

1141
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:01,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I came by to repay you what I owe.</font>

1142
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I never thought...</font>

1143
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:14,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd ever see this money again.</font>

1144
01:04:15,942 --> 01:04:17,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks so much.</font>

1145
01:04:18,872 --> 01:04:19,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

1146

<font color=#FFFF00>"A Stroll With Music",</font>

1150
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:34,112
<font color=#FFFF00>This is tough.</font>

1151
01:04:34,242 --> 01:04:35,542
<font color=#FFFF00>(CEO)</font>

1152
01:04:41,512 --> 01:04:43,172
<font color=#FFFF00>This is becoming an issue.</font>

1153
01:04:44,912 --> 01:04:47,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I have said I'm married?</font>

1154
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:49,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

1155
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:53,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, come down for dinner.</font>

1156
01:04:53,812 --> 01:04:54,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Da Jeong.</font>

1157
01:04:55,442 --> 01:04:57,672
<font color=#FFFF00>We have meat, your favourite.</font>

1158
01:04:57,672 --> 01:04:59,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hurry up. - Really?</font>

1159
01:04:59,172 --> 01:05:00,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, let's hurry.</font>

1160
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it a special day? Why are we eating meat?</font>

1161
01:05:10,872 --> 01:05:13,012
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our treat.</font>

1162
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:14,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have good news to share?</font>

1163
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:18,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Today, I found some money.</font>

1164
01:05:19,642 --> 01:05:21,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you remember how...</font>

1165
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:25,172
<font color=#FFFF00>we had to repay 50,000 dollars of his friend's debt?</font>

1166
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,612
<font color=#FFFF00>That friend came by today and gave it back.</font>

1167
01:05:28,612 --> 01:05:31,612
<font color=#FFFF00>That's great news. Congratulations.</font>

1168
01:05:31,612 --> 01:05:33,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess there's always a way out.</font>

1169
01:05:33,942 --> 01:05:36,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I never imagined I'd get it back.</font>

1170
01:05:37,442 --> 01:05:40,472
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do with that money?</font>

1171
01:05:40,472 --> 01:05:41,972
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll figure something out.</font>

1172
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,112
<font color=#FFFF00>That is such a happy problem to have.</font>

1173
01:05:46,912 --> 01:05:49,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello? Is anyone home?</font>

1174
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:51,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is someone at the door? - Who's that?</font>

1175
01:05:52,342 --> 01:05:54,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it? Eat up.</font>

1176
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:57,112
<font color=#FFFF00>It's delicious.</font>

1177
01:06:04,572 --> 01:06:06,712
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here, Ms Lee?</font>

1178
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to see Tae Pyung. Is he in?</font>

1179
01:06:08,812 --> 01:06:10,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you want to see him?</font>

1180
01:06:12,012 --> 01:06:13,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Just a moment.</font>

1181
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung. Tae Pyung.</font>

1182
01:06:18,612 --> 01:06:20,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Your CEO's here.</font>

1183
01:06:21,742 --> 01:06:24,242
<font color=#FFFF00>The CEO of your agency?</font>

1184
01:06:24,372 --> 01:06:26,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What would someone like her be doing here?</font>

1185
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:30,612
<font color=#FFFF00>This is just crazy.</font>

1186
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:32,012
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

1187
01:06:35,812 --> 01:06:36,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go and watch.</font>

1188
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:38,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung.</font>

1189
01:06:44,112 --> 01:06:46,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here, Ms Lee?</font>

1190
01:06:46,272 --> 01:06:49,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I finally got permission to marry.</font>

1191
01:06:50,872 --> 01:06:52,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Permission to marry?</font>

1192
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you getting married?</font>

1193
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:55,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it unbelievable?</font>

1194
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum and Dad finally gave in.</font>

1195
01:06:57,442 --> 01:07:00,542
<font color=#FFFF00>They want to see you tomorrow for an official meeting.</font>

1196
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:03,242
<font color=#FFFF00>What is she talking about?</font>

1197
01:07:03,272 --> 01:07:05,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, the thing is...</font>

1198
01:07:05,512 --> 01:07:08,312
<font color=#FFFF00>What the CEO is saying is...</font>

1199
01:07:08,312 --> 01:07:11,472
<font color=#FFFF00>you're going to marry Tae Pyung?</font>

1200
01:07:11,472 --> 01:07:12,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that it?</font>

1201
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:16,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Tae Pyung promised to marry each other 15 years ago.</font>

1202
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:19,912
<font color=#FFFF00>I was immature and I left him then,</font>

1203
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:23,142
<font color=#FFFF00>but fate brought us together again, so this time I'm marrying him.</font>

1204
01:07:24,842 --> 01:07:25,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

1205
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:28,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not waste time. Let's get married next week.</font>

1206
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:30,712
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

1207
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:34,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is marrying whom? Tae Pyung is my husband.</font>

1208
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:37,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What do you mean? You said you're cousins.</font>

1209
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:39,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Hee, let me explain.</font>

1210
01:07:39,672 --> 01:07:41,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care if you aren't cousins.</font>

1211
01:07:41,942 --> 01:07:43,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to marry you.</font>

1212
01:07:43,812 --> 01:07:45,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You are mine, Jun.</font>

1213
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:47,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- This can't be happening. - Let go.</font>

1214
01:07:48,212 --> 01:07:49,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - Isn't this pretty?</font>

1215
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:50,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

1216
01:07:52,712 --> 01:07:54,012
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey! - Let go!</font>

1217
01:08:16,512 --> 01:08:19,212
<font color=#FFFF00>(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

1218
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do all the women here start by grabbing someone's hair?</font>

1219
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:24,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you venting at us?</font>

1220
01:08:24,312 --> 01:08:26,312
<font color=#FFFF00>It's her fault for hitting on a married man.</font>

1221
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:27,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Fire your manager...</font>

1222
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,072
<font color=#FFFF00>or cancel your contract with us. It's one or the other.</font>

1223
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you look down on us now that we're poor?</font>

1224
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:36,012
<font color=#FFFF00>You're using the apartment you got as leverage on Hyo Won.</font>

1225
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations.</font>

1226
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I feel so little?</font>

1227
01:08:38,742 --> 01:08:40,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you did something wrong.</font>

1228
01:08:40,972 --> 01:08:43,412
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's this? - Sorry for making you wait.</font>

1229
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:44,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you marry me?</font>
