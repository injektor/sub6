Anna! Wake up!

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,399
Anna! Anna!

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,064

What? 911?

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,500
Are you crazy?
You can't call 911!

12
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:58,500
But sir, the JSS ambulance
will take far too long!

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
We have no time!

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,299
You can't! I'll cancel the call to 911
and send over one of our ambulances.

15
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,099
Sir! Sir!

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,200
Damn it!

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,799
Chief! The situation is
looking quite bad!

18
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,799
Wait for me!

- Floor it.
- Yes, sir?

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,099
- I said floor it, bastard!
- Yes, sir.

22
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,699
Are you coming to, Anna?
Huh? Anna!

23
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:34,800
Anna!

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,099
Hey, what are you doing?
Why isn't the ambulance coming?

25
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,000
Damn it, this is
driving me crazy!

26
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:51,599
Get her in!
Quickly!

27
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,039
Hurry!

28
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,500
Move.

29
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:03,199
Move.
Move, punk!

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,800
This is K2.
Heading toward the nearest hospital.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
You can't go to a hospital.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,500
- Head to the JSS Headquarters.
- What?

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,199
We're not in a situation
where we can afford to--

34
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,000
Just step on it already!

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,199
If we go to the hospital,
we're all dead!

36
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,800
Ugh, damn it!

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
- Move.
- Out of the way!

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,699
Excuse us!

39
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,899
Move, move!

40
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,399
Huh? Why are they all
in such a hurry?

41
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:03,100
Look at you, acting all pretty!
It's all Photoshop, isn't it?

42
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,199
- No, I didn't!
- Oh, whatever!

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,500
She's so pretty.
Where have I seen her before?

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,300
What do you mean?
She's sitting right in front of you.

45
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,800
No, not you.
The woman sitting behind you.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,500
I definitely feel like
I've seen this face a lot.

47
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:23,699
Isn't it that woman?

48
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,699
You know, that "angel"!

49
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,399
The "angel" that
Jean-Paul Lafelt is looking for!

50
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,699
- Well?
- No way. I don't think so.

51
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,199
Why would she be in Korea?

52
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,699
Isn't she in Spain?

53
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,300
I don't think so.
This looks just like her.

54
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,899
Oh, I know.
Let's put this photo on social media.

55
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:41,899
Okay?

58
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,800
What?
Oh. Okay.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,199
Leave! You'll only be a hindrance
if you stay here like this!

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
I understand.

63

64

<i>Did Dad really tell you
to give this to me?</i>

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,500
<i>Of course.</i>

68

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,899
<i>No.</i>

70
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,899
Mom?

71

<i>No!</i>

72
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,000
M...mom?

73
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,600
Are you all right?

74
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,199
Miss, are you all right?

75
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,899
Please calm down.

76
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,699
Are you experiencing
any pain anywhere?

77
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,500
Where is this place?

78
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,200
This is the medical room
at JSS Headquarters.

79
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,399
Mr. Je Ha brought you
here from the park.

80
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,299
It would've been terrible if he'd been
even a little bit later than he was.

81
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,778
Hey! How did things
go in there?

82
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,299
I've managed to calm down
the allergic reaction quite a bit.

83
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,200
Um, shouldn't we move her
to a hospital now?

84
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,799
I'm a doctor too, you know.

85
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,700
And we're better equipped
here than most ERs.

86
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:08,799
Her body will be fine with some medicine,
but the issue is her mental state.

87
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,700
I don't know what she'll do again
in her current mental state.

88
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,100
She'll need to see a
psychologist eventually.

89
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,799
You'll have to keep
an especially close watch on her.

90
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,299
But, um... did she say anything about me?
Like, that I harassed her or something?

91
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,299
What kind of nonsense is that?

92
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,799
You think she's in a mental state
to be saying such things?

93
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,000
- Geez!
- Geez.

94
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:44,200
Why did you send back the ambulance?

95
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,100
Chief!

96
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:55,200
Geez. I was planning to get some sleep
because I have to work later!

97
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,500
Such is Anna's plight.

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,799
It's better to leave her to die than to
expose her existence to the world.

99
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,700
Do you get it now?

100
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,200
And what better opportunity
would we have had than today

101
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,399
when you gave her strawberries and she
willingly ate them, knowing she'd die?

102
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,200
Even Assemblyman Jang couldn't
say anything about this.

103
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Who's the person who
sent back the ambulance?

104
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,000
What are you going to do about it
regardless of who it may have been?

105
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
No matter what you do,
Anna's circumstances won't change.

106
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,399
The only thing you can do is
to protect her at all costs!

107
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,899
If you'd taken Anna
to a hospital before

108
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,049
we all would've been done for.

109
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:48,000
Mi Ran, the housekeeper,
and the doctors at the ER too!

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
In other words,
everyone who knows about Anna.

111
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,200
Well, you would've been an exception
since you're a member of Cloud Nine.

112
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,077
Did you already forget why the old
people at the orchard almost died?

113
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:07,200
Acting this way
is quite unlike you.

114
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,299
If they know you're acting this way,
it'll be harder for you to protect Anna!

115
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,100
If you really want to protect her,
act as you always do.

116
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,799
Go on now.

117
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,899
Damn it.

118
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:37,100
Make sure you watch over
that poor child well, all right?

119
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
Do you know Anna?

120
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,299
Not well, no.

121
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:48,799
I only know that she's been forced
to go abroad due to having bad parents.

122
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,500
Yes, you could say that again.
She has terrible parents.

123
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,100
Damn it. And her dad is the
presidential candidate, of all things.

124
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,299
Damn it.

125
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,500
Who's her father?

126
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,299
That girl's last name is Go.
Her name is Go Anna.

127
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,600
She's not legally
Jang Se Joon's daughter.

128
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,500
Her last name is "Go"?

129
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,700
You didn't know?
Her last name definitely is "Go."

130
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,799
There was a referee by the name
of Go Am Wook. An American.

131
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,100
Her mother, Um Hye Rin,
got married to that guy!

132
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,700
Wait. Then Jang Se Joon
seduced a married woman and--

133
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,000
No, that's not it!

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Well, it's complicated.

135
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,299
That's... wow, I've lived
quite long, haven't I?

136
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,799
So what happened is

137
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,700
she did get married to the American,
but she was already pregnant by then!

138
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,299
With Jang Se Joon's child!

139
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,799
You get what I'm saying now?

140
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,399
I didn't know that she was
pregnant back then either!

141
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,600
But I don't know what happened.
Maybe she was abused by her husband.

142
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,500
But Um Hye Rin, who'd gone to America,
appeared with Anna in her arms

143
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:09,299
in front of Jang Se Joon, who was
happily married to Choi Yoo Jin!

144
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,000
You understand what
I'm saying, right?

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,200
He acted like a family with them
behind Choi Yoo Jin's back.

146
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,899
But that young girl had
such a terrible fate.

147
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,299
Her mother ended
having a violent death!

148
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,799
And she was dragged abroad
shortly after that.

149
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,500
That's why I'm saying that
she's a pitiful child.

150
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,700
A violent... death?

151
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Oh, you mean Um Hye Rin?

152
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,500
Well, yeah.
Suicides are gruesome things, after all.

153
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
Isn't that right?

154
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,399
Oh yeah. I don't know if Choi Yoo
Jin will continue to let her live

155
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,700
if she keeps acting up like this.

156
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,100
So, did you give
it some thought?

157
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,200
Why are you in such a rush?

158
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000

The acorn jelly here
is quite good.

160

I'm sure that you don't have much time.

161
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,299
Since it's been a while
since "that" has started.

162
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:25,000
It seems that the president still can't
forgive you and Assemblyman Jang.

163
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,500
He doesn't want you two
to betray him, the former president

two into the Blue House--

the Foundation and JB Group.

172
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,600
All in.

173
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,799
You could squash me so easily
with the information in there.

174
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,799
So you're proposing that
we share our weaknesses?

175
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,701
Yes.

176
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,700
Is that enough for you
to make a deal with me?

177
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,799
As to be expected of you.

178
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
I'm sorry.
We're closed for the day.

179
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,500
Hey, come on.
There are still people in there!

180
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
The lights are on too!

181
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,799
They're our last
customers of the day.

182
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,500
Come on. Let me just get
a sip of makgeoli and go.

183
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,600
Must you force yourself in?

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,700
Looks like this place
does some great business.

185
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,299
They even pick and choose
their customers too.

186
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,399
Let's go.

187
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,799
Yes, it's me.

188
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,500
I understand why Chairman Choi,
your younger brother, fears you now.

189
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
That's a compliment, right?

190
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,099
Oh, of course!

191
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:35,500
How could I dare insult the one who will
be the First-in-Command in this country?

192
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,799
It's a compliment.

193
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,000
That's not quite right.

194
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,299
My husband will be the one
who'll be First-in-Command.

195
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Excuse me?

196
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,900
Oh, is that right?

197
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,099
What?

198
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:57,900
All right, then. When would
you like to join our party?

199
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,299
We can't just quietly slink in, right?

200
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm preparing a nice show, but I'd like
for you to clear the way for us first.

201
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Really? All right.

202
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,607
Did the meeting go...

203
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,900
It went well, didn't it?

204
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,200
Does it seem that way?

205
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,299
Congratulations, Madam.

206
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,700
Thank you.

207
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,799
What a beautiful night!

208
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,500
You don't believe me?

209
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
What?

210
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,500
Will they be able
to enter the party then?

211
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,599
Probably.

212
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,099
Because every country has
corrupt people behind the scenes

213
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:47,799
and dirty businesspeople
within their government.

214
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,900
I never would've guessed.

215
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,299
So he ended up collaborating with
Choi Yoo Jin in the end, after all.

216
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:01,599
Then take care of our
internal organization

217
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,900
and prepare a vote
within our party.

218
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Will you be able to do that?

219
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Sir?

220
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,500
The one who exposes and banishes what
is dirty and rotten will become the hero.

221
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,799
Where did you say
Jang Se Joon is now, again?

222
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,700
Assemblyman.
Madam's meeting has just ended.

223
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,799
Oh. And judging from your expression,
I assume that it went well?

224
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,700
Yes, sir.

225
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,000
Really?

226
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,299
Then we'll have to change some of
the content for today too, won't we?

227
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:51,200
We can't cross the people
at the Blue House.

228
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,500
That's right. You'll have to
come on a bit softer today.

229
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,099
I'll get the questions changed too.

230
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,299
All right.
Go on, now.

231
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,299
Yes, sir.

232
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,799
Congratulations, Madam.

233
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,099
No need for that.

234
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,200
How's that child doing?

235
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,799
She's in the infirmary, Madam.

236
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
Really? So she survived the trip here.

237
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
I apologize.

238
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Why are you sorry?
That's just her fate.

239
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,500
Where's the infirmary?

240
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
What? You want to see her, ma'am?

241
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,200
Yeah. You go on ahead
to Cloud Nine, Chief Kim.

242
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,299
- Where is it?
- Oh, I'll guide you there.

243
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
How's her condition?
Can she manage a conversation?

244
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Yes. Her body is
a lot better now

245
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,799
but we'll have to get her psychological
help due to her suicide attempt--

246
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,799
A hospital?

247
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,599
No need.

248
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,000
Just do a better job watching over her
so that she doesn't do anything stupid.

249
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,200
Leave for a bit.
All of you.

250
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Oh, yes, Madam.

251
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,200
Hey! Follow me!

252
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,299
A hospital? Seriously?

253
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
What?

254
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,099
That nun outfit looked
quite good on you.

255
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,000
And your singing voice
was quite touching too.

256
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Did you learn that at the nunnery?

257
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,799
But, you know...

258
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:40,700
just what were you expecting
when you showed up there?

259
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,400
Did you think that I was interfering
so that your father couldn't see you?

260
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,799
You saw him at the church
today too, right?

261
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>Dad.</i>

262
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,809
Why... is Anna...

263
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,799
Your dad doesn't want
to meet with you.

264
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,400
Your dad won't show up here.

265
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,700
Just like how he didn't show up
when your mom Um Hye Rin died

266
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,200
or when you left for Spain.

267
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm sure it hurts.
Yeah.

268
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,500
And I'm sure you want to
deny this because of that.

269
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,400
But this is reality.

270
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:49,099
Dads are all like that.

271
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:53,700
I know this
since I'm someone's daughter too

272
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,299
but daughters all have special
feelings toward their dads.

273
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,900
But... dads are all kind of like that.

274
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,700
They don't know how we feel.

275
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,900
<i>I'm sure you thought that
you were all your dad had left</i>

276
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,299
but you don't mean
that much to him.

277
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:26,000
You're a small, burdensome
fragment from his past.

278
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,900
Then let me meet Dad.

279
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,200
- I'll ask him myself--
- How?

280
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,299
You want me to drag him here
against his will?

281
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,500
Even a couple in love needs to mind their
manners toward each other, you know.

282
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,400
You dad doesn't want to see you,
so what do you want me to do?

283
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,799
Dad... doesn't love you.

284
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,299
Is that what your mother told you?

285
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,000
Sure. I understand how
she must have felt.

286
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,099
She must've hated me
quite a bit.

287
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,700
But, Anna.

288
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,299
There's something you didn't know about
your mom, since you were too young.

289
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,200
<i>It's hard for people like us
to understand.</i>

290
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:38,799
<i>But do you know what the life goal
for all assemblymen is?</i>

291
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,099
It's to be re-elected
during the next election cycle.

292
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,799
Your dad's no exception.

293
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,299
However, do you know
what your mom said to him then?

294
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,299
Your mom was using you
to blackmail your dad.

295
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,400
With the election coming up, too.

296
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,500
She may have been
a good mother to you, but...

297
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,000
well, figures.

298
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,599
I'm sure it was hard for you as well,
since your mother was an alcoholic.

299
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:13,299
How else could you have given her
those pills with your own hands?

300
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,857
That's not true.

301
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:18,799
My mom didn't die because
of the sleeping pills I brought her.

302
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,021
There was someone at my house then.

303
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,900
And they tried to kill me too.

304
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,700
So?

305
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,900
Was that me?

306
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:37,700
Anna. Your memories
are lying to you.

307
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,900
Sometimes, the truth is
just too unbelievable.

308
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,000
But... this is the truth.

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,500
Your mom died because
of the pills you gave her.

310
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,434
Lies. I heard everything
from our old housekeeper.

311
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,799
Your old housekeeper?

312
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:01,299
<i>Oh, the lady who you went to see
before at the assisted living facility?</i>

313
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,200
Anna.

314
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,799
If I did kill your mother and that
woman had known about that...

315
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:13,299
do you really think that
I would've let that woman live?

316
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,900
Please, stop it already.

317
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,400
Anna is quite ill.

318
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,700
Figures.

319
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Looks like I've said way too many
unnecessary things today.

320
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
And to an ill person too.

321
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,799
All right, Anna.

322
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,900
You must be tired too, since you've been
on the run since early this morning.

323
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Get some rest.

324
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,299
And take good care of yourself.

325
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,900
Come to Cloud Nine.

326
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:35,590
Don't cry.

327
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,099
And wait.

328
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,599
I'll bring your dad to you.

329
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
What brings you here?

330
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
I wanted to see
Assemblyman Jang's appearance.

331
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,099
What?
See his appearance?

332
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:51,599
What the hell are you planning now?

333
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,500
Nothing!

334
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,900
But that person--

335
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:57,599
Who?

336
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,000
It's nothing.

337
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hey!

338
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:05,200
What a rude punk.

339
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:11,200
All right, everyone.
It's been tough lately, hasn't it?

340
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,799
- Yes!
- Yes!

341
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,799
Yes, that's right. We're standing
at a crossroads right now.

342
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,000
The poor are getting poorer
while the rich are getting richer.

343
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The number of elderly people
we have is increasing

344
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,500
but the number of young people paying
into pension funds is decreasing.

345
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:35,200
However, the younger generation is
crying out, saying there are no jobs.

346
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
The rich and poor
are at odds with one another

347
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,700
and the old and the young harbor
hostility toward one another.

348
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,700
What's worse, those who love
each other and want to marry...

349
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,000
This is K2.

350
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,599
There's a suspicious character near
the front of the stage, at the middle.

351
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,500
Our population is aging fast, but the
marriage and birth rates are quite low!

352
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,799
This is Team Leader Seo.
What do you mean by that?

353
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,099
Why is that?

354
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:59,500
"It's the economy, stupid!"

355
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,799
It's the economy, stupid!

356
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:09,000
Well, of course, I'm not
calling you all idiots.

357
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,400
10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,
and 2 o'clock from the upstage center.

358
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
<i>They have something
suspicious on them.</i>

359
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,400
The guys sitting at B12 and C16
are hiding something.

360
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,500
The issue still remains
with the economy.

361
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Team Leader here. Those people
passed the security check before.

362
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,099
They're fine.

363
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Oh, but someone told me that if
I feel pain, I should go to the hospital.

364
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,900
That's right!

365
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,000
Looks like there's another
person in pain right there.

366
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:47,700
Yes, that's right.

367
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,900
We're all in pain right now.

368
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,799
I'm sorry to ask this of your generation
when you're busy looking for jobs

369
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:23,000
but to be honest, my generation
didn't study too hard.

370
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,900
We were busy with dates, firstly.

371
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,099
But a guy like me, who's ugly,
didn't get asked out a lot.

372
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,200
I was able to pass the bar exam in
my junior year. And with top scores.

373
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:43,099
Yes, I am bragging.

374
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm sorry.

375
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:54,299
Secondly, we didn't have to study if
we were involved in political protests.

376
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,900
Who'd care about grades, after all,
when the country is in turmoil?

377
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,700
So we didn't worry about getting
married or getting a job.

378
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,400
Why? Because the country
was in turmoil!

379
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,298
To be honest, it was because our
standard of living was getting better.

380
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:15,700
There were tons of jobs to be had!

381
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,900
And we didn't worry
even if prices of things were rising!

382
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
K2 here.

383
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,900
Stop the show.
The VIP is in danger.

384
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Now.

385
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,489
Are you crazy?
K2. Where are you?

386
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:30,199
Backstage.

387
00:33:30,998 --> 00:33:40,199
This is why the elderly say now that
things were much better back in the day.

388
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:43,400
However, how are things now?

389
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:48,255
"It's the economy, stupid!"

390
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:51,400
It's the economy, stupid!

391
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,199
Stop doing useless things
and just sit still.

392
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,998
I went on a date
with my wife.

393
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:14,000
I was a poor guy without
a single cent in my pocket...

394
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:25,295
Hey, K1!
What are you doing here?

395
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,500
Move before you damage
the goods, got it?

396
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,699
You must be destroyed!

397
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,599
Jang Se Joon, who hates international
finance! Wake up from your delusions!

398
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,099
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Wake up! Wake up!

399
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:54,400
Wait!

400
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,358
Let go of those people.

401
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,300
Do not cover those people's mouths!

402
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,699
These people don't deserve
to be treated this way.

403
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:13,900
These people have the right to throw eggs
at me and the other Korean politicians!

404
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,699
And that's because these people have been
let down by so many politicians thus far.

405
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,900
And I'm not going to die just because
I'm pelted by a couple of eggs.

406
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,570
And if these people really
wanted to hurt me

407
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,900
they would've thrown stones, not eggs.

408
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,699
Isn't that right?

409
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:46,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

410
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,400
It's because these people
have affection toward me

411
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,400
that they threw eggs at me.
That's what I believe.

412
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,900
And the thing they chanted.
"Wake up." Isn't that right?

413
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,699
If I am a politician,
I do need to wake up.

414
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:06,699
I understand.
I'll do that.

415
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,900
I will wake up.

416
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,400
I demand the prosecution
start a strict investigation right away

417
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,998
on the International Finance Group,
who these people believe that I hate

418
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:48,099
which has been far too
suspicious as of late.

419
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:53,699
Furthermore, as of now

420
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:59,498
I will not exercise the immunity
given to me as an assemblyman

421
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:06,199
and will head to the prosecutor's office
tomorrow morning to be investigated.

422
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,998
Furthermore, I will submit to
a search and seizure

423
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:19,400
at all locations related to me, including
my home, office, and election office

424
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:27,300
and ask that they will find and expose
any hint of corruption, if there is any.

425
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:35,400
And if the search yields anything that
sparks the slightest hint of suspicion

426
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,300
I will pull out of the presidential
race as your candidate.

427
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:56,998
To those of you who
threw eggs at me today.

428
00:37:56,998 --> 00:38:05,900
If you're satisfied with the results
that this investigation yields

429
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:14,199
please don't waste eggs by throwing them
and just give them to me instead.

430
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:18,099
It's fine to attack me with
eggs and all that

431
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,400
but I'd rather bring them to
my wife, who loves to cook, and...

432
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,099
be loved by her even more.

433
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:58,099
- Jang Se Hoon!
- Jang Se Hoon!

434
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:02,998
Man, this reeks.

435
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:05,800
I reek, don't I?

436
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
It's all right.

437
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,599
Those punks.
I told them to only throw two or so.

438
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,400
Why'd they throw so many?

439
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:13,699
Is there some pent-up frustration
toward me or something?

440
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:16,400
But still, this stunt had
a great effect.

441
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,699
You have some pent-up
frustration toward me too, don't you?

442
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,199
What? Of course not.
Maybe love, but not frustration.

443
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:29,699
I need to shower, so that's
going to take a bit of time.

444
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
I'll call you when I'm done.

445
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,599
Yes, sir.

446
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:37,699
Oh geez.

447
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,599
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

448
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,400
Geez.

449
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,099
Have you eaten?

450
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,699
- Yes.
- Oh.

451
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm going to head in first,
so come in quickly. Okay?

452
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,400
Yes, sir.

453
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,199
Oh, what a cutie.

454
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,699
Why don't we get some coffee?

455
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,800
Who knows how long this
will take, after all?

456
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,699
You stand by here, okay?

457
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:22,998
Yes, sir.

458
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,398
What are you doing?
Come in!

459
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:33,300
Yes, I'm coming.

460
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:28,599
Here you are.

461
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:32,199
Get your clothes on.
You need to get out of here.

462
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,699
- Who are you?
- Police! Move!

463
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:51,300
- Stop right there!
- Stop!

464
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,500
- Who's this?
- He's on the same side as that woman.

465
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,599
What?

466
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,498
And the cops will be forcing
their way in here any minute now.

467
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,099
Since the cops are on their side too.

468
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,099
Do you want to be arrested, damn it?

469
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:18,400
Don't look at them.

470
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
There he is!
Get him!

471
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Run!

472
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,800
Stop!

473
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,400
Stop right there!

474
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,498
Move!

475
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,900
What's going on?

476
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,099
The cops set a trap.
I'll leave it to you. Thanks!

477
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,599
- What's with those guys?
- They're Park Kwan Soo's cronies.

478
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,099
A trap?

479
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,199
Geez, you bastards.

480
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,400
You do know that this is
an obstruction of justice, right?

481
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,300
Go ahead and arrest me, then.

482
00:42:54,246 --> 00:42:56,099
The suspect has fled the scene.
Block the entrance.

483
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,099
Hey, secure the CCTV footage.

484
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,400
And show me your arrest warrant.

485
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Though you probably don't have one since
you planned this and waited outside.

486
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,998
A warrant?
I don't need that.

487
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:09,300
The victim called us
and reported him for sexual assault.

488
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,199
Chief Joo! Look.

489
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:13,998
These two were on the same side.

490
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:21,099
Call the Central Office and report that
the cops conspired to kill a politician.

491
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,400
And send out the photo evidence too!

492
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,599
Yes, sir.

493
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,400
<i>We lost them!</i>

494
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:41,400
All right. I think the show is over now.

495
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:50,199
Yeah.
See you next time, then.

496
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,099
Oh man, that was a close one!

497
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,199
Wow, thanks.

498
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,199
No problem, sir.

499
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:14,599
No, really. If it hadn't been for you,
I would've been in big trouble.

500
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,400
Yes, I'm sure.

501
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:21,699
But, um, where are we headed?

502
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,599
To meet with your daughter.

503
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,599
What?

504
00:44:26,885 --> 00:44:28,300
Stop the car.

505
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:34,900
Stop the car, damn it!

506
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,500
If you don't want to
freaking see her...

507
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,300
If you don't want to see her,
go and tell her that to her face.

508
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,199
Instead of giving
a young woman false hopes.

509
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,099
Who ordered you
to do something like this?

510
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:50,998
I'm not the type to do something
like this because I'm told to.

511
00:44:50,998 --> 00:44:53,099
This bastard!

512
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:58,699
Do you think you'll be okay
after doing something like this?

513
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,900
You know, dogs...

514
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:05,400
even have a sense of duty to protect
puppies that they've taken in.

515
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,498
And here, you have a child.

516
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:08,710
Shouldn't you supervise her, at the very
least, if she's such an inconvenience?

517
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,601
You impudent little punk!
How dare you--

518
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:12,827
Do you...

519
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:14,998
know where I found
Anna today?

520
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:18,699
Dream Land.

521
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:25,099
Do you remember now?

522
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:31,699
Do you know
what she said when I found her?

523
00:45:32,802 --> 00:45:37,114
He's not mad that I suddenly
appeared out of nowhere?

524
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:38,800
She was worrying about you.

525
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:43,800
But now I know the truth.

526
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,199
That the bad person who'd been
bothering my dad so much

527
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,199
was me all along.

528
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,199
What?
She ate strawberries?

529
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:04,317
She has a severe allergy,
so if she eats them--

530
00:46:04,317 --> 00:46:05,706
Yes, that's right!

531
00:46:05,706 --> 00:46:07,117
That's right.

532
00:46:07,117 --> 00:46:09,699
She... she could die.

533
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:13,626
Anna...

534
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:18,300
didn't try to commit suicide
because she hates you, I think.

535
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:22,900
It's because she realized that she's
a burdensome existence in your life...

536
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,599
and tried to disappear quietly.
That's probably why she ate it.

537
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:04,380
If you really did all this
just for Anna's sake

538
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,599
promise me this.

539
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,699
That you'll protect her
until the very end.

540
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,900
If you do,
I'll meet with her.

541
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,800
Sure.

542
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:21,400
I promise.

543
00:47:29,476 --> 00:47:30,541
Yes, Chief?

544
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:32,199
<i>Hey! Why haven't you
been picking up?</i>

545
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,298
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

546
00:47:36,798 --> 00:47:38,500
<i>I asked you where you are, punk!</i>

547
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,405
It's me, Chief Joo.

548
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:43,298
Geez. You're going to blow out
my eardrums at this rate.

549
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:45,534
I apologize, Assemblyman.

550
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:48,398
I'm at JSS Headquarters right now.

551
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,699
<i>Come here to pick me up.</i>

552
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:51,298
Yes, sir.

553
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:00,500
The reason why I didn't meet
Anna for all this time

554
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,298
is because me seeing her
puts her in danger.

555
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:09,398
I've sold my soul to the devil
for the sake of my own greed.

556
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:14,798
And due to that, I've lost
my morals and the people I love.

557
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:22,398
But this thing called greed
doesn't come with brakes.

558
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:28,699
I need to speed up even more in order
to escape Choi Yoo Jin's clutches.

559
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:34,199
Anna is a hostage.

560
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:39,500
I can only save her if I gain
the ultimate amount of power.

561
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,898
If I turn back now, Choi Yoo Jin will
deem Anna useless as a hostage.

562
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:50,699
And if that happens,
Anna will be in danger.

563
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,480
If I meet with Anna
and say even one wrong thing

564
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,766
Choi Yoo Jin will realize
what I'm trying to do

565
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:04,500
and hide Anna where
I can never find her.

566
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:15,199
That's why the fact that Anna is in Korea
now feels like a death sentence to me.

567
00:49:18,528 --> 00:49:23,298
And that's why you shouldn't
have brought me here.

568
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:32,398
But there's no use in
crying over spilled milk.

569
00:49:34,443 --> 00:49:36,298
You better keep your promise.

570
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,699
I'm begging you.

571
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:49,342
All right. Let's go.

572
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:57,699
To make my poor daughter even sadder.

573
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:09,900
What's going on, Assemblyman?

574
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,199
I heard that Anna is here right now.

575
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,199
What?

576
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,298
Oh, yes.

577
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:26,199
Assemblyman Jang is going
to the infirmary?

578
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:28,400
All right.

579
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:32,400
Mirror.

580
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,099
Show me the CCTV feed from
the room that Anna is in.

581
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,500
Anna. Your dad is here.

582
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,199
Is she asleep?

583
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,298
Um, no. Not yet.

584
00:50:59,298 --> 00:51:01,699
Oh no.

585
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:05,500
I guess Anna is mad at me, then.

586
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,400
Geez. I'm sorry, Anna.

587
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,798
I was so busy up until now.

588
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,599
What kind of illness does she have,
though? Why is she still here?

589
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,798
Well, she ate strawberry
ice cream, and--

590
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:25,952
Strawberry ice cream?
Well, so what?

591
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:26,952
What?

592
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:31,099
Well, um, Young Miss
has a strawberry allergy, so...

593
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:35,699
What? She's allergic to strawberries?

594
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:41,298
Oh no.

595
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:46,400
You should've been careful!
Why did you feed her such a thing?

596
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:56,900
Anna... did it hurt a lot, honey?

597
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:10,400
He's her dad, and yet he didn't
even know about her allergy?

598
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:17,099
Can all of you leave?
I want to talk to her alone.

599
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,298
Yes, sir.

600
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,599
Anna.

601
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Nobody is here now.

602
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,298
So let's talk a bit with Daddy, okay?

603
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,298
Dad!

604
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,043
Dad!

605
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:29,298
That's right.
Yes, Anna.

606
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,099
Oh, my daughter.

607
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:43,798
<i>I'm sorry, Anna.</i>

608
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:48,099
I missed you so much, Dad!

609
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,400
Oh, yes.

610
00:53:54,099 --> 00:54:01,000
Yes, I missed you too, Anna.

611
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,900
All right, let's look here.

612
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,699
Oh my.

613
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:20,900
Looks my daughter is
all grown up now.

614
00:54:22,298 --> 00:54:24,400
You could probably even
get married now.

615
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,067
Yes, Anna.

616
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:33,199
Wait just a bit longer.

617
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,400
When I become president,
I'll choose a fine guy for you.

618
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,099
You'll be able to go on dates
and meet up with friends.

619
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,500
You'll have a fun life.

620
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,798
And when the time comes,
I'll let you get married.

621
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:52,000
So you don't need to
worry about anything anymore.

622
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Okay?

623
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,298
Dad, please listen to me.

624
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:58,798
Mom didn't commit suicide.

625
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,400
I remembered everything that
happened that night.

626
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,599
<i>When I'd gone into Mom's room,
she was already passed out.</i>

627
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:10,400
<i>And someone covered my eyes
so that I couldn't see who they were</i>

628
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,099
and my mouth too.

629
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:15,298
Anna.

630
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:18,599
All of that is in the past now.

631
00:55:19,298 --> 00:55:21,099
You must forget about it now.

632
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:23,298
It's true, Dad!

633
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:26,298
And that woman came in.

634
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:30,099
Choi Yoo Jin definitely killed Mom.

635
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,400
Anna!

636
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,699
You shouldn't just
say things like that.

637
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:34,699
Dad.

638
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:36,298
Don't ever say anything
like that ever again.

639
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:41,400
If anyone hears you say that,
it'll just get in my way

640
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,400
and it'll be bad for you too.

641
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:46,798
Anna.

642
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:48,400
You're just imagining all that

643
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,298
because you experienced something
traumatizing at a young age.

644
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:55,099
No, Dad.

645
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:58,699
Mom cried a lot that day, so
I did give her that medicine, but--

646
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:00,099
Anna!

647
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,599
Are you really going
to be like this?

648
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,400
Are you doing this because you
want to see your dad fail?

649
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
Dad.

650
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,599
If you say anything like that again,
I'll never see you again.

651
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,699
Are you okay with that?

652
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:17,699
Dad.

653
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:25,298
Yes. You're a good girl.

654
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,099
Yes. That's how you should be.

655
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:38,000
<i>I'm sorry, Anna.</i>

656
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,199
<i>Wait just a bit longer, please.</i>

657
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:01,900
There's something that
I want to ask you, Dad.

658
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,400
Yes? What is it?

659
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:08,199
Did you love Mom?

660
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:10,000
What?

661
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,099
Of course I did.

662
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,400
That's why you were born.

663
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,900
And did Mom really use
me to blackmail you?

664
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,599
What?

665
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:37,400
<i>Choi Yoo Jin.
You devil.</i>

666
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:41,900
Is that why you threw
me and Mom away?

667
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,900
Anna.

668
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,798
Those are adult matters.

669
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:06,500
I'm an adult now too.
And I want to know.

670
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,699
Anna.

671
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:11,500
None of that matters anymore.

672
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,400
Why?

673
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,400
You said you loved Mom, though.

674
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,599
But Mom died!

675
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:25,500
And I was forced to go abroad, but
you didn't even come to look for me!

676
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,400
So why is that meaningless?

677
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,199
Anna.

678
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:44,099
Your dad is someone who's doing
important things for this country.

679
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:46,400
And when you do
important things like I do...

680
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:50,500
matters that are less significant
fall to the wayside.

681
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,099
So it was true.

682
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,699
What do you mean?

683
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:09,000
<i>I'm sure you thought that
you were all your dad had left</i>

684
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,329
but you don't mean that much to him.

685
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:17,699
You're just a small, burdensome
fragment of his past.

686
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:20,599
What Choi Yoo Jin
told me was true.

687
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,298
It's a vana ilusión
(futile dream).

688
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,298
Anna.

689
