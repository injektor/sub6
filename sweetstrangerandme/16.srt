00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,660
<font color="yellow">She does have a positive drive.</font>

308
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,220
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she pretend to be pretty?</font>

309
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,990
<font color="yellow">It's because she is pretty.</font>

310
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,260
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - Gossiping about you.</font>

311
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,360
<font color="yellow">Bragging about my girlfriend.</font>

312
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,490
<font color="yellow">I have to go now.</font>

313
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,990
<font color="yellow">I'm not happy watching you two together.</font>

314
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,690
<font color="yellow">But then, why don't you two settle your relationship?</font>

315
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,990
<font color="yellow">Are you two going to stay as a father and daughter?</font>

316
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,360
<font color="yellow">Why don't you answer whenever I ask about this?</font>

317
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,990
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

318
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,290
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil.</font>

319
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,660
<font color="yellow">Do you like your relationship as it is?</font>

320
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,890
<font color="yellow">- No. - Of course not.</font>

321
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,320
<font color="yellow">As a friend, I will help settle your relationship.</font>

322
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,220
<font color="yellow">See you at court.</font>

323
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,960
<font color="yellow">He really likes to settle things down.</font>

324
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,520
<font color="yellow">Isn't it true that we have to settle our relationship?</font>

325
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,590
<font color="yellow">That means we have to go through another trial.</font>

326
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,720
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing here?</font>

327
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,760
<font color="yellow">When Duk Shim ran away from home,</font>

328
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,460
<font color="yellow">you came to me for help.</font>

329
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,390
<font color="yellow">Now, Duk Shim asked for help regarding you.</font>

330
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,920
<font color="yellow">Am I a connecting bridge for brother and sister?</font>

331
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
<font color="yellow">How is Mother? Is she all right?</font>

332
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,890
<font color="yellow">She said, "What wrong with your brother's personality?"</font>

333
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,620
<font color="yellow">"My low blood pressure is going up."</font>

334
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,990
<font color="yellow">That's how she's like.</font>

335
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,790
<font color="yellow">I'm off to work now.</font>

336
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,020
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong.</font>

337
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,990
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

338
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,860
<font color="yellow">You don't want me to be like this?</font>

339
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,060
<font color="yellow">I am also irritated by how cool I am.</font>

340
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,760
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

341
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,360
<font color="yellow">Don't ever call me again.</font>

342
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,520
<font color="yellow">Tell Duk Shim not to call me too.</font>

343
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,090
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

344
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,660
<font color="yellow">Na Ri told me to be honest. So I'm saying this.</font>

345
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,320
<font color="yellow">I really like you.</font>

346
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,720
<font color="yellow">You know why I like you because I tell you every time.</font>

347
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,990
<font color="yellow">So don't call me as a friend...</font>

348
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,790
<font color="yellow">or as a connecting bridge to your sister.</font>

349
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,860
<font color="yellow">If you call me again,</font>

350
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,320
<font color="yellow">I will just consider it as dating.</font>

351
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,690
<font color="yellow">You are here.</font>

352
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,520
<font color="yellow">Where is Nan Gil?</font>

353
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,660
<font color="yellow">You told him not to come. That's why I am here alone.</font>

354
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,290
<font color="yellow">Did I?</font>

355
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,820
<font color="yellow">You don't like Nan Gil.</font>

356
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,860
<font color="yellow">Who said I didn't like him?</font>

357
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,160
<font color="yellow">He manages Hong Dumplings so well even without me.</font>

358
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,190
<font color="yellow">He's much better than I thought he'd be.</font>

359
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,990
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

360

361
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
<font color="yellow">- You must've been through a lot. - It's okay.</font>

362
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,590
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil, get me a uniform.</font>

363
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,060
<font color="yellow">I'm the original owner, you see.</font>

364
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,820
<font color="yellow">I want a uniform of my own too.</font>

365
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,720
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

366
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,890
<font color="yellow">Why do you need a uniform?</font>

367
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,620
<font color="yellow">You can't even make dumplings.</font>

368
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,520

460
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,390
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong.</font>

461
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,330
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

462
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,960
<font color="yellow">I met with Suh Young and got on my knees.</font>

463
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,420
<font color="yellow">I fixed your broken engagement.</font>

464
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,560
<font color="yellow">It's not like there's a deep grudge or anything.</font>

465
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,920
<font color="yellow">It looks like she hasn't gotten over you either.</font>

466
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:34,260
<font color="yellow">I told you not to touch my personal life.</font>

467
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,330
<font color="yellow">We're merging with Suh Won Group...</font>

468
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,090
<font color="yellow">with your marriage to Suh Young as the foundation.</font>

469
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,830
<font color="yellow">- Let's set a date. - You'll merge...</font>

470
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,560
<font color="yellow">and fire the employees?</font>

471
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,760
<font color="yellow">We're not a charity!</font>

472
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,090
<font color="yellow">We need to make up the money we lost to the foundation!</font>

473
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,120
<font color="yellow">Mr. Chairman. Did you forget what I have on you?</font>

474
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,890
<font color="yellow">And I'm dating someone!</font>

475
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,560
<font color="yellow">The magic ball?</font>

476
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,590
<font color="yellow">We don't do that anymore.</font>

477
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,560
<font color="yellow">Let's look into your future.</font>

478
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

479
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,620
<font color="yellow">Pick two cards.</font>

480
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,390
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

481
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,020
<font color="yellow">This is almost impossible to see.</font>

482
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,420
<font color="yellow">The completion card.</font>

483
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,060
<font color="yellow">You've accomplished everything.</font>

484
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,520
<font color="yellow">"Legend".</font>

485
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,560
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ko Nan Gil, you are a legend.</font>

486
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,020
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

487
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,720
<font color="yellow">"Expansion". You must be expanding your business.</font>

488
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,560
<font color="yellow">What business are you expanding?</font>

489
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,390
<font color="yellow">- Get up. - Why? I want to try too.</font>

490
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,830
<font color="yellow">- What? - Excuses me.</font>

491
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,260
<font color="yellow">What? She seems to be right.</font>

492
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,520
<font color="yellow">Your girlfriend wants to try it. What is it?</font>

493
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,760
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. Let's go. - What?</font>

494
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,330
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Excuse me.</font>

495
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,490
<font color="yellow">They are each other's destiny.</font>

496
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,060
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous.</font>

497
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,330
<font color="yellow">So jealous.</font>

498
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,020
<font color="yellow">You want to say something, right?</font>

499
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,420
<font color="yellow">Why were you shocked when she mentioned the business?</font>

500
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,960
<font color="yellow">Have some cake first.</font>

501
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,290
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to sugar me up first?</font>

502
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,490
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you...</font>

503
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,220
<font color="yellow">after you get some rest.</font>

504
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,790
<font color="yellow">I'm not moody.</font>

505
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,690
<font color="yellow">I'm not stressed and I don't have insomnia.</font>

506
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,490
<font color="yellow">So I can handle anything. Tell me.</font>

507
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,120
<font color="yellow">- Your father and uncle... - No.</font>

508
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,220
<font color="yellow">No, don't.</font>

509
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,590
<font color="yellow">What did they do this time?</font>

510
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,890
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

511
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,960
<font color="yellow">They signed a contract to franchise out Hong Dumplings.</font>

512
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,830
<font color="yellow">- It's so busy. - Right?</font>

513
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,120
<font color="yellow">- Is there room inside? - Yes. Go on in.</font>

514
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,490
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

515
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,120
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

516
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

517
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,160
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

518
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,790
<font color="yellow">Let's sign.</font>

519
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,790
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

520
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,290
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

521
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,590
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

522
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,490
<font color="yellow">- The dumplings are delicious. - They are?</font>

523
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,830
<font color="yellow">They're the best I've tasted.</font>

524
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,160
<font color="yellow">This is my ID.</font>

525
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,390
<font color="yellow">- It says, "Hong Sung Kyu", right? - I see.</font>

526
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,560
<font color="yellow">Have you seen the TV program?</font>

527
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, we heard it was on TV.</font>

528
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,620
<font color="yellow">Mr. Hong here...</font>

529
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,220
<font color="yellow">was on an expedition to find hidden dumplings masters.</font>

530
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,560
<font color="yellow">But his mentees searched desperately for him on TV,</font>

531
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,390
<font color="yellow">so he put an end to his expedition...</font>

532
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,920
<font color="yellow">and returned to the restaurant.</font>

533
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,360
<font color="yellow">That's right. I wore this outfit...</font>

534
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,460
<font color="yellow">to start a new life.</font>

535
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,420
<font color="yellow">And my son-in-law, Ko Nan Gil,</font>

536
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,460
<font color="yellow">will teach you how to get the flavor.</font>

537
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,890
<font color="yellow">Here we go. Smile.</font>

538
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,620
<font color="yellow">That's what happened.</font>

539
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,090
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

540
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,990
<font color="yellow">How is that great?</font>

541
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,090
<font color="yellow">It's the best thing Father and Uncle did so far.</font>

542
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,760
<font color="yellow">You must be so happy. How did you keep it in?</font>

543
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,390
<font color="yellow">It's only in Seoul now,</font>

544
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,420
<font color="yellow">but imagine Hong Dumplings being across the nation.</font>

545
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,420
<font color="yellow">What about "Flying Couple" as a marketing theme?</font>

546
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,860
<font color="yellow">- What? - Ko Nan Gil and Hong Na Ri's...</font>

547
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,790
<font color="yellow">Flying Couple's Hong Dumplings.</font>

548
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,420
<font color="yellow">"Hong Dumplings. Let's walk on a flowery path."</font>

549
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,830
<font color="yellow">You don't even like dumplings.</font>

550
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,160
<font color="yellow">I love them now.</font>

551
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,390
<font color="yellow">You don't know how to make them.</font>

552
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a quick learner.</font>

553
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,790
<font color="yellow">I'll learn from today on.</font>

554
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,190
<font color="yellow">We're in trouble now.</font>

555
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,220
<font color="yellow">Hong Dumplings. Ko Nan Gil.</font>

556
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,560
<font color="yellow">I met with Suh Young and got on my knees.</font>

557
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,190
<font color="yellow">I fixed your broken engagement.</font>

558
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,720
<font color="yellow">It's not like there's a deep grudge or anything.</font>

559
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,060
<font color="yellow">It looks like she hasn't gotten over you either.</font>

560
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,920
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong. You must've forgotten. I said...</font>

561
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,190
<font color="yellow">if you call me,</font>

562
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,260
<font color="yellow">I'll understand it as we're dating.</font>

563
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,720
<font color="yellow">We can discuss that later.</font>

564
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,790
<font color="yellow">I need you to do one of your skits.</font>

565
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,460
<font color="yellow">A revenge scenario this time.</font>

566
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,860
<font color="yellow">A revenge scenario? For your past love?</font>

567
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,460
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Only losers do that.</font>

568
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,290
<font color="yellow">Whom are you calling me a loser?</font>

569
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,920
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'd do that?</font>

570
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,160
<font color="yellow">Then who is it?</font>

571
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,760
<font color="yellow">- My father. - What?</font>

572
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,390
<font color="yellow">Your... Your father?</font>

573
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,990
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting your father?</font>

574
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

575
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,460
<font color="yellow">Those are the receipts.</font>

576
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,520
<font color="yellow">What's with the prices?</font>

577
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,220
<font color="yellow">A bag and clothes?</font>

578
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,020
<font color="yellow">Do you think I own clothes this conservative?</font>

579
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,420
<font color="yellow">I wrote my account number on the receipt.</font>

580
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,620
<font color="yellow">My credit card is almost maxed out.</font>

581
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,960
<font color="yellow">Please deposit it soon.</font>

582
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

583
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
<font color="yellow">It's been a year.</font>

584
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,120
<font color="yellow">So Duk Bong. What should I do?</font>

585
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,420
<font color="yellow">Duk Shim, come on. Your brother's girlfriend is coming.</font>

586
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,860
<font color="yellow">Greet your father.</font>

587
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,560
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

588
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,590
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

589
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,060
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo, they are my parents.</font>

590
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,590
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Do Yeo Joo.</font>

591
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,760
<font color="yellow">Awesome.</font>

592
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,190
<font color="yellow">Doesn't she look like Suh Young?</font>

593
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,830
<font color="yellow">No. She looks just like her.</font>

594
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,490
<font color="yellow">Mr. Chairman. What do we do about the merger now?</font>

595
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,260
<font color="yellow">Are you really dating?</font>

596
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,260
<font color="yellow">- No. - Yes.</font>

597
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,090
<font color="yellow">Why are your responses different?</font>

598
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,590
<font color="yellow">I don't care. Do as you wish.</font>

599
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,560
<font color="yellow">I said if you call, we're dating, so let's date.</font>

600
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,760
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

601
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,490
<font color="yellow">why don't we become friends and get to know each other?</font>

602
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,060
<font color="yellow">I'll get busy from now on.</font>

603
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,620
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with that.</font>

604
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,690
<font color="yellow">- Even if you don't see me often? - Yes.</font>

605
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,690
<font color="yellow">- Even if I don't call? - Yes.</font>

606
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,090
<font color="yellow">Will you come if I say so?</font>

607
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,960
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Just make money, is that it?</font>

608
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,220
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - May I see other women?</font>

609
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,220
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

610
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,960
<font color="yellow">To a beginner farmer, a year is...</font>

611
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,990
<font color="yellow">a time to learn spring, summer, fall, and winter.</font>

612
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,160
<font color="yellow">That's how our year was.</font>

613
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,390
<font color="yellow">It's a rare day off. Must we clean?</font>

614
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,490
<font color="yellow">Let's throw this out. It just takes up room.</font>

615
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,260
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

616
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,360
<font color="yellow">You can't throw this out.</font>

617
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,860
<font color="yellow">It's a rare day off. Must we clean all day long?</font>

618
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,920
<font color="yellow">You're the one who wanted to clean.</font>

619
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,620
<font color="yellow">You raise your voice at me now.</font>

620
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,160
<font color="yellow">You're mad at me, aren't you?</font>

621
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,260
<font color="yellow">You're annoyed about something else, right?</font>

622
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,620
<font color="yellow">I'm mad about Dad.</font>

623
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking it out on me?</font>

624
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,120
<font color="yellow">Then who else?</font>

625
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,690
<font color="yellow">We argue about little things.</font>

626
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,620
<font color="yellow">We talk about the past.</font>

627
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,120
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking,</font>

628
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,590
<font color="yellow">and the trip to Yeosu...</font>

629
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,520
<font color="yellow">All I remember is your apologizing.</font>

630
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,560
<font color="yellow">We didn't even get to have sashimi on the beach.</font>

631
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,660
<font color="yellow">It's your fault.</font>

632
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,060
<font color="yellow">What? Why are you suddenly bringing that up?</font>

633
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,590
<font color="yellow">I suddenly remembered.</font>

634
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,360
<font color="yellow">But still. It was a really nice day out.</font>

635
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,420
<font color="yellow">The ocean looked pretty too.</font>

636
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,090
<font color="yellow">We talk about the future.</font>

637
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,660
<font color="yellow">If we get married,</font>

638
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,760
<font color="yellow">do you want kids?</font>

639
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,190
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

640
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,090
<font color="yellow">How many?</font>

641
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,860
<font color="yellow">Maybe 2 or 3? What about you?</font>

642
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,290
<font color="yellow">Are we having kids separately?</font>

643
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,960
<font color="yellow">Should we live here forever?</font>

644
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,120
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you want to have kids and live here?</font>

645
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,990
<font color="yellow">It's cold. Let's go.</font>

646
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,420
<font color="yellow">Speed it up already.</font>

647
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,960
<font color="yellow">You're so slow.</font>

648
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,260
<font color="yellow">- Seriously. - Why don't you help us?</font>

649
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,060
<font color="yellow">Hurry it up.</font>

650
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,060
<font color="yellow">It's done. Light it up.</font>

651
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,020
<font color="yellow">There.</font>

652
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
<font color="yellow">- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.</font>

653

654
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,390
<font color="yellow">I'm busy again. I'll come to the terminal.</font>

655
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,390

658
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,620
<font color="yellow">It's hard to see Nan Gil lately.</font>

659
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,860
<font color="yellow">He's been busy.</font>

660
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sure. He has been busy.</font>

661
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,790
<font color="yellow">He's popular with the ladies too.</font>

662
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,520
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

663
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,690
<font color="yellow">Haven't you been on Hong Dumplings' social media page?</font>

664
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

669
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,860

679
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,120
<font color="yellow">But I'm worried.</font>

680
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,990
<font color="yellow">What if he gets so engrossed in his work...</font>

681

<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,</font>

694
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,890
<font color="yellow">I was able to mature, at least just a little bit.</font>

<font color="yellow">The dough is half the flavor of the dumplings,</font>

698
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,790
<font color="yellow">so you need to knead it with heart.</font>

699
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,320
<font color="yellow">Remember how it feels when it's kneaded the best.</font>

700
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,420
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll take over and check your dough.</font>

<font color="yellow">I wanted to pick you up.</font>

711
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,660
<font color="yellow">You should've called at the terminal.</font>

712

00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,820
<font color="yellow">- A lot. - How much, a lot?</font>

<font color="yellow">From the moment I woke up until I fell asleep.</font>

720

<font color="yellow">I think I'll get a place in Seoul.</font>

723
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,720
<font color="yellow">I want my own time.</font>

724
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760

773
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:21,890

774
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,820
<font color="yellow">I thought we could part ways.</font>

775
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,090
<font color="yellow">Now, finally,</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm sure she's fine.</font>

782
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,290

<font color="yellow">Whatever. They were all older women.</font>

786
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,860
<font color="yellow">They were.</font>

787
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,860
<font color="yellow">Do everything yourselves. I'm out.</font>

788
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,120
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. My daughter brought this cake.</font>

790
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,190
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - It's delicious.</font>
