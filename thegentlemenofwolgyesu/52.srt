00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:07,604
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 52)</font>

4
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:09,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Look, strictly speaking,</font>

5
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:11,742
<font color=#FFFF00>that CEO lady is not to blame.</font>

6
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:12,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook insisted...</font>

7
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:15,672
<font color=#FFFF00>on Tae Pyung pretending to be single until he becomes a top singer.</font>

8
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:17,342
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why he couldn't tell her he's married.</font>

9
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:19,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that right?</font>

10
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,502
<font color=#FFFF00>What you said is true.</font>

11
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:24,472
<font color=#FFFF00>What on the earth are you talking about?</font>

12
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Had Dong Sook known...</font>

13
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:28,742
<font color=#FFFF00>that there used to be something between Tae Pyung and her,</font>

14
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>would Dong Sook have done the same thing?</font>

15
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook, if you had known their relationship,</font>

16
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,542
<font color=#FFFF00>would you have let Tae Pyung pretend to be single?</font>

17
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:35,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I must be crazy if I did that.</font>

18
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:37,502
<font color=#FFFF00>She says she wouldn't.</font>

19
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:40,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, there was a misunderstanding,</font>

20
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:43,642
<font color=#FFFF00>but it was rude to grab her by the hair.</font>

21
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:45,702
<font color=#FFFF00>It's her who was rude.</font>

22
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:47,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook told her Tae Pyung was her husband.</font>

23
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:49,672
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, Ms Lee insisted on marrying Tae Pyung.</font>

24
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:52,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so, you could've talked to her instead of grabbing her by the hair.</font>

25
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:55,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you taking her side, not your sister's?</font>

26
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:57,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not taking anyone's side.</font>

27
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,042
<font color=#FFFF00>If Tae Pyung hadn't apologised, we may have been taken...</font>

28
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,902
<font color=#FFFF00>to the police station.</font>

29
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:03,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree. Why are you women so daring?</font>

30
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you scolding us? We didn't do anything wrong.</font>

31
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,442
<font color=#FFFF00>It's her fault for trying to take someone else's man.</font>

32
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:10,342
<font color=#FFFF00>How many times do I have to tell you?</font>

33
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:13,572
<font color=#FFFF00>She thought that Dong Sook was Tae Pyung's cousin.</font>

34
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her I was not his cousin.</font>

35
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:18,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Hee tends to not listen to others...</font>

36
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,142
<font color=#FFFF00>when she wants something.</font>

37
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:22,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Hee? Are taking her side now?</font>

38
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:24,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not taking her side.</font>

39
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:27,102
<font color=#FFFF00>He's just telling the fact.</font>

40
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:29,072
<font color=#FFFF00>What is the fact?</font>

41
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It was her who started an argument.</font>

42
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil, calm down.</font>

43
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I have to calm down? I'm also a member of this family.</font>

44
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:37,242
<font color=#FFFF00>What I meant was...</font>

45
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:38,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

46
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:42,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's call Ms Lee tomorrow and apologise to her, Dong Sook.</font>

47
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I have to tell her I'm sorry?</font>

48
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it hurt your feelings...</font>

49
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:49,002
<font color=#FFFF00>that your first love was seized by the hair?</font>

50
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:51,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mean that...</font>

51
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:54,242
<font color=#FFFF00>The first love always makes a trouble.</font>

52
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:56,502
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sick and tired of the first love.</font>

53
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:58,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is the first love...</font>

54
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:00,902
<font color=#FFFF00>so important to the men in this house?</font>

55
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:03,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do the women in this house always try to pick a fight...</font>

56
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,002
<font color=#FFFF00>whenever something happens?</font>

57
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:08,472
<font color=#FFFF00>This time,</font>

58
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:11,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure they never think about their first love again.</font>

59
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:13,172
<font color=#FFFF00>This time,</font>

60
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make sure the women in this house...</font>

61
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,102
<font color=#FFFF00>never use violence again.</font>

62
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going...</font>

63
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,072
<font color=#FFFF00>to let it slide this time.</font>

64
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying that what happened today is all my fault?</font>

65
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:26,942
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nonsense, Dong Sook.</font>

66
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:29,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet, Dong Jin.</font>

67
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:34,842
<font color=#FFFF00>After Mr Lee left this house,</font>

68
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:37,072
<font color=#FFFF00>the hierarchy of the household is completely disrupted.</font>

69
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:39,442
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't stand it. - Look who's talking!</font>

70
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:41,372
<font color=#FFFF00>As Ms Choi is not at home,</font>

71
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:43,502
<font color=#FFFF00>the husbands are not afraid of their wives.</font>

72
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:45,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm taking this opportunity...</font>

73
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:49,372
<font color=#FFFF00>to make you realise how precious your wives are.</font>

74
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,902
<font color=#FFFF00>From this moment on, the women in this house...</font>

75
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:54,702
<font color=#FFFF00>announce a strike. We won't do any household chores.</font>

76
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:57,502
<font color=#FFFF00>House chores are not a big deal.</font>

77
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:59,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Men can do that without any problem.</font>

78
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:01,542
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Then there's no need to worry.</font>

79
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Ladies, stand up.</font>

80
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:07,902
<font color=#FFFF00>From now on, women will eat and sleep by ourselves.</font>

81
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Men can live among yourselves.</font>

82
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:13,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Cooking is not a big deal.</font>

83
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:14,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Do as you wish.</font>

84
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you still sitting here? Stand up!</font>

85
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:19,542
<font color=#FFFF00>- Follow me. - We...</font>

86
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:21,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here. Let's go inside.</font>

87
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,572
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come in. - Where are you going?</font>

88
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:25,702
<font color=#FFFF00>There...</font>

89
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, you also...</font>

90
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:31,672
<font color=#FFFF00>stand up.</font>

91
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:34,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Why are they doing this?</font>

92
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:42,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying that we should sleep in separate bedrooms, Sam Do?</font>

93
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,202
<font color=#FFFF00>You saw them grabbing her hair a while ago.</font>

94
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Women in this house are so bossy.</font>

95
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,672
<font color=#FFFF00>We should break their spirits.</font>

96
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:49,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, I don't think sleeping separately is a good idea.</font>

97
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,642
<font color=#FFFF00>In addition,</font>

98
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:52,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a newlywed.</font>

99
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,442
<font color=#FFFF00>- I don't want to do that. - Hey.</font>

100
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:56,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin, you're the one who has a problem.</font>

101
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,372
<font color=#FFFF00>From what I heard her say earlier, you should really be careful.</font>

102
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,542
<font color=#FFFF00>He's right.</font>

103
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,942
<font color=#FFFF00>"Be quiet, Dong Jin."</font>

104
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:07,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil is feistier than what I previously thought.</font>

105
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:11,172
<font color=#FFFF00>From the start, we should make things right.</font>

106
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Unless we make it as their fault, we're all dead meat.</font>

107
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. It will be the end for us. We should do that.</font>

108
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,702
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do as what he says. - Goodness.</font>

109
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

110
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:27,472
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

111
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:29,142
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I do with it?</font>

112
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right, Mother?</font>

113
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:32,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

114
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,372
<font color=#FFFF00>That thing...</font>

115
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you do something about that thing?</font>

116
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:38,702
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I do?</font>

117
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:50,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

118
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:54,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I was scared to death.</font>

119
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:56,442
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

120
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,572
<font color=#FFFF00>how did you get in here?</font>

121
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,942
<font color=#FFFF00>The gate was open, so I came in to see whether everything's fine.</font>

122
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:01,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

123
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm out of my mind these days.</font>

124
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:06,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have forgotten to lock the gate.</font>

125
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going to boil the octopus? - Yes.</font>

126
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:11,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to put it on the table for the memorial ceremony.</font>

127
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:13,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won's dad used to like it.</font>

128
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:18,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Good thing you came. I actually wanted to talk to you.</font>

129
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that you rented this house...</font>

130
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,272
<font color=#FFFF00>- and gave it to Hyo Won. - Right.</font>

131
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:25,372
<font color=#FFFF00>As we're broke and the situation reversed,</font>

132
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,772
<font color=#FFFF00>you probably wanted to show off your money.</font>

133
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:27,872
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a misunderstanding.</font>

134
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:29,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether I got it wrong or not,</font>

135
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do anything...</font>

136
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:33,102
<font color=#FFFF00>to pay off the rent for this house soon.</font>

137
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ever think of looking down on me.</font>

138
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,942
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? I will never do that.</font>

139
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,242
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I look down on you?</font>

140
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I will cook the octopus.</font>

141
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:44,142
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go inside and take some rest, Mother.</font>

142
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:46,502
<font color=#FFFF00>What can you do?</font>

143
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:49,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I can cook seafood well. I used to live by the coast.</font>

144
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

145
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:03,172
<font color=#FFFF00>That's gross.</font>

146
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:11,972
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm home. - Hi.</font>

147
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:17,302
<font color=#FFFF00>- Tae Yang. - Hi.</font>

148
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:19,872
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

149
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:20,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Well,</font>

150
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,972
<font color=#FFFF00>- he's preparing the octopus. - Why is he doing that?</font>

151
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:26,872
<font color=#FFFF00>To put it on the table for the memorial ceremony.</font>

152
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Father would enjoy the food since his son-in-law prepared it.</font>

153
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is the son-in-law?</font>

154
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so tricky.</font>

155
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:37,542
<font color=#FFFF00>You've already decided in your mind.</font>

156
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,072
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

157
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to help you?</font>

158
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:44,902
<font color=#FFFF00>First, wash your hands.</font>

159
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, Hyo Won and I can do the work here.</font>

160
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,202
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go inside and take a rest.</font>

161
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:52,642
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I trust you and let you prepare the food?</font>

162
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:54,072
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been living alone for many years.</font>

163
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,672
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a much better cook than you are, Mum.</font>

164
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:00,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I've prepared food with Mum for Dad's memorial before.</font>

165
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:01,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I can cook most things.</font>

166
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:04,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll ask you if I'm not sure.</font>

167
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,302
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

168
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I was shocked because of the octopus. I need to calm down.</font>

169
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ruin the expensive ingredients.</font>

170
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't hesitate to ask me if you're not sure.</font>

171
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,142
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

172
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:26,502
<font color=#FFFF00>do you really know how to prepare these food?</font>

173
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:27,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

174
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,572
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing you can't do.</font>

175
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,342
<font color=#FFFF00>They seem to be so happy.</font>

176
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Yun.</font>

177
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:02,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope I'm not late.</font>

178
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,702
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not. You came just on time.</font>

179
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:09,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you wouldn't come back.</font>

180
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:10,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

181
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:13,072
<font color=#FFFF00>won't leave you.</font>

182
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:14,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't do that...</font>

183
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,672
<font color=#FFFF00>although people expect I would.</font>

184
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:21,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that people think I married you because of money.</font>

185
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to show them that they were wrong.</font>

186
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:24,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

187
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,942
<font color=#FFFF00>doing this just to prove them wrong?</font>

188
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:28,642
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm not.</font>

189
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing this for love.</font>

190
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:34,702
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true...</font>

191
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,802
<font color=#FFFF00>that I was attracted to your wealth at the beginning.</font>

192
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,302
<font color=#FFFF00>You looked like you had everything,</font>

193
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:47,112
<font color=#FFFF00>and I felt that I could risk my everything for a man like you.</font>

194
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:52,002
<font color=#FFFF00>But you protected me even after seeing all of my ugly sides...</font>

195
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:56,972
<font color=#FFFF00>and defended me against your mum saying you have to be with me.</font>

196
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:03,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Seeing that made me realise how much you love me.</font>

197
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:09,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, it's my turn to be there for you.</font>

198
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry for putting you through such a hard time.</font>

199
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:26,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

200
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:36,872
<font color=#FFFF00>We're here, Mum.</font>

201
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Yun.</font>

202
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thanks for coming. - Have you been well?</font>

203
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

204
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:50,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, Ji Yun is here.</font>

205
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:58,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

206
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:01,372
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault, Mum.</font>

207
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be angry at Ji Yun.</font>

208
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive her.</font>

209
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't even apologise after making the company go under.</font>

210
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:11,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you're saying sorry just to defend your wife.</font>

211
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:15,942
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why people say that sons are useless.</font>

212
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:18,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I know that I'm at fault.</font>

213
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:20,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

214
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:24,302
<font color=#FFFF00>She's apologising sincerely. Forgive her, Mum.</font>

215
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:25,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won is right.</font>

216
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:28,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Try putting yourself in Ji Yun's shoes.</font>

217
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:30,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I know for a fact that you won't bother coming back.</font>

218
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:33,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of person do you think I am?</font>

219
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, that hurt. I'm just asking you...</font>

220
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:40,042
<font color=#FFFF00>to understand her since you're so generous.</font>

221
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

222
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen.</font>

223
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:45,042
<font color=#FFFF00>If you leave as you please once again,</font>

224
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,302
<font color=#FFFF00>you will not be able to come back.</font>

225
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:50,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll cut you some slack this time, but that's it.</font>

226
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'll never do it again.</font>

227
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:54,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, what can I do to give you a hand?</font>

228
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:55,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you see?</font>

229
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:58,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to the kitchen and bring out the food.</font>

230
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

231
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:08,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Coming back like this must've been a tough decision to make.</font>

232
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so harsh on her, Mum.</font>

233
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:12,742
<font color=#FFFF00>You always have to take her side, don't you?</font>

234
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyhow,</font>

235
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,802
<font color=#FFFF00>your dad will be glad to see...</font>

236
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,702
<font color=#FFFF00>that his one and only daughter-in-law is back.</font>

237
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:37,042
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

238
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:40,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang made all of the dishes.</font>

239
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:44,142
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for Father's memorial ceremony. Why is he making the food?</font>

240
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:45,642
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not even our family.</font>

241
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,002
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be thanking him for preparing all the food...</font>

242
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,142
<font color=#FFFF00>in your place. What are you even saying now?</font>

243
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:54,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I never asked for help. Does he want me to give him credit or what?</font>

244
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want any credit for this.</font>

245
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:00,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll let you take care of the rest.</font>

246
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:03,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going, Hyo Won.</font>

247
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:06,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Stay for the ceremony...</font>

248
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:07,602
<font color=#FFFF00>and eat with us after.</font>

249
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't be here.</font>

250
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,142
<font color=#FFFF00>You little...</font>

251
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:18,772
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

252
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang, why are you coming out of the kitchen?</font>

253
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:25,772
<font color=#FFFF00>He made all the dishes for Dad's memorial ceremony.</font>

254
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:28,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You and your wife showed up after he took care of all the preparation.</font>

255
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't you be thanking him? How rude.</font>

256
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,702
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my point. Why did he make food for Dad's memorial ceremony?</font>

257
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I should go.</font>

258
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:39,102
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to leave now?</font>

259
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay for the ceremony and have dinner with us.</font>

260
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should he stay for the ceremony?</font>

261
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you lost your mind, Mum?</font>

262
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll visit again soon.</font>

263
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you're so mean!</font>

264
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll see him out.</font>

265
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:59,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe he's expecting us to thank him for making a few dishes.</font>

266
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,572
<font color=#FFFF00>This house.</font>

267
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,072
<font color=#FFFF00>He got it for us.</font>

268
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,702
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - He signed the lease...</font>

269
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,442
<font color=#FFFF00>with the money he earned from the TV commercial.</font>

270
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:10,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so disrespectful to him.</font>

271
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:13,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, is it almsgiving or what? Does he look down on us now?</font>

272
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go teach that guy a lesson.</font>

273
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,702
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where's Hyo Sang going? - What?</font>

274
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:26,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Just go help Ji Yun with setting the table.</font>

275
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,642
<font color=#FFFF00>You, Kang Tae Yang.</font>

276
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:44,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think my family is a big joke now that our company...</font>

277
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:46,542
<font color=#FFFF00>has gone bankrupt?</font>

278
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

279
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You probably got this shabby house for us...</font>

280
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,542
<font color=#FFFF00>so that you can visit us anytime...</font>

281
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,302
<font color=#FFFF00>to belittle us as much as you want.</font>

282
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,802
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's not why I got it. - Don't lie to my face.</font>

283
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,642
<font color=#FFFF00>You got this house for us because we've become homeless.</font>

284
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:02,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you did it so that you can approach Hyo Won more easily.</font>

285
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so twisted?</font>

286
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I got this house...</font>

287
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:07,802
<font color=#FFFF00>because of Hyo Won.</font>

288
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I love her, and I didn't want to see her family having to suffer.</font>

289
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted to help.</font>

290
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you expect me to believe that?</font>

291
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,772
<font color=#FFFF00>She was distressed thinking she couldn't help her family,</font>

292
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:21,702
<font color=#FFFF00>so I wanted to take a load off of her chest. That's why I got it.</font>

293
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:24,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure there were no other reasons?</font>

294
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:26,242
<font color=#FFFF00>My heart is aching because I can't do more for her,</font>

295
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,902
<font color=#FFFF00>and I'm upset as I don't have much to offer.</font>

296
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:32,372
<font color=#FFFF00>So please don't get any wrong ideas and just make yourself at home.</font>

297
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,702
<font color=#FFFF00>That fool. He irks me.</font>

298
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I've been thinking hard.</font>

299
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I think sleeping separately is pushing it too far.</font>

300
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree with Dong Jin, Sam Do.</font>

301
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,902
<font color=#FFFF00>How about we go back to our rooms?</font>

302
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:00,972
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, seriously.</font>

303
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:03,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been living like this for over two decades,</font>

304
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,302
<font color=#FFFF00>so I have no problem with continuing on like this.</font>

305
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:09,002
<font color=#FFFF00>However, I cannot bear to watch my beloved brothers living like me.</font>

306
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:13,142
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how overbearing and bullheaded those women are.</font>

307
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:16,502
<font color=#FFFF00>If we fail to turn the tables this time, we'll have no future.</font>

308
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:18,442
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll spend the rest of your life in agony.</font>

309
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:21,042
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how Sun Nyeo and Dong Sook are.</font>

310
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil would never become like them.</font>

311
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:27,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing this for you guys. Just trust me and follow my lead.</font>

312
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,302
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay for you as you're going through a midlife crisis.</font>

313
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>- But Dong Jin and I are newlyweds. - Exactly.</font>

314
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:35,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, cut it out. You're at it again.</font>

315
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut it and go back to bed. Just sleep!</font>

316
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel as if I'm back in the army.</font>

317
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:45,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh, I'm tired. - What on earth are we doing now?</font>

318
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I overreacted.</font>

319
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:57,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung didn't do anything wrong.</font>

320
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,302
<font color=#FFFF00>You're too nice.</font>

321
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:04,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the one who told him to act like he's single.</font>

322
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:07,872
<font color=#FFFF00>The problem is that he didn't say anything to you...</font>

323
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:10,372
<font color=#FFFF00>after meeting his first love.</font>

324
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,572
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with telling you that he ran into his first love?</font>

325
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,442
<font color=#FFFF00>He definitely should've told you.</font>

326
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:16,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It's obvious that he kept it from you intentionally.</font>

327
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:21,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing good would've come out of her knowing about it from...</font>

328
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:23,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop blabbing away. Just get some sleep.</font>

329
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:24,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Sweet dreams.</font>

330
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:37,442
<font color=#FFFF00>(Tae Pyung)</font>

331
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:41,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm realising that I should've been more thoughtful.</font>

332
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:44,302
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've been honest with you from the get-go.</font>

333
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you meet me in the front yard?</font>

334
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:03,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've been very angry if I were in your position.</font>

335
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:05,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

336
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:11,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think she's over you yet, though.</font>

337
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:13,502
<font color=#FFFF00>We ended everything 15 years ago.</font>

338
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>My immature act haunted me...</font>

339
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,642
<font color=#FFFF00>for a long enough time,</font>

340
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:20,072
<font color=#FFFF00>and there's no reason for me to have feelings for her again now.</font>

341
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to worry you for no reason.</font>

342
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,472
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I didn't tell you.</font>

343
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Please believe me.</font>

344
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about earlier, too.</font>

345
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm cold. What time is it now?</font>

346
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,812
<font color=#FFFF00>It's 3am.</font>

347
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:46,702
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so cold in here.</font>

348
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't skip the exercise tomorrow morning.</font>

349
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:53,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that we're fighting,</font>

350
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,542
<font color=#FFFF00>but the project must go on.</font>

351
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I probably won't be able to get up that early.</font>

352
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:05,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you a wake-up all.</font>

353
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:12,272
<font color=#FFFF00>My phone is on vibrate. What if I can't hear it?</font>

354
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:16,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have hearing problems or what?</font>

355
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Then let's sleep together if you want.</font>

356
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:22,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Then shall we?</font>

357
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

358
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you say you were going on a strike?</font>

359
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:49,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though I'm on a strike,</font>

360
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:51,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stop helping you overcome your menopause, can I?</font>

361
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

362
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:57,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

363
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:04,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Well done.</font>

364
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:06,042
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, you were a bit excessive.</font>

365
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,572
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you let them see you...</font>

366
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,842
<font color=#FFFF00>grappling me, especially in front of the females?</font>

367
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:11,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said,</font>

368
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:14,502
<font color=#FFFF00>whoever lusts over another women's husband should know what to expect.</font>

369
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:16,742
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

370
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,972
<font color=#FFFF00>how should we spend the 50,000 dollars?</font>

371
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:22,472
<font color=#FFFF00>First, let's go to the bank tomorrow and deposit the money.</font>

372
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Afterward, we can think carefully about how we should use it.</font>

373
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:29,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that I think of it,</font>

374
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,702
<font color=#FFFF00>the lucky dream I dreamt before...</font>

375
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,442
<font color=#FFFF00>must have been hinting that we'd get out 50,000 dollars back.</font>

376
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,542
<font color=#FFFF00>This still feels like a dream.</font>

377
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:39,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

378
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:40,642
<font color=#FFFF00>You see...</font>

379
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:43,702
<font color=#FFFF00>- That menopause project... - Yes?</font>

380
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:46,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's actually taking effect already.</font>

381
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:47,602
<font color=#FFFF00>That doesn't make sense.</font>

382
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,372
<font color=#FFFF00>It's only been a few days. How could the training take effect already?</font>

383
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:53,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You really think so?</font>

384
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:54,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

385
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:58,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Then let's turn off the lights and go to bed.</font>

386
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,102
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while since we've been together like this.</font>

387
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:09,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh dear. Sam Do. You're hugging me too tightly.</font>

388
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:17,942
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Hyo Joo.</font>

389
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:21,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Has she lost her mind?</font>

390
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:23,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she here?</font>

391
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:29,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. Welcome, Hyo Joo.</font>

392
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:33,602
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings such a noble person...</font>

393
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:36,142
<font color=#FFFF00>to such a humble place like this?</font>

394
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:37,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

395
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:39,372
<font color=#FFFF00>It does seem a bit humble.

396
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you happy now that you...</font>

397
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:43,142
<font color=#FFFF00>threw us all out and have that big house to yourself now?</font>

398
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:45,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you find yourself smiling for no reason...</font>

399
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:46,812
<font color=#FFFF00>and feel full without even eating?</font>

400
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. That's enough.</font>

401
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:50,102
<font color=#FFFF00>You selfish brat.</font>

402
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:51,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

403
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you want to see for yourself how we're living?</font>

404
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:56,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I came because if we hold a memorial ceremony in two places,</font>

405
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought Dad would get confused. Calm down.</font>

406
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to bow and then I'll leave right away.</font>

407
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. It's only been a year...</font>

408
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:17,442
<font color=#FFFF00>since you passed away.</font>

409
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:21,542
<font color=#FFFF00>But it feels like 10 years.</font>

410
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:25,702
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it feels like it's been more than 100 years since you left.</font>

411
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:31,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Who could that be?</font>

412
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:34,072
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not expecting anyone else.</font>

413
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:37,672
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Lawyer Choi.</font>

414
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:40,272
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

415
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:42,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would he come here?</font>

416
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:53,342
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been, Madam?</font>

417
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:56,002
<font color=#FFFF00>- How does it look like I've been? - What...</font>

418
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:59,002
<font color=#FFFF00>brings you here, Lawyer Choi?</font>

419
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to administer Chairman Min's final will.</font>

420
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by his final will? There's more to his will?</font>

421
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:07,142
<font color=#FFFF00>On the day of the first-year anniversary, Chairman Min...</font>

422
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:10,542
<font color=#FFFF00>left a message for me to deliver to the family.</font>

423
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you are all doing well.</font>

424
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:20,242
<font color=#FFFF00>It's really your father's voice.</font>

425
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:23,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

426
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

427
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Darling.</font>

428
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:32,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't cry and listen to me carefully.</font>

429
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:34,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad says you shouldn't cry,</font>

430
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,572
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't cry, all right?</font>

431
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:39,342
<font color=#FFFF00>If I had a clear mind and a sound body,</font>

432
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've like to have written a letter...</font>

433
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,872
<font color=#FFFF00>to each and every one of you.</font>

434
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:47,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Unfortunately, you all know the condition I'm in.</font>

435
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>So I'm recording my voice when I still can.</font>

436
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:53,302
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all,</font>

437
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,202
<font color=#FFFF00>this is for my dear eldest daughter, Hyo Joo.</font>

438
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:59,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I still don't quite know whether...</font>

439
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:03,072
<font color=#FFFF00>it's right for me to tell you this or not.</font>

440
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:07,442
<font color=#FFFF00>But I think it's about time I am honest with you.</font>

441
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:11,372
<font color=#FFFF00>When your mother was sick but still alive,</font>

442
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I brought your stepmother home.</font>

443
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:17,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm well aware how much that hurt you...</font>

444
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:19,702
<font color=#FFFF00>at such a young age.</font>

445
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,142
<font color=#FFFF00>But Hyo Joo,</font>

446
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:24,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I did that...</font>

447
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:27,102
<font color=#FFFF00>because it was your mother's wish.</font>

448
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,072
<font color=#FFFF00>That doesn't make sense.</font>

449
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:30,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother...</font>

450
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:34,372
<font color=#FFFF00>didn't want you to feel lonely because of her absence.</font>

451
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:37,742
<font color=#FFFF00>So when she knew her time had almost come,</font>

452
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:40,542
<font color=#FFFF00>she had your stepmother move in.</font>

453
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:42,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure she made that decision...</font>

454
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,902
<font color=#FFFF00>because she didn't want her only daughter...</font>

455
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:48,272
<font color=#FFFF00>to feel lonely.</font>

456
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:51,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know you would be so heartbroken...</font>

457
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:55,372
<font color=#FFFF00>and close your heart towards your stepmother and your siblings.</font>

458
00:23:56,472 --> 00:24:00,702
<font color=#FFFF00>At the time, I thought it would be best for everyone.</font>

459
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's too late saying this,</font>

460
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:07,702
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm truly sorry.</font>

461
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:10,602
<font color=#FFFF00>He's lying. That's a lie.</font>

462
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:14,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Say something, Mum.</font>

463
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:17,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Lawyer Choi.</font>

464
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:20,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Please turn off the recorder and give us some time to ourselves.</font>

465
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be outside.</font>

466
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you don't want to believe it,</font>

467
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,372
<font color=#FFFF00>but what your dad said is all true.</font>

468
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:33,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't lie to me.</font>

469
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,072
<font color=#FFFF00>You chased my father when my mum was alive.</font>

470
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:37,072
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

471
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:39,102
<font color=#FFFF00>When your mum was alive,</font>

472
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I met your dad, fell in love and gave birth to Hyo Sang.</font>

473
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:44,202
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my sin.</font>

474
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:47,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't make excuses. I know I'll have to pay for my sins.</font>

475
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,942
<font color=#FFFF00>But I had no desire to take over your mum's place.</font>

476
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,472
<font color=#FFFF00>It was obvious...</font>

477
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:54,242
<font color=#FFFF00>that people would talk behind my back that I kicked out...</font>

478
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,002
<font color=#FFFF00>the wife and took over the household.</font>

479
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Why on earth would I put myself in that sort of situation voluntarily?</font>

480
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mum...</font>

481
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,872
<font color=#FFFF00>asked me to come to the hospital.</font>

482
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,842
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she wouldn't be able to...</font>

483
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:10,702
<font color=#FFFF00>close her eyes thinking that you...</font>

484
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:17,602
<font color=#FFFF00>would be crying alone in an empty room.</font>

485
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:20,372
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

486
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:23,142
<font color=#FFFF00>she asked that I take her place,</font>

487
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:25,242
<font color=#FFFF00>so I could look after your dad...</font>

488
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:27,902
<font color=#FFFF00>and act as a mother to you.</font>

489
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I was the woman that had an affair with her husband,</font>

490
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:32,472
<font color=#FFFF00>yet she entreated me holding my hands.</font>

491
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:36,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't possibly say no to her.</font>

492
00:25:37,342 --> 00:25:39,642
<font color=#FFFF00>You're lying. That's a lie!</font>

493
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:43,542
<font color=#FFFF00>After all this time,</font>

494
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:49,702
<font color=#FFFF00>it may be useless to say such a thing.</font>

495
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:54,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I took over the household,</font>

496
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,242
<font color=#FFFF00>but failed in becoming a good mother to you. I'm sorry.</font>

497
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:01,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

498
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:03,302
<font color=#FFFF00>truly mean this.</font>

499
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,002
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be true.</font>

500
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:07,942
<font color=#FFFF00>What's happening?</font>

501
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:16,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

502
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:32,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

503
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:34,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang.</font>

504
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,872
<font color=#FFFF00>It's dangerous for you to come here alone this late at night.</font>

505
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:45,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What the matter? Is something wrong?</font>

506
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,202
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be great if your mother and sister clear up...</font>

507
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,442
<font color=#FFFF00>all their misunderstandings and reconcile with each other.</font>

508
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:15,102
<font color=#FFFF00>They've been on bad terms for so long.</font>

509
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think it'll be easy.</font>

510
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,472
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm sure things will be better than before.</font>

511
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:22,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. They're family.</font>

512
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:23,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Tae Yang.</font>

513
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you,</font>

514
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:27,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure Dad...</font>

515
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:30,602
<font color=#FFFF00>was pleased and enjoyed his meal.</font>

516
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:35,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope the food suited his taste.</font>

517
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:40,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure your father would've been happy because...</font>

518
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,742
<font color=#FFFF00>your sister-in-law has returned and your sister came today.</font>

519
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:45,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad...</font>

520
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:47,942
<font color=#FFFF00>would've been happy.</font>

521
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Next year, I hope you could be there...</font>

522
00:27:57,472 --> 00:27:59,472
<font color=#FFFF00>at my dad's memorial ceremony.</font>

523
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:01,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll try hard to make that happen.</font>

524
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:03,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

525
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:05,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that mean we'll get married soon?</font>

526
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:07,002
<font color=#FFFF00>We must win your mother's approval first.</font>

527
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:10,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder how nice it would be...</font>

528
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:13,572
<font color=#FFFF00>if you were the first person I see when I open my eyes in the morning.</font>

529
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,302
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make you breakfast.</font>

530
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:17,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll cook dinner.</font>

531
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:21,102
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I can't cook.</font>

532
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:23,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do the dishes.</font>

533
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even do the dishes.</font>

534
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't bear looking at you, let alone make you do chores.</font>

535
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:32,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do everything.</font>

536
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:37,872
<font color=#FFFF00>My married life will be so amazing.</font>

537
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:40,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang in there for me. I'm almost there.</font>

538
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,372
<font color=#FFFF00>However much...</font>

539
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang loves Hyo Won,</font>

540
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:03,542
<font color=#FFFF00>how dare he prepare the food for my dad's memorial.</font>

541
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang can be sweet and thoughtful.</font>

542
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:09,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

543
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:11,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you taking his side?</font>

544
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:15,842
<font color=#FFFF00>After I'd moved out of your house,</font>

545
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:18,072
<font color=#FFFF00>- he came to see me. - Did he?</font>

546
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:19,972
<font color=#FFFF00>He said I'd be trash...</font>

547
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:22,142
<font color=#FFFF00>if I didn't go back to you.</font>

548
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:24,872
<font color=#FFFF00>My heart sunk...</font>

549
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:27,302
<font color=#FFFF00>as I realised how selfish I'd been.</font>

550
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:30,242
<font color=#FFFF00>What gives him the right to say that to my wife?</font>

551
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:34,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he loves your sister very much.</font>

552
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we help them out?</font>

553
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Did you get home safely?</font>

554
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:06,472
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm picking up.</font>

555
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you suddenly care?</font>

556
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:10,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still just as nasty.</font>

557
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:13,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

558
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:15,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Why wouldn't I be?</font>

559
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:17,972
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you feel?</font>

560
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

561
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:23,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I acted out because I got a bit emotional.</font>

562
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:27,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine now.</font>

563
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,572
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's a relief. - Yes.</font>

564
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:32,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying this only because I have liquid courage.</font>

565
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Hyo Joo.</font>

566
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,502
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean it.</font>

567
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I wronged you in many ways.</font>

568
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:45,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess...</font>

569
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,902
<font color=#FFFF00>it's only natural for you to act this way.</font>

570
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:51,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You're drunk.</font>

571
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop drinking and go to bed.</font>

572
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:11,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is the house so cold and empty?</font>

573
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:26,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did the other two go?</font>

574
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:37,302
<font color=#FFFF00>So,</font>

575
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:40,672
<font color=#FFFF00>you could've married into a rich and powerful family.</font>

576
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:42,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't that upset you?</font>

577
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Rather than be son-in-law to a rich man, I want to be...</font>

578
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,202
<font color=#FFFF00>your husband and Da Jeong's dad.</font>

579
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a bit worried.</font>

580
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:55,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Your CEO will be really angry.</font>

581
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:02,172
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

582
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung suggested we have some wine.</font>

583
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,072
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Where's Sam Do?</font>

584
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:10,302
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he's in bed with Sun Nyeo.</font>

585
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,102
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do this?</font>

586
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:15,442
<font color=#FFFF00>We said men with men and women with women.</font>

587
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:18,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we did. That was the original plan,</font>

588
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,202
<font color=#FFFF00>but some things can't be controlled.</font>

589
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:23,372
<font color=#FFFF00>A married couple's fight never really goes on.</font>

590
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,372
<font color=#FFFF00>We're still newlyweds.</font>

591
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:28,302
<font color=#FFFF00>What about me? Aren't I a newlywed?</font>

592
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:42,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Silly.</font>

593
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:45,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

594
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

595
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:50,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't come in here. This is the women's room.</font>

596
00:32:50,372 --> 00:32:52,472
<font color=#FFFF00>It's no longer the women's room.</font>

597
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:55,472
<font color=#FFFF00>- The others are with their spouses. - What?</font>

598
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:58,572
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so silly not to even notice.</font>

599
00:33:00,972 --> 00:33:04,472
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you sleep so deep you didn't notice them leave?</font>

600
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:07,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you're so imperceptive.</font>

601
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:08,742
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

602
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:12,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt so alone without you. I couldn't sleep.</font>

603
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:15,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Seeing you sleep so well made me feel bad.</font>

604
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:18,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even talk about it. I'd tossed and turned...</font>

605
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,272
<font color=#FFFF00>and had only just fallen asleep.</font>

606
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:24,172
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a lie. You need just one minute.</font>

607
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,372
<font color=#FFFF00>One minute?</font>

608
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:29,002
<font color=#FFFF00>You fall asleep a minute after your head hits the pillow.</font>

609
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:30,742
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

610
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum called earlier today.</font>

611
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:36,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Is something wrong?</font>

612
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:39,802
<font color=#FFFF00>No. She went for a stroll with Dad along the beach...</font>

613
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:42,742
<font color=#FFFF00>and saw a little baby.</font>

614
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:45,902
<font color=#FFFF00>She said the baby looked so cute.</font>

615
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:50,442
<font color=#FFFF00>She wants us to have a child soon.</font>

616
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:52,672
<font color=#FFFF00>We only just got married.</font>

617
00:33:53,502 --> 00:33:54,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's...</font>

618
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:57,142
<font color=#FFFF00>do this for them.</font>

619
00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:00,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's give them a grandchild to hold.</font>

620
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:02,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

621
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:06,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not? I can't wait to have a daughter that looks like you.</font>

622
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:07,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you?</font>

623
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:11,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Not me. I want to have a son that looks like you.</font>

624
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:15,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Who cares if it's a boy or a girl?</font>

625
00:34:16,212 --> 00:34:17,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's have it first.</font>

626
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:21,102
<font color=#FFFF00>It's what my parents want.</font>

627
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:23,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we?</font>

628
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:25,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

629
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

630
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:32,442
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. Be still.</font>

631
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Things got almost brutal last night when you...</font>

632
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:42,972
<font color=#FFFF00>decided to go men versus women.</font>

633
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is everyone grinning this morning?</font>

634
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:48,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Da Jeong, fights between a married couple...</font>

635
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,002
<font color=#FFFF00>never really last.</font>

636
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:52,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

637
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:53,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

638
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:55,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's all eat.</font>

639
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:59,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Just so you all know, I cooked breakfast this morning.</font>

640
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:01,972
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

641
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:04,212
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thanks for cooking. - Sure.</font>

642
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,742
<font color=#FFFF00>The soup's nice.</font>

643
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:10,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if Father and Mother are eating properly.</font>

644
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we video-call them?</font>

645
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Can your grandpa do that?</font>

646
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You bet.</font>

647
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:19,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I taught him all that before he left for Gangneung.</font>

648
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:21,472
<font color=#FFFF00>He's smart.</font>

649
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:23,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Look over here.</font>

650
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:28,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey. - You're sophisticated, Dad.</font>

651
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:30,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you sleep well, Mr Lee?</font>

652
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:32,712
<font color=#FFFF00>- Good morning. - Good morning.</font>

653
00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:36,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing very well, thanks to you all.</font>

654
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,502
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you doing, Dad?</font>

655
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:42,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mum followed me all day to look after me,</font>

656
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:45,072
<font color=#FFFF00>and she's sleeping in because she's tired.</font>

657
00:35:46,172 --> 00:35:48,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm cooking breakfast instead.</font>

658
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you preparing breakfast?</font>

659
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:54,672
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very simple. Some bread, milk and fruit.</font>

660
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful with fire and knives, Father.</font>

661
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no problem with those yet.</font>

662
00:35:59,212 --> 00:36:01,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you enjoying your newlywed life?</font>

663
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:04,472
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - This weekend,</font>

664
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:07,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll visit you with my uncle and aunt. See you then.</font>

665
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:11,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Don't you worry about me.</font>

666
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Look after yourselves. Out.</font>

667
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodbye. - Bye.</font>

668
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,302
<font color=#FFFF00>He hung up.</font>

669
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:25,142
<font color=#FFFF00>(Grand Opening)</font>

670
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:46,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she Mr Lee Dong Jin's wife?</font>

671
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:50,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. She works at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop...</font>

672
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:52,842
<font color=#FFFF00>and supports her husband well, I heard.</font>

673
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:56,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Mr Lee found himself a great wife.</font>

674
00:36:57,372 --> 00:37:00,642
<font color=#FFFF00>What a lovely couple. They suit each other.</font>

675
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:06,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules...</font>

676
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:11,142
<font color=#FFFF00>to attend the opening of the Tonelli-Wolgyesu store.</font>

677
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,972
<font color=#FFFF00>As you know, Tonelli...</font>

678
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:18,042
<font color=#FFFF00>is a famous brand that boasts great skill and technology.</font>

679
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Wolgyesu has a history that goes back 100 years,</font>

680
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,672
<font color=#FFFF00>making it Korea's best tailor store.</font>

681
00:37:24,302 --> 00:37:26,712
<font color=#FFFF00>The launching of the Tonelli-Wolgyesu brand...</font>

682
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,042
<font color=#FFFF00>means that...</font>

683
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:31,072
<font color=#FFFF00>our skill and tradition has been accepted overseas.</font>

684
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:35,002
<font color=#FFFF00>We will upgrade the domestic bespoke suit market...</font>

685
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,772
<font color=#FFFF00>that caters to Asian body types...</font>

686
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:40,542
<font color=#FFFF00>as we aim to become a major player in the Asian fashion market.</font>

687
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,972
<font color=#FFFF00>We will do our best. Thank you.</font>

688
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:58,242
<font color=#FFFF00>- About the emblem. - It's great.</font>

689
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I am Bae Sam Do, the Master Tailor.</font>

690
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:03,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Standing next to me is Min Hyo Sang.</font>

691
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:06,102
<font color=#FFFF00>He worked at Meesa Apparel and is currently our intern.</font>

692
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,442
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please feel free to look around. - Thank you.</font>

693
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:19,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Gianni.</font>

694
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:22,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Min Hyo Joo,</font>

695
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:25,272
<font color=#FFFF00>the director of Meesa Cultural Foundation.</font>

696
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:26,772
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a pleasure to meet you as well.</font>

697
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:29,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm looking forward to seeing...</font>

698
00:38:29,102 --> 00:38:31,002
<font color=#FFFF00>the future of Wolgyesu-Tonelli collaboration.</font>

699
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:34,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Please know that Meesa Cultural Foundation...</font>

700
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:36,372
<font color=#FFFF00>will be giving our full support.</font>

701
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:40,072
<font color=#FFFF00>And even though Mr Lee and I...</font>

702
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,172
<font color=#FFFF00>are now separated as you know,</font>

703
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:45,102
<font color=#FFFF00>we're professionally on excellent terms.</font>

704
00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:47,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, Dong Jin.</font>

705
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:48,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

706
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:50,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you the director of Meesa Cultural Foundation, Ms Min Hyo Joo?</font>

707
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr Lee's ex-wife. - Yes, I am.</font>

708
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:56,072
<font color=#FFFF00>What made you decide to attend this occasion?</font>

709
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,472
<font color=#FFFF00>We got divorced due to various circumstances,</font>

710
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:01,872
<font color=#FFFF00>but we're still good friends...</font>

711
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,372
<font color=#FFFF00>who are rooting for each other.</font>

712
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:13,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Marriage as a system...</font>

713
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,072
<font color=#FFFF00>isn't that important for people like us.</font>

714
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. - Thank you for coming.</font>

715
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:30,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. You're Mr Lee's wife, right?</font>

716
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:31,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

717
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yes.</font>

718
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:36,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that you work as a tailor at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

719
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:39,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you join the shop for your husband?</font>

720
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:40,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to know more about your love story.</font>

721
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,102
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what happened. I'm...</font>

722
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,472
<font color=#FFFF00>From what I know,</font>

723
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Na worked a bunch of odd jobs after graduating high school...</font>

724
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:52,002
<font color=#FFFF00>before getting her first job at the shop.</font>

725
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:55,272
<font color=#FFFF00>She started out as an errand runner. Aren't I right?</font>

726
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:00,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though she didn't go to college,</font>

727
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:03,712
<font color=#FFFF00>she's working hard to become the best female tailor...</font>

728
00:40:03,712 --> 00:40:04,972
<font color=#FFFF00>in the country.</font>

729
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:16,942
<font color=#FFFF00>That was petty.</font>

730
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you mean? - You've been...</font>

731
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:20,972
<font color=#FFFF00>stomping all over Yun Shil on purpose.</font>

732
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:22,872
<font color=#FFFF00>She got all flustered and couldn't answer,</font>

733
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:24,342
<font color=#FFFF00>so I just helped her out a little.</font>

734
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:27,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be like that to her.</font>

735
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been working with her closely,</font>

736
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:30,742
<font color=#FFFF00>so I know that she's a nice, good-hearted person.</font>

737
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:33,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop being so mean to her.</font>

738
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:37,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't lecture me. Sort out your own mess first.</font>

739
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:43,242
<font color=#FFFF00>That temper of hers.</font>

740
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:45,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How vicious. That's obviously why...</font>

741
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:47,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin fell head over heels for Yun Shil who's kind-hearted.</font>

742
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you. Why are you just standing here?</font>

743
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:54,572
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be walking around to check if the guests need anything...</font>

744
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:57,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hands out of your pockets now. - Gosh, I'm so sick...</font>

745
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:58,672
<font color=#FFFF00>and tired of your nagging.</font>

746
00:40:58,842 --> 00:41:01,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to retrieve my job so that I won't have to put up with this.</font>

747
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:04,842
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't be easy.</font>

748
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:06,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to learn how to sew.</font>

749
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:08,672
<font color=#FFFF00>After that, you have to learn how to iron and use the sewing machine.</font>

750
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:09,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Then taking measurements.</font>

751
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:21,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for coming.</font>

752
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:25,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you looking for someone? - Have you seen Yun Shil?</font>

753
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:26,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I saw her here.</font>

754
00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:28,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she stepped out.</font>

755
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:29,902
<font color=#FFFF00>- She stepped out? - Yes.</font>

756
00:41:30,102 --> 00:41:31,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

757
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:33,142
<font color=#FFFF00>There you are, Mr Lee.</font>

758
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:35,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations. - It's nice to see you.</font>

759
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:36,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you for coming. - My pleasure.</font>

760
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:37,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Feel free to browse around. - Thank you.</font>

761
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I feel so pathetic?</font>

762
00:41:51,672 --> 00:41:52,672
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh.</font>

763
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you back so early?</font>

764
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:56,572
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did something happen? - No.</font>

765
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:59,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just not feeling well.</font>

766
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Please either fire Ms Lee Dong Sook...</font>

767
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:10,842
<font color=#FFFF00>or annul the contract with us.</font>

768
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:12,372
<font color=#FFFF00>The choice is yours.</font>

769
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:13,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Ms Lee.</font>

770
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:17,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand that you're angry, but the contract can't be annulled.</font>

771
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't let your personal feelings affect your work.</font>

772
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:22,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut it, lady.</font>

773
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,642
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

774
00:42:26,642 --> 00:42:28,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you let her go?</font>

775
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:30,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Or shall we annul the contract?</font>

776
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:33,212
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a great opportunity for you.</font>

777
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:37,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell her that you'll fire me.</font>

778
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:40,542
<font color=#FFFF00>My choice is obvious.</font>

779
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course...</font>

780
00:42:55,212 --> 00:42:56,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I'll...</font>

781
00:42:57,802 --> 00:42:59,302
<font color=#FFFF00>choose Dong Sook.</font>

782
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:02,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's annul the contract.</font>

783
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:06,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung.</font>

784
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:09,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, if that's your decision,</font>

785
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:10,972
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll have to return the car...</font>

786
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:12,102
<font color=#FFFF00>and work without a stylist.</font>

787
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:14,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll also have to do all the legwork yourself...</font>

788
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:16,742
<font color=#FFFF00>to book TV shows and events.</font>

789
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:20,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll figure something out.</font>

790
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:21,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It should be fine.</font>

791
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:23,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung.</font>

792
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:26,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry, Dong Sook.</font>

793
00:43:41,172 --> 00:43:43,872
<font color=#FFFF00>We can offer 3,000 dollars for this purse.</font>

794
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:46,002
<font color=#FFFF00>That is crazy.</font>

795
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:49,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know much I paid for this baby? 3,000 won't cut it.</font>

796
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:52,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought it last year and only used it a few times.</font>

797
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:55,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I should take it elsewhere.</font>

798
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:58,772
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the going rate. You won't get more even if you go elsewhere.</font>

799
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:00,302
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that it's a second-hand,</font>

800
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>but I should get at least half of what I paid. This is so crazy.</font>

801
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:05,972
<font color=#FFFF00>How about just 200 more?</font>

802
00:44:05,972 --> 00:44:07,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm afraid I can't do that.</font>

803
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:10,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so difficult.</font>

804
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:14,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I want 200 more. This is...</font>

805
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:16,672
<font color=#FFFF00>a limited-edition purse from the brand's SS collection last year.</font>

806
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:18,702
<font color=#FFFF00>This baby is very special.</font>

807
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:19,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

808
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:24,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You know who I am, right?</font>

809
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:25,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I've seen you on TV.</font>

810
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:27,702
<font color=#FFFF00>You're an announcer, right?</font>

811
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:30,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I am.</font>

812
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:33,072
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother-in-law...</font>

813
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:35,042
<font color=#FFFF00>has so many purses and jewellery pieces.</font>

814
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:37,742
<font color=#FFFF00>She wants to get rid of the things that she doesn't really use,</font>

815
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:39,902
<font color=#FFFF00>so please give her a good deal.</font>

816
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like my autograph?</font>

817
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:44,702
<font color=#FFFF00>You're...</font>

818
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:46,842
<font color=#FFFF00>one of my favourite announcers.</font>

819
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:48,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take good care of her.</font>

820
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:50,972
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just a moment, please. - Thank you.</font>

821
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:54,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You impressed me there.</font>

822
00:44:54,602 --> 00:44:57,302
<font color=#FFFF00>You're selling your beloved purses and jewellery pieces.</font>

823
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,842
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the least I can do as your daughter-in-law.</font>

824
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:14,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang!</font>

825
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:24,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to tell you good news.</font>

826
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:27,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Good news? What is it?</font>

827
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:39,202
<font color=#FFFF00>(Certificate of Appointment, Kang Tae Yang)</font>

833
00:45:51,642 --> 00:45:52,942
<font color=#FFFF00>You got a post?</font>

834
00:45:54,102 --> 00:45:56,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy for you. Congratulations, Tae Yang.</font>

835
00:45:59,502 --> 00:46:00,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

836
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:02,472
<font color=#FFFF00>There's one more.</font>

837
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:06,802
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

838
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:10,442

846
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:32,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Tae Yang.</font>

847
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:35,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you marry me?</font>

848
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:38,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

849
00:46:38,602 --> 00:46:39,902
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't even have to ask.</font>

850
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:52,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

851
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:54,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for accepting my proposal.</font>

852
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:59,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to take you to somewhere fancy,</font>

853
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:01,742
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was in such a rush to share the good news with you.</font>

854
00:47:03,672 --> 00:47:04,902
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so sweet.</font>

855
00:47:05,942 --> 00:47:07,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to forget...</font>

856
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:09,042
<font color=#FFFF00>this moment for the rest of my life.</font>

857
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it such good news?</font>

858
00:48:18,302 --> 00:48:19,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait a minute.</font>

859
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:22,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so nervous? It's not like you.</font>

860
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:30,002
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. But I can't help being nervous.</font>

861
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that?</font>

862
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:43,502
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a pill to calm myself down.</font>

863
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:47,972
<font color=#FFFF00>My heart was beating so fast, I bought at the chemist's earlier.</font>

864
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:52,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly, I'm a bit nervous myself.</font>

865
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Then do you want to share this?</font>

866
00:49:36,972 --> 00:49:37,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Why...</font>

867
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,502
<font color=#FFFF00>are you bowing all of a sudden?</font>

868
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,942
<font color=#FFFF00>(Certificate of Appointment)</font>

869
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:51,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I received this certificate from the Education Office today.</font>

870
00:49:51,102 --> 00:49:52,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it you want to say?</font>

871
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:55,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me marry Hyo Won.</font>

872
00:49:56,172 --> 00:49:58,672
<font color=#FFFF00>With just a certificate like this,</font>

873
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:00,372
<font color=#FFFF00>don't you think you're acting too arrogant?</font>

874
00:50:01,072 --> 00:50:04,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by just a certificate?</font>

875
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:06,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you kidding me?</font>

876
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I know I can make Hyo Won happy.</font>

877
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Please. I ask for your approval.</font>

878
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, Mum.</font>

879
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:18,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You've spent enough time with him to get to know him.</font>

880
00:50:18,502 --> 00:50:21,942
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no one in the world as honest...</font>

881
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:23,842
<font color=#FFFF00>and consistent as Tae Yang.</font>

882
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:25,442
<font color=#FFFF00>You're blinded by love.</font>

883
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,542
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I'm blinded by love.</font>

884
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:30,342
<font color=#FFFF00>But I promise you, Mother.</font>

885
00:50:30,602 --> 00:50:32,542
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll live the rest of our lives like this.</font>

886
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:34,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand listening to this nonsense.</font>

887
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:37,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't spoil this. Be quiet, will you?</font>

888
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:40,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won. You shouldn't act like that to your older brother.</font>

889
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,702
<font color=#FFFF00>All of you, be quiet.</font>

890
00:50:43,702 --> 00:50:46,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand that you'll become a teacher soon,</font>

891
00:50:46,372 --> 00:50:48,142
<font color=#FFFF00>but what will you two live off of for the time being?</font>

892
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,742
<font color=#FFFF00>We've gone bankrupt, and as far as I know,</font>

893
00:50:50,742 --> 00:50:52,902
<font color=#FFFF00>the money you used to get this house was your entire fortune.</font>

894
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:54,602
<font color=#FFFF00>If you approve of our marriage,</font>

895
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:56,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure to take care of the practical issues.</font>

896
00:50:56,802 --> 00:50:59,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. We'll take care of everything.</font>

897
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:02,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't worry and give us your approval.</font>

898
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:10,772
<font color=#FFFF00>If you make an account, I assure you, you won't regret it.</font>

899
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:14,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Such a thing shouldn't happen, but just in case,</font>

900
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:18,502
<font color=#FFFF00>you can get compensation if there's a fire in the market or store.</font>

901
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,142
<font color=#FFFF00>- The terms do sound good. - Of course.</font>

902
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:24,602
<font color=#FFFF00>But unfortunately, we've put the store up for sale.</font>

903
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:25,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

904
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:30,042
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll be moving to Busan due to a family affair.</font>

905
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:31,672
<font color=#FFFF00>That far away?</font>

906
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I've become so fond of you.</font>

907
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:36,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Me, too.</font>

908
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,942
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. Mrs Bok.</font>

909
00:51:39,342 --> 00:51:43,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone praises you for your cooking skills.</font>

910
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:46,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you take over our grocery store?</font>

911
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:47,802
<font color=#FFFF00>- Me? - Yes.</font>

912
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:50,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no choice but to put up the store,</font>

913
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:53,302
<font color=#FFFF00>but we have a lot of regular customers.</font>

914
00:51:53,302 --> 00:51:55,002
<font color=#FFFF00>This store brings quite a good income.</font>

915
00:51:55,002 --> 00:51:57,102
<font color=#FFFF00>That I know, of course.</font>

916
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:58,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

917
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:01,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't want to give it up to a stranger.</font>

918
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:13,272
<font color=#FFFF00>You're late.</font>

919
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I had some urgent matters to care of at the office.</font>

920
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:18,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Yun Shil?</font>

921
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:23,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin. Yun Shil isn't feeling too well.</font>

922
00:52:23,302 --> 00:52:25,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Is she sick?</font>

923
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:28,442
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think so. Earlier, at the opening ceremony,</font>

924
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:30,972
<font color=#FFFF00>you must have done something wrong.</font>

925
00:52:31,072 --> 00:52:32,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I do wrong?</font>

926
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:35,042
<font color=#FFFF00>According to Ms Geum, she's been in a bad mood...</font>

927
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,472
<font color=#FFFF00>ever since the opening ceremony.</font>

928
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:38,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder what's wrong.</font>

929
00:52:38,972 --> 00:52:42,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Us men could never understand women's profound thoughts.</font>

930
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:44,172
<font color=#FFFF00>That indeed is true.</font>

931
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:49,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Most women often tend to get upset and act grouchy...</font>

932
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:51,502
<font color=#FFFF00>without telling us the reason.</font>

933
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Men can never in their own nature...</font>

934
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,472
<font color=#FFFF00>find out the reasons on their own.</font>

935
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Therefore, when you're just dating,</font>

936
00:52:57,772 --> 00:53:00,002
<font color=#FFFF00>you can be let off by just apologizing.</font>

937
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,842
<font color=#FFFF00>However, once you get married, you shouldn't use that method.</font>

938
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:03,642
<font color=#FFFF00>It's important that you become the forestaller from the beginning.</font>

939
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:05,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Otherwise, she'll end up controlling you for the rest of your life.</font>

940
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:07,142
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nonsense.</font>

941
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you just laugh?</font>

942
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You should pay attention to our advice.</font>

943
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he just laugh?</font>

944
00:53:12,342 --> 00:53:14,072
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - What Tae Pyung said is true.</font>

945
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:15,842
<font color=#FFFF00>The first argument after getting married is most importance.</font>

946
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:18,042
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't take control, you'll end up being controlled.</font>

947
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:20,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to end up like me? Do you? Look at me.</font>

948
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:23,742
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough. I'll take care of this on my own.</font>

949
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,142
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't seem like he can do this on his own.</font>

950
00:53:30,142 --> 00:53:33,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. His eyes looked too soft. This doesn't look good.</font>

951
00:53:34,302 --> 00:53:37,372
<font color=#FFFF00>He should've have taken our advice seriously.</font>

952
00:53:40,102 --> 00:53:41,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Where could have she gone?</font>

953
00:53:57,372 --> 00:53:59,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here when we have our room?</font>

954
00:53:59,372 --> 00:54:01,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to sleep here tonight.</font>

955
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:04,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something upsetting happen today?</font>

956
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:08,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong. You'll have to tell me in order to know.</font>

957
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:12,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Please get up and talk to me.</font>

958
00:54:16,472 --> 00:54:20,002
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so frustrating. What's wrong?</font>

959
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:22,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I make you frustrated?</font>

960
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:25,642
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what I meant.</font>

961
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:28,372
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just that I can see you're upset, but since you're not talking,</font>

962
00:54:28,372 --> 00:54:29,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what the problem is.</font>

963
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:34,802
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You don't have to tell me. Let's just go back to our room.</font>

964
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:37,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to. I'm going to sleep here alone.</font>

965
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:39,802
<font color=#FFFF00>We're already using separate rooms? We're newlyweds.</font>

966
00:54:39,802 --> 00:54:41,002
<font color=#FFFF00>This will become a habit.</font>

967
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:45,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyhow, I refuse to speak with you.</font>

968
00:54:50,702 --> 00:54:52,542
<font color=#FFFF00>What could be the problem? Why is she acting that way?</font>

969
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:58,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you coming out of that room?</font>

970
00:54:58,902 --> 00:54:59,902
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

971
00:54:59,902 --> 00:55:01,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you argue with Dong Jin?</font>

972
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:02,872
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't argue,</font>

973
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:05,272
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm just a bit upset with him.</font>

974
00:55:05,572 --> 00:55:07,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Dong Jin do something wrong?</font>

975
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:09,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Not exactly.</font>

976
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:11,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just so mad for some reason.</font>

977
00:55:11,372 --> 00:55:13,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Then that means he did something wrong.</font>

978
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:16,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Women don't get upset for no reason.</font>

979
00:55:16,242 --> 00:55:18,842
<font color=#FFFF00>It means Dong Jin somehow made you upset.</font>

980
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:20,542
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that.</font>

981
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,602
<font color=#FFFF00>It could be because of my inferiority complex.</font>

982
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:23,742
<font color=#FFFF00>No. You're wrong.</font>

983
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,442
<font color=#FFFF00>When you're upset, you should just express it.</font>

984
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:28,642
<font color=#FFFF00>If you act nice and try to understand everything,</font>

985
00:55:28,642 --> 00:55:31,372
<font color=#FFFF00>men will start to look down on you.</font>

986
00:55:31,372 --> 00:55:34,472
<font color=#FFFF00>In the first argument as newlyweds, who takes control...</font>

987
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,102
<font color=#FFFF00>will change everything.</font>

988
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:38,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure not to be defeated.</font>

989
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:40,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

990
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:43,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk.</font>

991
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have anything to say to you.</font>

992
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she acting liking this?</font>

993
00:55:49,542 --> 00:55:51,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't put ideas into her head.</font>

994
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:56,642
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the way to do it. Be strong.</font>

995
00:55:56,642 --> 00:56:00,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm her sister-in-law. Shouldn't I take Dong Jin's side?</font>

996
00:56:00,672 --> 00:56:02,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't act as her sister-in-law.</font>

997
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:04,542
<font color=#FFFF00>As a female, you should take Yun Shil's side.</font>

998
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:06,202
<font color=#FFFF00>You think so? That would be better, right?</font>

999
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:07,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Indeed.</font>

1000
00:56:07,972 --> 00:56:08,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go see.</font>

1001
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:20,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Where do you think you're going?</font>

1002
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. I want to be alone.</font>

1003
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:23,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Using separate rooms is out of the question.</font>

1004
00:56:27,872 --> 00:56:28,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

1005
00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:33,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

1006
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:35,642
<font color=#FFFF00>During the years that you wasted,</font>

1007
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,142
<font color=#FFFF00>you regretted being unable to pursue your studies the most.</font>

1008
00:56:38,142 --> 00:56:40,342
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought about what I could do for you,</font>

1009
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:43,942
<font color=#FFFF00>and I decided I want to support you so that you could pursue your dream.</font>

1010
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:46,942
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a register card for a college entrance exam preparatory institute.</font>

1011
00:56:47,502 --> 00:56:49,702
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? It's too late.</font>

1012
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:50,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean it's too late?</font>

1013
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:53,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You can study hard and enter a college.</font>

1014
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:56,142
<font color=#FFFF00>You've always wanted to study fashion. Once you enter college,</font>

1015
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,672
<font color=#FFFF00>you can study that field professionally.</font>

1016
00:56:57,672 --> 00:56:59,542
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't looked at books in years.</font>

1017
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:01,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I can do it.</font>

1018
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:05,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Why worry when you have an excellent tutor right here?</font>

1019
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:08,972
<font color=#FFFF00>When I was in college, I tutored many students as a part-time job.</font>

1020
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:12,042
<font color=#FFFF00>All of my students went to prestigious schools.</font>

1021
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:14,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so,</font>

1022
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:16,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I have work to do at the tailor shop and chores to do in the household.</font>

1023
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:19,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll help you with that as well.</font>

1024
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:22,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be your husband, tutor as well as a housekeeper.</font>

1025
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,302
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take on three roles.</font>

1026
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,372
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll be difficult, but I can do it.</font>

1027
00:57:30,372 --> 00:57:32,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You're happy that you married me, aren't you?</font>

1028
00:57:34,172 --> 00:57:36,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you feel better now?</font>

1029
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:41,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You sure met an amazing husband, didn't you?</font>

1030
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:43,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I sure did.</font>

1031
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:46,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You were upset one minute and now you're smiling. You're too easy.</font>

1032
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here.</font>

1033
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,272
<font color=#FFFF00>My pretty, pretty, nice wife.</font>

1034
00:57:59,072 --> 00:58:01,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I told him to take control.</font>

1035
00:58:01,372 --> 00:58:03,302
<font color=#FFFF00>He's obviously been defeated.</font>

1036
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:05,972
<font color=#FFFF00>That ended too easily.</font>

1037
00:58:06,372 --> 00:58:08,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I was impressed by Dong Jin though.</font>

1038
00:58:08,302 --> 00:58:11,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Me, too. Yun Shil must be so happy.</font>

1039
00:58:11,202 --> 00:58:12,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you jealous?</font>

1040
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,902
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want, I could support you anytime.</font>

1041
00:58:15,002 --> 00:58:16,372
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I don't want that.</font>

1042
00:58:16,572 --> 00:58:18,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate studying.</font>

1043
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:20,272
<font color=#FFFF00>No thanks.</font>

1044
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:24,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo, why don't you register for an institute this time...</font>

1045
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:25,972
<font color=#FFFF00>and get a high school diploma.</font>

1046
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:29,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going?</font>

1047
00:58:37,772 --> 00:58:38,802
<font color=#FFFF00>May I come in for a minute?</font>

1048
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:40,872
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1049
00:58:43,372 --> 00:58:44,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you go to bed?</font>

1050
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you, Mum?</font>

1051
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I have many thoughts,</font>

1052
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:52,372
<font color=#FFFF00>so I couldn't sleep.</font>

1053
00:58:52,372 --> 00:58:55,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you thinking about Hyo Won and Tae Yang?</font>

1054
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you...</font>

1055
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:02,442
<font color=#FFFF00>let them get married?</font>

1056
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:06,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang.</font>

1057
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:08,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you saying that? Are you all right?</font>

1058
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:10,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I've seen a lot of people, but there's no one...</font>

1059
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:12,302
<font color=#FFFF00>who is as good as Tae Yang.</font>

1060
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Even I think he's a nice guy.</font>

1061
00:59:16,672 --> 00:59:19,542
<font color=#FFFF00>You had a tantrum saying never to let them get married a while ago.</font>

1062
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:22,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I did that because I was grumpy...</font>

1063
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:25,102
<font color=#FFFF00>to see that he was so confident all the time.</font>

1064
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:27,072
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a good man...</font>

1065
00:59:27,502 --> 00:59:28,972
<font color=#FFFF00>and treats Hyo Won well.</font>

1066
00:59:29,302 --> 00:59:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, if he becomes a teacher,</font>

1067
00:59:30,572 --> 00:59:32,142
<font color=#FFFF00>he has income enough to live on.</font>

1068
00:59:32,372 --> 00:59:34,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang!</font>

1069
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:37,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really moved.</font>

1070
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much.</font>

1071
00:59:38,872 --> 00:59:40,642
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? It's weird.</font>

1072
00:59:42,802 --> 00:59:44,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you that happy?</font>

1073
00:59:44,602 --> 00:59:46,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very happy. I'm too happy to death.</font>

1074
00:59:46,902 --> 00:59:48,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Once you get married,</font>

1075
00:59:48,372 --> 00:59:50,972
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll realise that it was happiest when you were with me.</font>

1076
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:53,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang.</font>

1077
00:59:54,002 --> 00:59:55,042
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1078
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:03,942
<font color=#FFFF00>- Long time no see. - How are you?</font>

1079
01:00:03,942 --> 01:00:05,802
<font color=#FFFF00>- I meet you here. - Right.</font>

1080
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:35,102
<font color=#FFFF00>She is so beautiful.</font>

1081
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:38,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't realise that a traditional wedding would be like this.</font>

1082
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:39,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that they won a competition,</font>

1083
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>so they can have a wedding for free.</font>

1084
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:44,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

1085
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:48,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang is good at writing. He wrote a story...</font>

1086
01:00:48,872 --> 01:00:50,472
<font color=#FFFF00>and won the competition.</font>

1087
01:00:51,772 --> 01:00:53,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fortunate to have him as a son-in-law.</font>

1088
01:00:55,642 --> 01:00:58,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you don't have a good daughter-in-law?</font>

1089
01:00:59,802 --> 01:01:01,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, you're...</font>

1090
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:04,672
<font color=#FFFF00>not bad.</font>

1091
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:09,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won, you're so beautiful.</font>

1092
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:10,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum!</font>

1093
01:01:11,342 --> 01:01:12,372
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1094
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:15,272
<font color=#FFFF00>You're excited.</font>

1095
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you that happy to get married? - Yes.</font>

1096
01:01:17,602 --> 01:01:20,602
<font color=#FFFF00>They say a bride should not smile too much, so I'm holding it back.</font>

1097
01:01:20,702 --> 01:01:22,142
<font color=#FFFF00>But I can't help it.</font>

1098
01:01:22,672 --> 01:01:25,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop acting like a child.</font>

1099
01:01:26,672 --> 01:01:28,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You would understand how I feel once you get married...</font>

1100
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:30,142
<font color=#FFFF00>and have a hard time.</font>

1101
01:01:31,742 --> 01:01:34,002
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know anything about housekeeping.</font>

1102
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:36,102
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you going to live after you get married?</font>

1103
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,502
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so worried.</font>

1104
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:42,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry, Mum.</font>

1105
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:45,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang said that he wouldn't let me face hardship.</font>

1106
01:01:45,242 --> 01:01:46,602
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he wouldn't let me wash the dishes.</font>

1107
01:01:48,602 --> 01:01:50,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you believe that, Hyo Won?</font>

1108
01:01:51,102 --> 01:01:52,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I surely do.</font>

1109
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:54,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang would never tell a lie.</font>

1110
01:01:56,942 --> 01:01:59,202
<font color=#FFFF00>He says he'll do anything if you marry him.</font>

1111
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:02,002
<font color=#FFFF00>But once you live with him, it's hard to keep half of those promises.</font>

1112
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:15,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll live happily with Tae Yang.</font>

1113
01:02:15,672 --> 01:02:17,502
<font color=#FFFF00>And be there for each other.</font>

1114
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:20,542
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll be all right, so don't worry, Mum.</font>

1115
01:02:24,372 --> 01:02:26,072
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels like it was only yesterday...</font>

1116
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:29,972
<font color=#FFFF00>when you were a little baby and crying in my arms.</font>

1117
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:34,242
<font color=#FFFF00>You're all grown up already and getting married.</font>

1118
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:39,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Time flies.</font>

1119
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:43,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, thank you...</font>

1120
01:02:44,072 --> 01:02:46,942
<font color=#FFFF00>for giving birth to me and raising me so well.</font>

1121
01:02:50,842 --> 01:02:53,542
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be a lot different from when you were dating.</font>

1122
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:58,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Tae Yang would do well,</font>

1123
01:02:58,972 --> 01:02:59,972
<font color=#FFFF00>but still,</font>

1124
01:03:01,142 --> 01:03:04,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish you be considerate to each other...</font>

1125
01:03:04,802 --> 01:03:05,872
<font color=#FFFF00>and live happily.</font>

1126
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:07,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

1127
01:03:11,202 --> 01:03:12,202
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1128
01:03:15,302 --> 01:03:16,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure...</font>

1129
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,202
<font color=#FFFF00>you live happily.</font>

1130
01:03:37,072 --> 01:03:38,072
<font color=#FFFF00>The groom...</font>

1131
01:03:38,302 --> 01:03:42,802
<font color=#FFFF00>enters.</font>

1132
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:46,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone,</font>

1133
01:03:46,742 --> 01:03:49,342
<font color=#FFFF00>get out of the way!</font>

1134
01:03:50,502 --> 01:03:52,072
<font color=#FFFF00>He's all smiling.</font>

1135
01:03:52,072 --> 01:03:54,272
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of the way! - He looks so happy.</font>

1136
01:03:54,272 --> 01:03:56,142
<font color=#FFFF00>You did it.</font>

1137
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:59,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone,</font>

1138
01:03:59,742 --> 01:04:02,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- get out of the way! - Get out of the way!</font>

1139
01:04:19,172 --> 01:04:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's nice. - Do you think so?</font>

1140
01:04:21,342 --> 01:04:24,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we hold a wedding again in a traditional way?</font>

1141
01:04:24,802 --> 01:04:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure?</font>

1142
01:04:26,202 --> 01:04:28,302
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm kidding. - You're silly.</font>

1143
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:36,172
<font color=#FFFF00>The bride enters.</font>

1144
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,802
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of the way! - Get out of the way!</font>

1145
01:04:48,002 --> 01:04:50,102
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of the way! - Get out of the way!</font>

1146
01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:52,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone,</font>

1147
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,372
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of the way! - How are you?</font>

1148
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:56,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so beautiful.</font>

1149
01:05:01,642 --> 01:05:03,302
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you?</font>

1150
01:05:03,302 --> 01:05:04,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's the bride.</font>

1151
01:05:05,442 --> 01:05:07,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations. - Thank you.</font>

1152
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:11,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Yun, thank you.</font>

1153
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:14,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang.</font>

1154
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:17,442
<font color=#FFFF00>She looks happy.</font>

1155
01:05:18,802 --> 01:05:19,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

1156
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:24,102
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of the way! - Get out of the way!</font>

1157
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,872
<font color=#FFFF00>(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

1158
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I'm dreaming.</font>

1159
01:06:42,572 --> 01:06:44,042
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels surreal.</font>

1160
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,372
<font color=#FFFF00>If only we didn't become bankrupt,</font>

1161
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,702
<font color=#FFFF00>we wouldn't let her get married like this.</font>

1162
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:50,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil, are you all right? Why are you eating like that?</font>

1163
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:52,772
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you sick? - You kicked out my family.</font>

1164
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:55,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You should live well by yourself. What's wrong with you?</font>

1165
01:06:55,172 --> 01:06:58,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's forget about him. You're sick because of Dong Jin.</font>
