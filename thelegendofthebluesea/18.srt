00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,880
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Episode 18</i></font>

2
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,380
<font color=#FFFF00>If I were to be born again, I'd like to be</font>

3
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,690
<font color=#FFFF00>my wife's husband and my son's father.</font>

4
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,780
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I wish for. It's probably my greed.</font>

5
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry, Joon Jae. I love you, my son.</font>

6
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

7
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

8
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this 119? We have an emergency patient here.</font>

9
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Any recent medications?</font>

10
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure. He recently got an emergency surgery due to cerebral hemorrhage.</font>

11
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,360
<font color=#FFFF00>He was also scheduled to receive a cataract surgery, so he was probably taking medications related to that.</font>

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,760
<font color=#FFFF00>There are no other injuries, and looking at the spot coloring, there was no reaction to toxic chemicals.</font>

13
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Seeing that his lips are blue, it seems to be myocardial infarction, but we'll have more details after further examination.</font>

14
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is your mother?</font>

15
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,410
<font color=#FFFF00>She is out. She told me over the phone that she had an appointment about 2 hours ago.</font>

16
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,710
<font color=#FFFF00>- So she doesn't know that your father passed away yet?<br>- That's right.</font>

17
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't had a chance to tell her yet.</font>

18
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,610
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought she would be in too much shock when she finds out.</font>

19
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I see.</font>

20
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, let's move him to the hospital that has his medical records. Would you agree to it?</font>

21
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

22
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, Father!</font>

23
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Father! What do we do now!</font>

24
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,080
<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

25
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,770
<font color=#FFFF00>No, wait! Wait! Father!</font>

26
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,700
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not time yet, Father!</font>

27
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!</font>

28
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</font>

29
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,950
<font color=#FFFF00>After the postmortem examination, a vidimus will be issued for a funeral. You will need to prepare for the funeral.</font>

30
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Alright.</font>

31
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,820
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do that.</font>

32
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Chi Hyeon.</font>

33
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here. Come here, you bastard!</font>

34
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,900
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Who are you?</font>

35
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of you, my father... Because of you and that woman!</font>

36
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't leave you alone! I'll kill you. I'll kill both of you!!</font>

37
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this guy crazy?! Why are you doing this?</font>

38
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off!</font>

39
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,340
<font color=#FFFF00>You murderers! You guys killed my father!</font>

40
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you? I asked who are you?</font>

41
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,360
<font color=#FFFF00>I am... I am Heo Il Joong's son!</font>

42
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his son...</font>

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,830
<font color=#FFFF00>He is right. He is my younger brother.</font>

44
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:39,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Younger brother? I am your younger brother? Who are you?! Who are you, bastard!</font>

45
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,710
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who do you think you are?<br>- Let go! Do you want to get arrested?</font>

46
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,260
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do something about it here! Hey! <br>- Who do you think you are? Let go of me!</font>

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,560
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hold him, hold him, hold him. <br>- Let go!</font>

48
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Not touch him, jerks!</font>

49
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off. Don't touch him.</font>

50
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Joon Jae. Get a hold of yourself now.</font>

51
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,790
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. Come to your senses.</font>

52
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

53
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Father has passed away.</font>

54
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have stopped it,</font>

55
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,550
<font color=#FFFF00>but I couldn't.</font>

56
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,090
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you need to come to your senses, punk. You need to find everything out.</font>

57
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Why your father became like that... You need to find out.</font>

58
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your father for now. I'll take care of things here. Okay?</font>

59
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Officer Cha!</font>

60
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,790
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

61
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,580
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to Heo Joon Jae? I'm so worried that I can't even sleep.</font>

62
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Since Officer Hong went there, I'm sure he will let us know.</font>

63
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,900
<font color=#FFFF00>But my Cheong, there's something I'm curious about. Can I ask you about something?</font>

64
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,370
<font color=#FFFF00>You said it earlier.</font>

65
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,660
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Ma Dae Young. It's Ma Dae Young, since he can't remember anything right now.</i></font>

66
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,190
<font color=#FFFF00><i>What can he not remember?</i></font>

67
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,190
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Who he is, what he has done so far...</i></font>

68
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Ma Dae Young really lose all his memory?</font>

69
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,830
<font color=#FFFF00>How would you know that?</font>

70
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Could it be that our Cheong made Ma Dae Young like that?</font>

71
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you asking something like that?</font>

72
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I never thought I knew you so well,</font>

73
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:49,080
<font color=#FFFF00>but these days, I really am not sure who you are and what kind of ability you possess.</font>

74
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

75
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

76
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,790
<font color=#FFFF00>your friend.</font>

77
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, friend.</font>

78
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,860
<font color=#FFFF00>But my job is to make someone believe I'm his friend and then back stab him.</font>

79
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:19,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Although I don't like that you are that kind of person, for me, once I become a friend, that's all. Whether you back stab or not is your choice.</font>

80
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Once I get back stabbed, I will think about what to do with you.</font>

81
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Until then, you are my friend.</font>

82
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,410
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why aren't you guys answering the call?<br>- You scared me. What's going on?</font>

83
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you erase me?</font>

84
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,410
<font color=#FFFF00>The memory of my father.</font>

85
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Joon Jae.</font>

86
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,420
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do it, can't you?</font>

87
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you make me like that?</font>

88
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,810
<font color=#FFFF00>All the good memories</font>

89
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,460
<font color=#FFFF00>hurt because they were good.</font>

90
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Bad memories</font>

91
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,430
<font color=#FFFF00>hurt because they are bad.</font>

92
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,660
<font color=#FFFF00>All my memories of my father</font>

93
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,830
<font color=#FFFF00>hurt so much.</font>

94
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,550
<font color=#FFFF00>I still can't erase them.</font>

95
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,490
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how much it hurts, you loved your father.</font>

96
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,200
<font color=#FFFF00>It is said that you have hold on to the memory of love even if it hurts.</font>

97
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,510
<font color=#FFFF00>If I had gotten there just a little sooner,</font>

98
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I could have saved father.</font>

99
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,060
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

100
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,820
<font color=#FFFF00>If I hated him just a little less,</font>

101
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I could have saved my father.</font>

102
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,800
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

103
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Just a little...</font>

104
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,880
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not so.</font>

105
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,400
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not your fault.</font>

106
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,100
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not because of you.</font>

107
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have received</font>

108
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,980
<font color=#FFFF00>his last phone call.</font>

109
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have answered it.</font>

110
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:57,000
<font color=#FFFF00>That it's okay... that I forgave everything...</font>

111
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,890
<font color=#FFFF00>That I love him, too...</font>

112
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have said it.</font>

113
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't say those words.</font>

114
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too busy hating him,</font>

115
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't say those words.</font>

116
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Just one day... No...</font>

117
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,740
<font color=#FFFF00>just one hour... If I could have just one minute.</font>

118
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to talk to my father.</font>

119
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I can't do that.</font>

120
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do it anymore.</font>

121
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,080
<font color=#FFFF00>Some words are said without talking.</font>

122
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sure he knew it all.</font>

123
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,240
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The Legend of the Blue Sea</i></font>

124
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,620
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Mortuary</i></font>

125
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

126
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here, honey?</font>

127
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you?</font>

128
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,430
<font color=#FFFF00>This is not possible. He told me to come back home after my appointment.</font>

129
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,980
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me to get some fresh air.</font>

130
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You said, "See you later."</font>

131
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have gone out.</font>

132
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

133
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't... If you leave like this, how am I supposed to live?</font>

134
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,100
<font color=#FFFF00>No! This is unthinkable!</font>

135
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,480
<font color=#FFFF00>It can't be possible.</font>

136
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,480
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you, all by yourself...</font>

137
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,950
<font color=#FFFF00>- How can you leave me alone like this?!<br>- Please calm your mother down.</font>

138
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- It will be hard to go in the mortuary like this.<br>- No, Honey! No! You can't!</font>

139
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

140
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,910
<font color=#FFFF00>-Mother!<br>- It looks like she fainted from shock. Let's move her to the ER.</font>

141
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow! It's a shame to watch it by myself.</font>

142
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,720
<font color=#FFFF00>She really has great talent. She should've been an actress.</font>

143
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,260
<font color=#FFFF00>How did your father become like that all of a sudden?</font>

144
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,190
<font color=#FFFF00>They are still examining the body.</font>

145
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,930
<font color=#FFFF00>We will know the result tomorrow morning.</font>

146
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,280
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I told him to stop drinking too much. And smoking, too.</font>

147
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,470
<font color=#FFFF00>He just didn't listen.</font>

148
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,290
<font color=#FFFF00>As one gets older,</font>

149
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:41,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I hear you forget recent memories and only remember old memories. That's how I am right now.</font>

150
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Old days seem like they were yesterday.</font>

151
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Your father didn't seem to be that way though.</font>

152
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you meet Father?</font>

153
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. About a month ago, I saw him in this hospital accidentally.</font>

154
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,530
<font color=#FFFF00>He pretended not to know me.</font>

155
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though we locked eyes, he just passed me.</font>

156
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,950
<font color=#FFFF00>His gaze seemed to be of someone who really forgot it all.</font>

157
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Your father is such a harsh person.</font>

158
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,310
<font color=#FFFF00><i>If I were to be born again,</i></font>

159
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,870
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I would like to be</i></font>

160
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:36,260
<font color=#FFFF00><i>my wife's husband and my son's father.</i></font>

161
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,190
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That's what I wish for.</i></font>

162
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,730
<font color=#FFFF00><i>It's probably my greed.</i></font>

163
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Father had severe corneal damage that he could hardly see.</font>

164
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,600
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

165
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,220
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't pretend not to see you.</font>

166
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,310
<font color=#FFFF00>He couldn't see you.</font>

167
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Attorney Lee.</font>

168
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Please submit his death notification tomorrow.</font>

169
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I will send you the certificate and other necessary documentation.</font>

170
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, work on transferring inheritance.</font>

171
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,850
<font color=#FFFF00>How long will it take?</font>

172
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,300
<font color=#FFFF00><i>It will take about a week.</i></font>

173
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,950
<font color=#FFFF00>That's too long. Finish it as soon as possible.</font>

174
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom is fine now.</font>

175
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't take medication, so you don't need to get the prescription.</font>

176
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,610
<font color=#FFFF00>It was you, wasn't it?</font>

177
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,980
<font color=#FFFF00>What is?</font>

178
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, you have to tell me.</font>

179
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to know so I can help.</font>

180
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,870
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

181
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,790
<font color=#FFFF00>You are correct.</font>

182
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,910
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

183
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:31,210
<font color=#FFFF00>just in case, you don't know anything.</font>

184
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,300
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Emergency Medical Center</i></font>

185
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo Nam Doo?</font>

186
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,120
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Attention!</i></font>

187
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,260
<font color=#FFFF00>A new warrior?</font>

188
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,880
<font color=#FFFF00>I am called Park Moo.</font>

189
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard your skills are excellent.</font>

190
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Please assist my son well.</font>

191
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,650
<font color=#FFFF00>If one posses a lot, a lot of people will be after him.</font>

192
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:49,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, but how do you know my name?</font>

193
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we talk a little?</font>

194
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,500
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that Joon Jae is doing some strange work.</font>

195
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I was worried and looked into it a bit.</font>

196
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I see.</font>

197
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,390
<font color=#FFFF00>While I was doing it, I found out about you. You are a bit different from Joon Jae.</font>

198
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae scamed against hidden dirty money</font>

199
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,700
<font color=#FFFF00>or illegal money that the victims wouldn't be able to report the scam.</font>

200
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,800
<font color=#FFFF00>But you didn't care about the source, Mr. Jo Nam Doo.</font>

201
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,130
<font color=#FFFF00>In other words,</font>

202
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,640
<font color=#FFFF00>- you commit all kinds of crime?<br>- Yes.</font>

203
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,820
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't discriminate.</font>

204
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:37,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I eat all kinds of things and I do all kinds of work. That's how it is.</font>

205
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,060
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

206
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,760
<font color=#FFFF00>As early as tomorrow,<br> <i>(using informal tone)</i></font>

207
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,800
<font color=#FFFF00>no, even today, I can put you in jail. That's what I'm saying.</font>

208
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,680
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do? <i>(informal speech form)</i></font>

209
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,080
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you listen to me or rot in jail for a few years?</font>

210
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you speaking informally? <i>(using formal speech)</i></font>

211
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Please treat me kindly.</font>

212
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,070
<font color=#FFFF00>I am always on the side of the one with a lot of money.</font>

213
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:20,220
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like you will inherit all your father's assets, Hyungnim.</font>

214
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,610
<font color=#FFFF00>If that's the case, there is no need to threaten me so harshly like this.</font>

215
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I have more than enough reason to side with you.</font>

216
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,230
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it that you want?</font>

217
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,780
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm going to get rid of Joon Jae.<br>- To where?</font>

218
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Anywhere fine. So he won't be anywhere.</font>

219
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, actually,</font>

220
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,290
<font color=#FFFF00>there is something special that I really want.</font>

221
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,540
<font color=#FFFF00>If Joon Jae disappears, I think it will be easier for me, too.</font>

222
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, that's fine.</font>

223
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,450
<font color=#FFFF00>I was hesitating a bit because I felt a bit close to him, but sure, let's do it.</font>

224
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,960
<font color=#FFFF00>This relation was bound to end sooner or later.</font>

225
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,300
<font color=#FFFF00>The cause of death is</font>

226
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,860
<font color=#FFFF00>sudden death caused by acute heart failure.</font>

227
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Sudden death? Not by poisoning?</font>

228
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,750
<font color=#FFFF00>If his death were caused by toxic poison, his lips would have turned dark brown.</font>

229
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,710
<font color=#FFFF00>But his lips were bluish.</font>

230
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,370
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a typical symptom of cardiac arrest.</font>

231
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,620
<font color=#FFFF00>In addition, if it was due to toxic chemicals, his death spots should have been black, but it wasn't like that.</font>

232
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Based on his medical records, I believe it was a natural death caused by acute heart failure.</font>

233
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,980
<font color=#FFFF00>If it was a strong poison like cyanide, it could've been like that.</font>

234
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,110
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's my understanding that the symptoms are different if the poison was extracted from natural substance, like helmet flowers.</font>

235
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,070
<font color=#FFFF00>On the surface, the symptom is said to be very similar to that of heart failure.</font>

236
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,880
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to do the autopsy.</font>

237
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,070
<font color=#FFFF00>That way, we can reveal the real cause of death,</font>

238
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,140
<font color=#FFFF00>and find the cause of corneal damage.</font>

239
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,840
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to kill your father twice?</font>

240
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

241
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there something that you don't want to be found out?</font>

242
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,210
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what I'm saying. Joon Jae, for sending your father</font>

243
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,970
<font color=#FFFF00>alone like that makes me crazy.</font>

244
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,260
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want him to be hacked to pieces with a knife again.</font>

245
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,420
<font color=#FFFF00>What in the world do you want to find out that you want an autopsy?</font>

246
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,980
<font color=#FFFF00>- The evidence that you killed my father.<br>- Hey!</font>

247
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do it, Chi Hyeon.</font>

248
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,170
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been 10 years already, Joon Jae.</font>

249
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Over 10 years, your father missed you so much,</font>

250
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,250
<font color=#FFFF00>but you never visited home.</font>

251
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I am curious as to why you are being like this all of a sudden.</font>

252
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because of money?</font>

253
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,810
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's for money, I'll give it all to you. So,</font>

254
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,070
<font color=#FFFF00>let's just send him peacefully. He is your father, after all.</font>

255
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not be so cruel like that.</font>

256
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,070
<font color=#FFFF00>With such perfect acting that would even fool yourself,</font>

257
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,130
<font color=#FFFF00>you may have bewitched many people and blinded my father's eyes,</font>

258
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,170
<font color=#FFFF00>that won't work anymore.</font>

259
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I am Heo Il Joong's only biological son. The helmet flowers that were found in that house,</font>

260
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,510
<font color=#FFFF00>and micro-needles and a large amount of anticholinergic that belong to Kang Seo Hee's,</font>

261
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,470
<font color=#FFFF00>all those are evidence that could have been used for murder, so I am requesting an autopsy.</font>

262
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,080
<font color=#FFFF00>I am the oldest son of this household.</font>

263
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I am also the only son that father acknowledged.</font>

264
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Younger brother ran away from home 10 years ago and cut off the relationship with our father.</font>

265
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of the inheritance issue, there was a big conflict with father recently.</font>

266
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I and my mother do not want an autopsy.</font>

267
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Father will agree with that.</font>

268
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,410
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is a search and seizure warrant.<br>- Search the place!</font>

269
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, isn't it a bit too early for funeral clothes?</font>

270
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Funeral will start soon.</font>

271
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,060
<font color=#FFFF00>If we do autopsy, you won't be able to do funeral.</font>

272
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- I guess you are confident.<br>- Think whatever you want to think.</font>

273
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,150
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what I say, you won't believe me anyway.</font>

274
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know Kang Ji Hyeon by any chance?</font>

275
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,450
<font color=#FFFF00>And, from now on,</font>

276
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>if there are anything else you'd like to ask, please go through my lawyer.</font>

277
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, lawyer...</font>

278
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,120
<font color=#FFFF00>I suppose you do have something to say through your lawyer.</font>

279
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,710
<font color=#FFFF00>If course you would. It's your twin sister's name.</font>

280
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,110
<font color=#FFFF00>It was really hard to obtain this picture of your childhood.</font>

281
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,840
<font color=#FFFF00>You two really look alike.</font>

282
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,870
<font color=#FFFF00>So it's fraternal, right?</font>

283
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what you are trying to say.</font>

284
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is your sister now?</font>

285
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Or is that you?</font>

286
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going crazy.</font>

287
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, didn't anything come up?</font>

288
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,500
<font color=#FFFF00>As you can see.</font>

289
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Sunbae, do you think you were wrong this time?</font>

290
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,510
<font color=#FFFF00>No. It couldn't have escaped from this house.</font>

291
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,180
<font color=#FFFF00>There must be something in this house.</font>

292
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, today is not red. It's black.</font>

293
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

294
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairman Heo... passed away.</font>

295
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,770
<font color=#FFFF00>What? How?</font>

296
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,450
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know, either. I just heard about it now.</font>

297
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, how is it turning now?</font>

298
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,010
<font color=#FFFF00>If he passes away so suddenly, what will happen to our fate?</font>

299
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,980
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard CEO Heo left all his assets to the adopted son and Kang Seo Hee.</font>

300
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,320
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I heard.</font>

301
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,310
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, even though he had notarized his will,</font>

302
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought he would give it to his biological son.</font>

303
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,780
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. You could just change your will anyway.</font>

304
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,640
<font color=#FFFF00>But if he passes away so suddenly like this,</font>

305
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,190
<font color=#FFFF00>then they can't do anything about it.</font>

306
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Then did we line up on the wrong side?</font>

307
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,760
<font color=#FFFF00>It's beyond just lining up on the wrong side.</font>

308
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Ugh! To think what I did to that woman, Kang Seo Hee...</font>

309
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my god! I will be put to death by dismemberment!</font>

310
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you change the line even at this point?</font>

311
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,470
<font color=#FFFF00>How can a person be like that? As a person, it's acceptable to change the side once.</font>

312
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,310
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you change it twice, that is just wrong as a person.</font>

313
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,040
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't do that!<br>- What what do we do?</font>

314
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,220
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know it, either!</font>

315
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, how can you come here?</font>

316
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,240
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think? I'm getting people's attention, and it will be awkward for you.</font>

317
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,500
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Joon Jae's father,</i></font>

318
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,010
<font color=#FFFF00><i>there were many reasons why I couldn't forgive you.</i></font>

319
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:42,470
<font color=#FFFF00><i>But seeing the end of you is so sad.</i></font>

320
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,290
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Can you see me now?</i></font>

321
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,130
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Watch me well. I need to say farewell.</i></font>

322
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Like mother, like son.</font>

323
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Your son never came to visit his father for over 10 years.</font>

324
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that he is dead, there is no better son than him.</font>

325
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,140
<font color=#FFFF00>It must all be because of money.</font>

326
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,030
<font color=#FFFF00>The petty reason you came here</font>

327
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,770
<font color=#FFFF00>is trying to find some crumbs to collect, isn't it?</font>

328
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,920
<font color=#FFFF00>If you just stayed still, I would have given you something.</font>

329
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,490
<font color=#FFFF00>If you come out so loudly like this,</font>

330
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,970
<font color=#FFFF00>would I have heart to give you even a penny? Ouch!</font>

331
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

332
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,890
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have you gone crazy?! <br>- The ones who crawled in to collect some crumbs are you and your son.</font>

333
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:53,680
<font color=#FFFF00>If you did that, you should have been satisfied by leeching off of others.</font>

334
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Now a thief wants to act like an owner?</font>

335
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,000
<font color=#FFFF00>You are too greedy.</font>

336
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
<font color=#FFFF00>What? A thief?</font>

337
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,060
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is this?<br> - Are you trying to hit her? I don't think you are in the position to hit her.</font>

338
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,840
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you? Who are you to intervene?</font>

339
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,660
<font color=#FFFF00>You watch what you say.</font>

340
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, is she someone you know? No wonder!</font>

341
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go! Won't you let go?</font>

342
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,130
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing now?</font>

343
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,760
<font color=#FFFF00>What I'm trying to do is... There's something I'm curious about.</font>

344
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,770
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

345
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,730
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Don't forget to take your medicine.</i></font>

346
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,630
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong, Cheong?</font>

347
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,890
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just do?</font>

348
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I could have done everything, but I didn't do anything.</font>

349
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you shouldn't forget all the wrong that you did.</font>

350
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,550
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you should remember them till the end.</font>

351
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,640
<font color=#FFFF00>You should remember all the things that you coveted,</font>

352
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,730
<font color=#FFFF00>so you will be more tormented for not obtaining them.</font>

353
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go now.</font>

354
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,900
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get me some more side dishes.<br>- I'm not a worker here.</font>

355
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

356
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Omo, Madam.</font>

357
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,050
<font color=#FFFF00>- Madam, you must be so sad.<br>- Omo, you've lost weight.</font>

358
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,050
<font color=#FFFF00>- Despite all that Madam, you're so beautiful.<br>- Oh, I'm worried, will you be alright?</font>

359
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, how could anyone have so few principles.</font>

360
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,240
<font color=#FFFF00>They're lucky.</font>

361
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:11,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Ugh, why do I have to be so honest when it comes to my own principles?! I'm insane.</font>

362
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Yu Ran Unnie? We're the odd ones out at this point.</font>

363
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I do something too?</font>

364
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,770
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did they find evidences?<br>- Not yet.</font>

365
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,720
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're not gonna go to the funeral hall?<br>- Yeah.</font>

366
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,540
<font color=#FFFF00>You should just go.</font>

367
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,830
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I? I still haven't figured out how he passed away.</font>

368
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to do that?</font>

369
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,060
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

370
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,710
<font color=#FFFF00>- The autopsy.<br>- What?!</font>

371
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,960
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all in the past. Whatever truth we find now</font>

372
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
<font color=#FFFF00>won't make your deceased father come back to life.</font>

373
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,440
<font color=#FFFF00>We're just poking at them at this point. And besides that,</font>

374
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,600
<font color=#FFFF00>you should be sweet talking them, working it out--making sure that you'll inherit something at least.</font>

375
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if he <i>is</i> a stranger to you, you don't say things like that!</font>

376
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I said anything I shouldn't have.</font>

377
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about it.</font>

378
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Joon Jae.</font>

379
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I saw something.</font>

380
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:59,530
<font color=#FFFF00>You came to stand next to me--only to get caught up in a mess like this, having to see bad things you don't need to see.</font>

381
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,400
<font color=#FFFF00>The fact that all those things become your memories, it upsets me.</font>

382
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though I'm happy that I can protect you with what I have?</font>

383
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,760
<font color=#FFFF00>You protect <i>me</i>?</font>

384
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Why, Heo Joon Jae? You think I can't?</font>

385
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,340
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true, I came up to the land without knowing anything, which made other people treat me like an idiot.</font>

386
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,980
<font color=#FFFF00>- But unlike what you see, I was totally popular in the sea.<br>- Is that so?</font>

387
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:27,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course! Unlike what you see, I'm a mermaid of an endangered species.</font>

388
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Sigh, these days you human beings with your submarines and skin scuba-whatever, you call it that and barge into the underwater</font>

389
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,790
<font color=#FFFF00>do you realize how hard it is for mermaids and mermen to stay hidden and survive?</font>

390
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:42,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Then sharks come whenever they want, saying "We'll bite and kill you"--Our lives are hard too.</font>

391
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,210
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you do when a shark comes?</font>

392
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I can fight a shark and <i>still</i> win.</font>

393
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:51,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, really? My girlfriend's the best!</font>

394
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,650
<font color=#FFFF00>You're smiling. From now on, I'll keep making you smile.</font>

395
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,100
<font color=#FFFF00>"I'll protect you", "I'll make you smile". These are all things that the guy's supposed to say!</font>

396
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll protect you. I'll make you smile.</font>

397
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Dummy, saying all the things <i>I'm </i>supposed to say.</font>

398
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,780
<font color=#FFFF00>What should we do? We've made no progress.</font>

399
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,820
<font color=#FFFF00>It's here.</font>

400
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,010
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where are you going?<br>- The basement?</font>

401
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I looked over there already.</font>

402
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,630
<font color=#FFFF00>She made a place like this. This never existed.</font>

403
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Forensics and I looked over this place.</font>

404
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,590
<font color=#FFFF00>It's there.</font>

405
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,900
<font color=#FFFF00>- These are wolfsbane flowers.<br>- Don't touch those! Don't touch anything.</font>

406
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether it's a fingerprint or anything else, it'll all come out.</font>

407
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,790
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that? Isn't that a mermaid?</font>

408
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma Dae Young. Ma Dae Young was here.</font>

409
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,310
<font color=#FFFF00>And Kang Seo Hee was Kang Ji Hyun.</font>

410
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae, thank goodness you came. You should be here with your older brother as chief mourner.</font>

411
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I should. <i>After</i> I see you put in jail.</font>

412
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,990
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

413
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:01,210
<font color=#FFFF00>From this moment, the unnatural death case of the deceased, Heo Il Joong, has been turned into a murder case.</font>

414
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,370
<font color=#FFFF00>The deceased will be immediately transferred to the National Forensic Service for an autopsy.

415
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,490
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say? With whose permission?</font>

416
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:17,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Seo Hee, no, Kang Ji Hyeon, I'm arresting you without a warrant as a murder suspect.</font>

417
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:25,930
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the right to remain silent and you have the right to the attorney you like so much so do as you wish.</font>

418
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have evidence? Do you have a warrant?!</font>

419
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Because there was so much evidence your mother left at home, we were able to easily collect it.</font>

420
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,040
<font color=#FFFF00>And that's why we're arresting her without warrant.</font>

421
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:54,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you trying to say that I killed my husband right now?</font>

422
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You should frame the right person.</font>

423
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,210
<font color=#FFFF00>If my husband heard he'd be so upset.</font>

424
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:06,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut up! Don't speak my father's name so easily with that mouth.</font>

425
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,710
<font color=#FFFF00>His words have weight.</font>

426
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,580
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Why are you putting these kinds of things on me?!</font>

427
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Take them off! Can't you take them off? Take them off!</font>

428
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,850
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys are making a mistake with me.</font>

429
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,970
<font color=#FFFF00>If you do this to an innocent person do you think you'll be safe?!</font>

430
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Take them off!</font>

431
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Chi Hyeon! Contact the lawyer!</font>

432
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,490
<font color=#FFFF00>- Chi Hyeon! Call the lawyer, hurry!<br> - Rascal</font>

433
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Chi Hyeon.</font>

434
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Noona.</font>

435
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:09,040
<font color=#FFFF00>But did something happen? Why is the atmosphere like this here?</font>

436
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,970
<font color=#FFFF00>How can such a thing like this happen? Joon Jae must be so heartbroken.</font>

437
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:30,340
<font color=#FFFF00>How long has it been since he's met his mother that this kind of thing should happen?</font>

438
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's your car?</font>

439
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,080
<font color=#FFFF00>I took the bus.</font>

440
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I drop you off?</font>

441
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:46,310
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay. Well, do you want to? It is late.</font>

442
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:51,160
<font color=#FFFF00>But you can't have other thoughts, okay? It'll be burdensome to me then.</font>

443
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, isn't this person insanely hot?</font>

444
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, look. He's totally good-looking.</font>

445
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,380
<font color=#FFFF00>They're so loud.</font>

446
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,780
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i> Why am I looking at her?</i>♬</font>

447
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,470
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i>(Could it be love?)</i>♬</font>

448
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:28,850
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i> Why do I smile when I see her?</i>♬</font>

449
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,940
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i> (Could it be love?)</i>♬</font>

450
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,060
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i>It must be a dream</i> ♬</font>

451
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,180
<font color=#FFFF00>What's he doing?</font>

452
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,110
<font color=#FFFF00>♬ <i>It must be a dream</i> ♬</font>

453
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:46,920
<font color=#FFFF00>He's won the lotto. He'd be so excited to know that he's fallen asleep on my shoulder.</font>

454
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:53,750
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i>Why am I like this? Just why am I? </i>♬</font>

455
00:44:53,770 --> 00:45:00,660
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he be prettier than a girl?</font>

456
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, did you see this?</font>

457
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,210
<font color=#FFFF00>This is daebak (awesome)!</font>

458
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh no, I have to get off here.</font>

459
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,470
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i>Wake me up, oh me.</i>♬</font>

460
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,910
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i>What kind of magic are you using on me?</i>♬</font>

461
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:23,750
<font color=#FFFF00>♬<i>How are you doing this to me?</i>♬</font>

462
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:33,730
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Subtitles brought to you by The Blue Sea @ Viki</i></font>

463
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Sleep here.</font>

464
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,500
<font color=#FFFF00>But Ma Dae Young may have lost his memory but he remembers the mermaid.</font>

465
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, right.</font>

466
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:04,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma Dae Young seems to be better than Dam Ryeong sometimes when it comes to his thinking of the mermaid.</font>

467
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:13,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Hwa seems to speak so prettily. Her smile is pretty and her actions are so demure.</font>

468
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if just because the face is alike if the person could be the same?</font>

469
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you like that, really?</font>

470
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:33,060
<font color=#FFFF00>But would everything really only be repeating from the past life in the same way?</font>

471
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

472
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Truthfully, when I was erasing Ma Dae Young's memory I saw another person's face.</font>

473
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Who?</font>

474
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,460
<font color=#FFFF00>The spear we were hit with when we died wasn't one that Ma Dae Young threw.</font>

475
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,710
<font color=#FFFF00>What does that mean?</font>

476
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,090
<font color=#FFFF00>It was one that someone else threw. I saw that person's face.</font>

477
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

478
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,370
<font color=#FFFF00>A person we know.</font>

479
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Looking at it, they only have circumstantial evidence. They don't have direct evidence.</font>

480
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,190
<font color=#FFFF00>The poison tonic,</font>

481
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,390
<font color=#FFFF00>the evidence that you gave it to the Chairman,</font>

482
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:29,770
<font color=#FFFF00>They're going to interrogate you with leading questions. Only listen. Keep your answers short.</font>

483
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,080
<font color=#FFFF00>If they ask you unfavorable questions, "I don't remember,"</font>

484
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,170
<font color=#FFFF00>"My head hurts, I have a chronic disease,"</font>

485
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,220
<font color=#FFFF00>You can use your right to remain silent.</font>

486
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Because they arrest you emergently without a warrant</font>

487
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,110
<font color=#FFFF00>they can only hold you for 48 hours.</font>

488
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:53,040
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hurry up and tell us. If you don't speak it will just go over as evidence.</i></font>

489
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,620
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I don't know.</i></font>

490
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Look here. You had this cup, and these 10 plates...</font>

491
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

492
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you receive a prescription for an anticholinergic?</font>

493
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,450
<font color=#FFFF00>My head hurts. <br>No.</font>

494
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Using water infused with wolfsbane-!</font>

495
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

496
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,030
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a panic disorder...</font>

497
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you that I don't remember and I don't know anything!</font>

498
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:32,710
<font color=#FFFF00>She's totally decided to hold out on the "I have no recollection." If this much evidence, I thought she'd confess.</font>

499
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:41,550
<font color=#FFFF00>If she acknowledges it she becomes disqualified as a successor and all that money disappears. She probably would desperately endure it.</font>

500
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,150
<font color=#FFFF00>If she doesn't confess it crosses over into an investigation without detention, right?</font>

501
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,970
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems like he's leaving after meeting with the Detective.</font>

502
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother will be released about 6pm today, right?</font>

503
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:09,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, how would tonight be?</font>

504
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think they'd stay like this forever. We strike first.</font>

505
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel a bit urgent too.</font>

506
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:32,380
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Police: We Serve You with Devotion</i></font>

507
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,080
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh!</font>

508
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,880
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

509
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,700
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Joon Jae Hyung.</font>

510
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,840
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Heo Joon Jae?</font>

511
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Jo Nam Doo crazy? Why is he like that?</font>

512
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't I go by myself? What if it's dangerous?</font>

513
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Ho, there's something you don't know.</font>

514
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,920
<font color=#FFFF00>If we had an actual fight, you wouldn't even be able to save your bones.</font>

515
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Just know that I'm way stronger than you and hurry up and step on the gas.</font>

516
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Tie him tighter.</font>

517
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:53,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey you bastard! How could you do this to me? How could you do this to me?!</font>

518
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,780
<font color=#FFFF00>You were the one who fell for a woman</font>

519
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,450
<font color=#FFFF00>and stopped working with me. You're the one who betrayed me!</font>

520
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to make a living too. I'm sorry about this.</font>

521
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Untie me. Untie me, you bastard!</font>

522
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, and this.</font>

523
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,550
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that?</font>

524
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:19,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Your suicide note. It will be discovered in your room tomorrow.</font>

525
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,070
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going to commit suicide from the guilt of having killed your father today.</font>

526
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,780
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

527
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do it.</font>

528
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do it.</font>

529
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,100
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the component that killed your father, Acrotine.</font>

530
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:48,760
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's fast 10 minutes, if it's late 30 minutes. You'll become comfortable (dead).</font>

531
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,060
<font color=#FFFF00>You crazy bastard.</font>

532
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:56,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you weren't able to receive any inheritance from father, that's enough for the murder motive.</font>

533
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:04,500
<font color=#FFFF00>And... since you know the layout of our house well, you concealed the evidence in the basement</font>

534
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Joon Jae.</font>

535
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,570
<font color=#FFFF00>It wouldn't be hard to come up with a story.</font>

536
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,820
<font color=#FFFF00>- Chi Hyeon. <br> - Yes, Mother.</font>

537
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you wait outside with that person?</font>

538
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'll leave you alone according to your wishes?</font>

539
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:45,400
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't what are you going to do?</font>

540
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Dead men tell no tales.</font>

541
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you father. He can't say anything.</font>

542
00:53:53,830 --> 00:54:00,020
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you be like that to Father?</font>

543
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,100
<font color=#FFFF00>When Father was so good to you!</font>

544
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,870
<font color=#FFFF00>And wasn't I good?! It was 17 years.</font>

545
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:15,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I spent 17 years, acting like the tongue in Heo Il Joong's mouth and I was very good.</font>

546
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:24,810
<font color=#FFFF00>But when it came time to bequeath his fortune he only looked for his blood.</font>

547
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you killed him?</font>

548
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I killed him.</font>

549
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,890
<font color=#FFFF00>As it was your father was dying.</font>

550
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:41,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Truthfully, that poison, he hadn't been ingesting it only for one or two days.</font>

551
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,850
<font color=#FFFF00>He was becoming addicted to it in very small amounts so he didn't know.</font>

552
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,510
<font color=#FFFF00>It would have been hard for him to pass a year</font>

553
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:07,170
<font color=#FFFF00>but with him saying he wanted to draw up a will</font>

554
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:12,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I just sent him a bit early.</font>

555
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:19,320
<font color=#FFFF00>You killed your previous husbands like that too, didn't you Kang Ji Yeon.</font>

556
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:28,800
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. But no one knew even after 20 years passed.</font>

557
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Perhaps, even after 20 years passes no one will probably know</font>

558
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:39,240
<font color=#FFFF00>that I killed you and your father.</font>

559
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Would that really be?</font>

560
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Who did it? I told you not to do that during working hours.</font>

561
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out!</font>

562
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,940
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

563
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,680
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?! Who are you?! Can't you let this go? Let go!</font>

564
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,360
<font color=#FFFF00>You! How dare you-</font>

565
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:36,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Look to see how many people put on such a show to make you confess to your crimes.</font>

566
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, this person has a panic disorder. Hurry up and arrest her and lock her up</font>

567
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,150
<font color=#FFFF00>so she can be alone.</font>

568
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:52,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!</font>

569
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:57,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! You, Heo Joon Jae! You're going to be in trouble!</font>

570
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:11,100
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hey, a job came in from Heo Chi Hyeon.</i></font>

571
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,910
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Do I look like a betrayer-type? Why does everyone (do this) to me?</i></font>

572
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:20,100
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Heo Chi Hyeon does see a person correctly.</i></font>

573
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,640
<font color=#FFFF00><i>So what did you say?</i></font>

574
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,580
<font color=#FFFF00><i>What do you mean, what did I say? Of course, I said I'd do it.</i></font>

575
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,390
<font color=#FFFF00><i>You human being I can't trust.</i></font>

576
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,400
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hey, it's like this. That side's a successor and you're a beggar.</i></font>

577
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,520
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hey, you know my principle, right? First, money. Second, even more money.</i></font>

578
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,400
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Then you should just take the money and do what they ask. What're you coming here to tell us this for?</i></font>

579
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,040
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Sadly, the third principle doesn't fit. </i></font>

580
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,180
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The third? What's that?</i></font>

581
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,440
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Manners.</i></font>

582
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,700
<font color=#FFFF00><i>What?</i></font>

583
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,930
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I keep manners. This jerk kept speaking casually to me, when he's even younger than I am. </i></font>

584
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,410
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I speak casually to you too.</i></font>

585
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:01,240
<font color=#FFFF00><i>You're the home owner. I have a respect for the home owner. Respect, admiration. </i></font>

586
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,190
<font color=#FFFF00><i>So, did you tell him you wouldn't do it?</i></font>

587
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,850
<font color=#FFFF00><i>No, I told him I'd do it.</i></font>

588
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,870
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Why?</i></font>

589
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,560
<font color=#FFFF00><i>We have to go hit him.</i></font>

590
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,310
<font color=#FFFF00><i>What?<br> - The back of his head.</i></font>

591
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:24,550
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[ We're being wire tapped nearby. I'll only speak to you through text messages. ] </i></font>

592
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,630
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Did any fingerprints come out yet?</i></font>

593
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,710
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Not yet.</i></font>

594
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,980
<font color=#FFFF00><i>You're not going to the funeral hall?</i></font>

595
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,910
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'm not going. <br> [ Act angry. ] </i></font>

596
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,000
<font color=#FFFF00><i>But you should still go.</i></font>

597
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,410
<font color=#FFFF00><i>How can I go when I still don't know how my father died yet.</i></font>

598
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,720
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[ No. Be a little angrier! ] </i></font>

599
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,100
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Do you have to do it?</i></font>

600
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,610
<font color=#FFFF00><i>- What? <br> - The autopsy.</i></font>

601
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:49,110
<font color=#FFFF00><i>No matter that it's someone else's business, is that something you should say?!</i></font>

602
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,950
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That's right. You're doing well. </i></font>

603
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get ready.</font>

604
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

605
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,510
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'll hit you in front of the car door.</i></font>

606
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Fall down, fall down.</font>

607
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Make it look realistic. Does it make sense that if you hit hit from the back that you'd drip blood from there?</font>

608
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,070
<font color=#FFFF00>It really hurt earlier.</font>

609
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,920
<font color=#FFFF00>What, it's not even a real steel pipe. Why are you making such a fuss about getting hit with it?</font>

610
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, is it a right or a left at this port?</font>

611
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Straight.</font>

612
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, I lost it because of you! Damn it.</font>

613
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:05,750
<font color=#FFFF00>You! You! Heo Joon Jae! Can't you let go?!</font>

614
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

615
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Chi Hyeon.</font>

616
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Chi Hyeon!</font>

617
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,310
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't!</font>

618
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:40,550
<font color=#FFFF00>- Work hard. <br> - You worked hard.</font>

619
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Hey!</font>

620
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Chi Heyon!</font>

621
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and get in.</font>

622
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Joon Jae!</font>

623
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw that person's face.</font>

624
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Heo Chi Hyeon.</font>
