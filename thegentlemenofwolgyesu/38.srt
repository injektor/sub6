<font color="yellow">Uncle's changed, hasn't he?</font>

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,690

<font color="yellow">you and the store.</font>

44
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,560
<font color="yellow">I thought for a long time how to say goodbye...</font>

45
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,860
<font color="yellow">in a way that would hurt the least.</font>

<font color="yellow">The best way...</font>

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,490
<font color="yellow">was for me to leave quietly.</font>

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,060
<font color="yellow">Over the past few months,</font>

49
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,430
<font color="yellow">I felt so happy that...</font>

50
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,860
<font color="yellow">I asked myself many times a day if I were dreaming.</font>

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,290
<font color="yellow">That's why it was so hard.</font>

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,490
<font color="yellow">The more I love you,</font>

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,860
<font color="yellow">the less there is I can do for you.</font>

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,560
<font color="yellow">That broke my heart.</font>

<font color="yellow">You may call me a coward,</font>

56
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,560
<font color="yellow">but when I think about the heartaches you'll have to endure...</font>

57
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,390
<font color="yellow">because of me, I don't think I can handle it.</font>

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,130
<font color="yellow">I was very happy...</font>

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,130
<font color="yellow">because of you.</font>

60
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,960
<font color="yellow">The fact that I experienced such great love...</font>

61
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,130
<font color="yellow">will give me the courage to go on and be happy.</font>

<font color="yellow">My son's future's at stake.</font>

88

91

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,430

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,430
<font color="yellow">Did Yun Shil come here?</font>

105
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,390
<font color="yellow">She snuck in a few days ago while I was out...</font>

106
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,030
<font color="yellow">and took all of her belongings and disappeared.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why do you ask anyway?</font>

108
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,460
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

109
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,890
<font color="yellow">- She left. - Where to?</font>

110
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,330

111
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,390
<font color="yellow">Are you putting on an act to get rid of me?</font>

112
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,590
<font color="yellow">He's half out of his wits, so I don't think he's lying.</font>

113
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,690
<font color="yellow">She must have gone because she knows Gi Pyo will be released.</font>

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,560
<font color="yellow">He'll throw a fit when he hears she's gone.</font>

115
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,190
<font color="yellow">What should I do about this?</font>

116
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,190
<font color="yellow">You should maintain the inventory and manage the clients...</font>

<font color="yellow">in the new year.</font>

118
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,830

119
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,530

122
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,390

123
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,360

130

131
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,860

<font color="yellow">Those punks wouldn't let me go.</font>

159
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,230
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm from Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

160
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,530
<font color="yellow">I came here once with Yun Shil.</font>

161
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,190
<font color="yellow">I remember you.</font>

162
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,330
<font color="yellow">Do you know of anywhere she might be...</font>

163
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,660
<font color="yellow">or anyone she might call?</font>

164
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,030
<font color="yellow">She disappeared and I'm trying to find her.</font>

165
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,730
<font color="yellow">I tried calling all the merchants who know her.</font>

166
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,460
<font color="yellow">None of them have talked to her recently.</font>

167
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,190
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

168
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,190
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

169
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,530
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

170
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,790
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

171
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,930
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to reach Hyo Won.</font>

172
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,890
<font color="yellow">I came by because I'm worried.</font>

173
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,690
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

174
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,660
<font color="yellow">- lock her up again? - No!</font>

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,290
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare imply I'm a criminal.</font>

176
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,030
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

177
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,960
<font color="yellow">Where is she right now?</font>

178
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,530
<font color="yellow">I raised her in such a way that any princess would envy her.</font>

179
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,030
<font color="yellow">And you came along and treated her...</font>

180
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,830
<font color="yellow">like an old piece of chewing gum.</font>

181
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,290
<font color="yellow">I find that insulting and upsetting.</font>

182
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,190
<font color="yellow">I never treated her like chewing gum.</font>

183
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,960
<font color="yellow">If she and your childhood friend were both drowning,</font>

184
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,930
<font color="yellow">you said you'd save your friend.</font>

185
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,960
<font color="yellow">I never said that.</font>

186
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
<font color="yellow">I said I'd think about it.</font>

187
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,390
<font color="yellow">That's the same thing!</font>

188
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,260
<font color="yellow">I was joking.</font>

189
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,730
<font color="yellow">Let me make something clear. In every conceivable way,</font>

190
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,830
<font color="yellow">my daughter is above you.</font>

191
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,160
<font color="yellow">Two people in love should be equals.</font>

192
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,590
<font color="yellow">No! What I say goes.</font>

193
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,030
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Ma'am. - I...</font>

194
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,730
<font color="yellow">sorted things out for you.</font>

195
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,390
<font color="yellow">Do not do anything to disrupt the peace and order.</font>

196
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,390
<font color="yellow">I will not allow or accept it if you keep leading Hyo Won on.</font>

197
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,960
<font color="yellow">I'm not leading her on.</font>

198
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,860
<font color="yellow">It's more like she drags me around.</font>

199
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

200
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,890
<font color="yellow">- I understand. - Another thing.</font>

201
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,560
<font color="yellow">The commercial you turned down.</font>

202
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,830
<font color="yellow">They'll shoot on another day. So you'll have to do it.</font>

203
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,630
<font color="yellow">They adjusted the date? How did that happen?</font>

204
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,590
<font color="yellow">That was nothing to me.</font>

205
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,560
<font color="yellow">You have the most talented manager in all of Korea.</font>

206
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,190
<font color="yellow">Do you know that?</font>

207
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,990
<font color="yellow">I do now.</font>

208
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll shoot the commercial.</font>

209
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,660
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Hyo Won, show yourself.</font>

210
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,730
<font color="yellow">Were you there all along?</font>

211
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,730
<font color="yellow">Mum told me to hide between the chairs...</font>

212
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,790
<font color="yellow">until she got you to promise.</font>

213
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,190
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

214
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,830
<font color="yellow">Not being able to see you...</font>

215
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,830
<font color="yellow">made my eyes sting and water.</font>

216
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,560
<font color="yellow">Not being able to talk to you...</font>

217
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
<font color="yellow">almost made my fingers hurt.</font>

218
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,930
<font color="yellow">- I missed you so much, Tae Yang. - Hey, you, Hyo Won!</font>

219
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,790
<font color="yellow">I sorted things out for you! Don't sabotage my efforts!</font>

220
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,190
<font color="yellow">You have the upper hand, so act like it!</font>

221
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,730
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

222
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,190
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

223
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

224
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,930
<font color="yellow">Have you talked to Yun Shil today?</font>

225
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,290
<font color="yellow">No, why?</font>

226
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,330
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil...</font>

227
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,960
<font color="yellow">disappeared.</font>

228
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,460
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, Yun Shil is missing?</font>

229
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,590
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

230
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,430
<font color="yellow">I went to her room and saw a letter. She was gone.</font>

231
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,630
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that Yun Shil left home...</font>

232
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,930
<font color="yellow">without telling you?</font>

233
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,090
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the tailor shop right away.</font>

234
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,190
<font color="yellow">Is that call from...</font>

235
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,460
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin? - Yes.</font>

236
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,530
<font color="yellow">What happened to Dong Jin?</font>

237
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,090
<font color="yellow">As far as I heard...</font>

238
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,260
<font color="yellow">it seems that your friend left Dong Jin's house.</font>

239
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,630
<font color="yellow">Does it mean that she broke up with Dong Jin?</font>

240
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,960
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

241
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,490
<font color="yellow">I have to leave because of an urgent matter.</font>

242
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,190
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

243
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,990
<font color="yellow">Bye, honey.</font>

244
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,130
<font color="yellow">What's the matter? What happened?</font>

245
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,490
<font color="yellow">It seems Dong Jin and that girl...</font>

246
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,090
<font color="yellow">- broke up. - Really?</font>

247
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,130
<font color="yellow">What happened, Dong Jin?</font>

248
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,130
<font color="yellow">Why has Yun Shil left home suddenly?</font>

249
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,960
<font color="yellow">- I have no idea. - Something might have happened...</font>

250
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,460
<font color="yellow">to Yun Shil while you haven't noticed.</font>

251
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,860
<font color="yellow">I have no idea why she left.</font>

252
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,360
<font color="yellow">I decided to be someone...</font>

253
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,690
<font color="yellow">that Yun Shil can trust and rely on.</font>

254
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,390
<font color="yellow">I'm so angry at myself and Yun Shil...</font>

255
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,230
<font color="yellow">since I made her leave without telling me...</font>

256
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,930
<font color="yellow">she was troubled.</font>

257
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,290
<font color="yellow">I don't know what really happened,</font>

258
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,160
<font color="yellow">but I guess she left because she didn't want to trouble you.</font>

259
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,560
<font color="yellow">She'd rather trouble herself than make someone troubled for her.</font>

260
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,990
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Ms Geum is calling...</font>

261
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,230
<font color="yellow">every customer.</font>

262
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,660
<font color="yellow">We'll find Yun Shil soon.</font>

263
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,330
<font color="yellow">I'll contact every friend at hometown.</font>

264
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,790
<font color="yellow">When the sun is strong,</font>

265
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,690
<font color="yellow">strawberries soften up and become valueless.</font>

266
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,290
<font color="yellow">That's why we have to start working early in the morning.</font>

267
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,990
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

268
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,090
<font color="yellow">Since it's your first day here,</font>

269
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,060
<font color="yellow">follow me watching how I do...</font>

270
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,230
<font color="yellow">and start working right away.</font>

271
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,290
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll do my best.</font>

272
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,090
<font color="yellow">It's just picking up fruits. It's not hard.</font>

273
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,430
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, are you in there?</font>

274
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,290
<font color="yellow">Are you there?</font>

275
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,000
<font color="yellow">Who's calling me?</font>

276
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,160
<font color="yellow">It must be Madam Ko.</font>

277
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,930
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

278
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,030
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time since I saw you.</font>

279
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,260
<font color="yellow">I also wanted to talk to you about our children.</font>

280
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,730
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm here.</font>

281
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,730
<font color="yellow">- May I come in? - I don't care whatever you do.</font>

282
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,230
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

283
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,890
<font color="yellow">I guess Mr Lee is not home.</font>

284
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,530
<font color="yellow">He went to a go club to play.</font>

285
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,390
<font color="yellow">He entrusted Dong Jin with the tailor shop and enjoys his life.</font>

286
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,090
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

287
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,500
<font color="yellow">ox tail.</font>

288
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,830
<font color="yellow">Boil it and cook for Mr Lee.</font>

289
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,830
<font color="yellow">Why have you brought that? I feel uncomfortable.</font>

290
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,730
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

291
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,460
<font color="yellow">why did you come here without telling me?</font>

292
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,930
<font color="yellow">I'd like our children...</font>

293
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,560
<font color="yellow">to be reunited, Ms Choi.</font>

294
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,560
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about Dong Jin and Hyo Joo.</font>

295
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,500
<font color="yellow">I heard that Dong Jin's new girlfriend,</font>

296
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,560
<font color="yellow">the ex-convict's wife left this morning.</font>

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,860
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? Girlfriend of whom?</font>

298
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,790
<font color="yellow">Be careful of what you say.</font>

299
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,290
<font color="yellow">How can you speak of the ex-convict's wife?</font>

300
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,360
<font color="yellow">I heard that she fell in love with Dong Jin...</font>

301
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,790
<font color="yellow">while her husband was in a jail.</font>

302
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,830
<font color="yellow">You speak so carelessly.</font>

303
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,660
<font color="yellow">She didn't finish the wedding...</font>

304
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,460
<font color="yellow">nor did she register her marriage.</font>

305
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,190
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is a single woman.</font>

306
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,790
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter whether she is a single woman or a widow.</font>

307
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,960
<font color="yellow">It seems that Hyo Joo...</font>

308
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,160
<font color="yellow">still has feelings for Dong Jin.</font>

309
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,060
<font color="yellow">So, you and I...</font>

310
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,460
<font color="yellow">should plan a strategy...</font>

311
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,890
<font color="yellow">and make them reunited.</font>

312
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,690
<font color="yellow">If you want them to be reunited, you should stay out of it.</font>

313
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,130
<font color="yellow">I feel heavy when I even think of...</font>

314
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,230
<font color="yellow">being related with you.</font>

315
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,130
<font color="yellow">Do you have to keep calling me Ms Ko?</font>

316
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,890
<font color="yellow">I was once your son's parent-in-law.</font>

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,790
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't call me that way.</font>

318
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,000
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with it.</font>

319
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,690
<font color="yellow">You'll always be Ms Ko to me.</font>

320
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,330
<font color="yellow">I was crazy.</font>

321
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,530
<font color="yellow">Why have I come here in this cold weather?</font>

322
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,860
<font color="yellow">My goodness, how are you?</font>

323
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,060
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

324
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,890
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

325
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,530
<font color="yellow">As a matter of fact,</font>

326
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,530
<font color="yellow">I've wanted to visit you and talk to you.</font>

327
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,460
<font color="yellow">It's nice to see you here.</font>

328
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,560
<font color="yellow">What did you want to talk about?</font>

329
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,160
<font color="yellow">Young Eun hasn't changed a bit.</font>

330
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,860
<font color="yellow">I won't be surprised if she makes Sam Do's heart flutters.</font>

331
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,730
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

332
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

333
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,360
<font color="yellow">There are so many other places in Seoul.</font>

334
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
<font color="yellow">Why has she opened her bakery here?</font>

335
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,890
<font color="yellow">I don't understand.</font>

336
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,260
<font color="yellow">- Is she still missing Sam Do? - That's what I'm saying.</font>

337
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she has a secret design.</font>

338
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,360
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What are you going to do?</font>

339
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,260
<font color="yellow">I want you to meet that vixen and find out...</font>

340
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,330
<font color="yellow">why she has come to this town.</font>

341
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,260
<font color="yellow">- Me? - You said you've known her long.</font>

342
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,790
<font color="yellow">No, I don't know her very well.</font>

343
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,590
<font color="yellow">I just saw her several times when she visited the tailor shop.</font>

344
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,730
<font color="yellow">When I think of that vixen,</font>

345
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,030
<font color="yellow">I have such a headache that I feel like I'm dying.</font>

346
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,790
<font color="yellow">I might die before my time. Please help me.</font>

347
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,960
<font color="yellow">I don't usually care about...</font>

348
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,960
<font color="yellow">someone else's matter.</font>

349
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,530
<font color="yellow">Please, Madam Ko.</font>

350
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,890
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

351
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,530
<font color="yellow">I'll ask everything about her in detail.</font>

352
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,490
<font color="yellow">- Wait here. - I trust you.</font>

353
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,690
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

354
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,790
<font color="yellow">Do you remember me?</font>

355
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,530
<font color="yellow">You saw me at the Wolgyesu Tailor Shop before.</font>

356
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, I remember.</font>

357
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,790
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

358
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,830
<font color="yellow">Good. It's been a long time.</font>

359
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,390
<font color="yellow">It's been so long.</font>

360
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,460
<font color="yellow">- Please have a seat. - All right.</font>

361
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,390
<font color="yellow">This shop is nice. It's neat and tidy.</font>

362
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,860
<font color="yellow">I heard that you were living in America.</font>

363
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,490
<font color="yellow">What made you open a bakery here?</font>

364
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,630
<font color="yellow">It's a long story.</font>

365
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,990
<font color="yellow">I see. I have plenty of time today.</font>

366
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,790
<font color="yellow">We have enough time to talk.</font>

367
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,630
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I haven't served you tea.</font>

368
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,690
<font color="yellow">- What kind of tea do you like? - Me?</font>

369
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,660
<font color="yellow">I'd like to have earl grey.</font>

370
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,160
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

371
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,230
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

372
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,860
<font color="yellow">What is happening to me?</font>

373
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,260
<font color="yellow">I'd better tell them now that I can't do this.</font>

374
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,830
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about, Dad?</font>

375
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,760
<font color="yellow">My heart is pounding...</font>

376
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,790
<font color="yellow">to imagine that I will be on a big stage again.</font>

377
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,660
<font color="yellow">I feel like my heart would burst.</font>

378
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,830
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Sung Jun.</font>

379
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,530
<font color="yellow">You used to actively work here in the past.</font>

380
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,090
<font color="yellow">Why are you being tense?</font>

381
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,060
<font color="yellow">You're done at the Da Jeong beauty salon.</font>

382
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,730
<font color="yellow">He looks much better with a professional touch.</font>

383
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,730
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Da Jeong.</font>

384
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

385
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,690
<font color="yellow">Let me go to the washroom first.</font>

386
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,790
<font color="yellow">How many times have you been going to the washroom?</font>

387
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,230
<font color="yellow">He must be nervous.</font>

388
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,490
<font color="yellow">Why should he be tense? He just needs to sing as he can.</font>

389
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,060
<font color="yellow">By the way, it's so amazing to see the stars I used to watch...</font>

390
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,160
<font color="yellow">on television.</font>

391
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,960
<font color="yellow">We should have brought your grandparents here.</font>

392
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,790
<font color="yellow">Once Dad's new song gets popular,</font>

393
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,860
<font color="yellow">we'll get to come to the broadcasting station often.</font>

394
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,860
<font color="yellow">We can bring grandparents, then.</font>

395
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,990
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

396
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,460
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

397
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,360
<font color="yellow">I don't think I am. My legs are shaking...</font>

398
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,890
<font color="yellow">and my hearts is going to burst out.</font>

399
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,830
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can sing, Dong Sook.</font>

400
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,190
<font color="yellow">Be stronger.</font>

401
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,290
<font color="yellow">Just be yourself.</font>

402
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,530
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be nervous, Jun.</font>

403
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,530
<font color="yellow">I brought herbal medicine to calm you down.</font>

404
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,090
<font color="yellow">- Herbal medicine? - Yes, you should take some.</font>

405
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,190
<font color="yellow">How do you feel now?</font>

406
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,160
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung, you're next. Please be on standby.</font>

407
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,960
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

408
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,330
<font color="yellow">- I need to use the washroom again. - What?</font>

409
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,660
<font color="yellow">He's driving me crazy.</font>

410
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,790
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

411
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,530
<font color="yellow">We'll be watching you, so don't worry and do a good job.</font>

412
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,390
<font color="yellow">You can't go to the washroom in the middle of performing, okay?</font>

413
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,730
<font color="yellow">He won't, of course.</font>

414
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,360
<font color="yellow">Let us wish you a good luck.</font>

415

<font color="yellow">Please make it become a mega hit.</font>

418

426

427

<font color="yellow">That's not what's important.</font>

432
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,560
<font color="yellow">She kept asking me to take care of things...</font>

433
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,990
<font color="yellow">and acted differently from usual. I should've known.</font>

434
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,030
<font color="yellow">I... I was insensitive. It's my fault.</font>

435

<font color="yellow">so I have no idea why suddenly...</font>

439

<font color="yellow">I really don't get it.</font>

440

<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Lee.</font>

443
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,990
<font color="yellow">We're all feeling a bit down, so let's have soju together.</font>

444
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,060
<font color="yellow">I think that life...</font>

445
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,830
<font color="yellow">is a series of meetings and partings.</font>

446

<font color="yellow">We all go through it repeatedly, you know.</font>

447

<font color="yellow">You two will meet again if you're meant to be.</font>

448
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,630
<font color="yellow">I know that the process will be difficult and painful,</font>

449
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,530
<font color="yellow">but don't let your heart get wounded.</font>

<font color="yellow">Come!</font>

454
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,260
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you this now.</font>

455
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this?</font>

456
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,360
<font color="yellow">When Mi Soon left me, I felt like my entire world had collapsed.</font>

457

<font color="yellow">But I met your mum after that...</font>

458

<font color="yellow">and made a happy family together as you know.</font>

<font color="yellow">all of those painful memories become faint and get forgotten.</font>

461

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr Lee.</font>

462

463
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,730
<font color="yellow">My first love.</font>

464
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,430
<font color="yellow">You had someone like that, too?</font>

465
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,490
<font color="yellow">You silly. I'm a man, too.</font>

466
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,130
<font color="yellow">Of course I have a first love.</font>

467
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,960
<font color="yellow">Hearing this is making me feel better for some reason.</font>

468
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,560
<font color="yellow">But I must say,</font>

469
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,630
<font color="yellow">I think that first love...</font>

470
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,060
<font color="yellow">is like a volcano.</font>

471
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,230
<font color="yellow">Even though you had forgotten all about it,</font>

472
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,090
<font color="yellow">it can erupt like a volcano at any time.</font>

473
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,590
<font color="yellow">You thought you had completely erased it from your heart,</font>

474
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,360
<font color="yellow">but when you meet your first love again, you feel it more intensely.</font>

475
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,130
<font color="yellow">A man's first love...</font>

476
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,660
<font color="yellow">sure makes him cry.</font>

477
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
<font color="yellow">This may sound strange,</font>

478
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,530
<font color="yellow">but to me,</font>

479
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,830
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil was like my first love.</font>

480
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,430
<font color="yellow">No one has made my heart...</font>

481
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,760
<font color="yellow">flutter as much as she did.</font>

482
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,960
<font color="yellow">All right. On that note,</font>

483
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,760
<font color="yellow">let's think about our first loves and drink up.</font>

485
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,290
<font color="yellow">Spin it like this. You see the plastic cover going up, right?</font>

486
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,790
<font color="yellow">When it's warm, you can roll it up like this.</font>

487
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,290
<font color="yellow">- Roll it down when it's cold. - I see.</font>

488
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,490
<font color="yellow">Try rolling it down.</font>

489
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,630
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

490
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,990
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have to roll it up at night,</font>

491
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,390
<font color="yellow">but I'm showing you just in case.</font>

492
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,460
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

493
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,330
<font color="yellow">And these are candles.</font>

494
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,190
<font color="yellow">When the temperature drops to below 10°C,</font>

495
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,460
<font color="yellow">you have to light these candles and put them between the furrows.</font>

496
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,230
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, you'll ruin all of your hard work.</font>

497
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,260
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

498
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,160
<font color="yellow">It'd be good to just turn on the heater,</font>

499
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,960
<font color="yellow">but that will be too expensive.</font>

500
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,360
<font color="yellow">Be careful with them, though. It's a fire hazard.</font>

501
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,660
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll keep that in mind.</font>

<font color="yellow">Grape stain is hard to remove.</font>

512
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,030

513

<font color="yellow">call me at least. I'll be waiting.</font>

515

<font color="yellow">Darling.</font>

516
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,190
<font color="yellow">- I'm here. - Hey.</font>

517
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,960
<font color="yellow">Did you see Dong Jin?</font>

518
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,790
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

519
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,930
<font color="yellow">You said that your friend and Dong Jin like each other.</font>

520
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,190
<font color="yellow">Why did she leave out of the blue?</font>

521
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,360
<font color="yellow">I can't get a hold of her now, so I'm not sure,</font>

522
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,460
<font color="yellow">but I think that she left...</font>

523
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,690
<font color="yellow">because she thought that she'd make his life difficult if she stayed.</font>

524
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,560
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

525
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,460
<font color="yellow">She can't leave like that, though.</font>

526
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens,</font>

527
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,860
<font color="yellow">I'll never leave you.</font>

528
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

529
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,430
<font color="yellow">Even if you get sick of me and beg me to leave,</font>

530
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,290
<font color="yellow">I'll be glued to you...</font>

531
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,330

<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

533
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,130
<font color="yellow">I happened to read...</font>

534
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,860
<font color="yellow">news about Mr Min and the announcer, Choi Ji Yun.</font>

535
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,790
<font color="yellow">Did you read the article about them getting married?</font>

536
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,230
<font color="yellow">Did your mum approve it?</font>

537
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,400
<font color="yellow">To be honest, my mum wasn't happy about it,</font>

538
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,460
<font color="yellow">but the article has been published,</font>

539
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,490
<font color="yellow">so she doesn't really have a choice now.</font>

540

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,760
<font color="yellow">Put a little extra water when you make rice.</font>

542
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,330
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

543
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,160
<font color="yellow">What kind of side dishes does she like?</font>

544
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,900
<font color="yellow">Unlike how she looks,</font>

545
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,830
<font color="yellow">she loves traditional dishes.</font>

546
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,430
<font color="yellow">Fermented soybean paste stew...</font>

547
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,860
<font color="yellow">and all sorts of pickles.</font>

548
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,360
<font color="yellow">She likes things that are salty and spicy.</font>

549
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,760
<font color="yellow">Her taste is the opposite of mine.</font>

550
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,160
<font color="yellow">Are you preparing for married life?</font>

551
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,990
<font color="yellow">That sounds a bit too grand.</font>

552
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,960
<font color="yellow">I was just asking her what kind of food your mum likes.</font>

553
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,590
<font color="yellow">Shall we take a quick break?</font>

554
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,260
<font color="yellow">Seeing you doing housework in an apron makes me...</font>

555
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,430
<font color="yellow">feel like we're already married.</font>

556
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,060
<font color="yellow">We'll be able to get married, right?</font>

557
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,260
<font color="yellow">Of course. I mean, everyone already knows about it.</font>

558
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,760
<font color="yellow">My mum has no choice now.</font>

559
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,160
<font color="yellow">She'll have to give us permission.</font>

560
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,790
<font color="yellow">Having drinks with you and Dong Jin...</font>

561
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,400
<font color="yellow">is putting me in such a good mood.</font>

562
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,360
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee. You're okay, right?</font>

563
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,760
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

564
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,630
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm sorry for worrying you.</font>

565
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,160
<font color="yellow">If I don't want to deal with any worries,</font>

566
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,790
<font color="yellow">I should just be buried in a coffin.</font>

567
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,090
<font color="yellow">This is proof that I'm alive,</font>

568
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,030
<font color="yellow">so don't feel bad about it.</font>

569
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,690
<font color="yellow">I completely agree with you, Mr Lee.</font>

570
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,130
<font color="yellow">Those who are destined to meet will meet.</font>

571
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,060
<font color="yellow">If Yun Shil and you are meant to be,</font>

572
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,900
<font color="yellow">you two will end up meeting again, so don't be so devastated.</font>

573
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,130
<font color="yellow">Let's go home now, guys.</font>

574
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,190
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, Dong Jin and you should go ahead.</font>

575
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,430
<font color="yellow">I have to stop by somewhere.</font>

576
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,690
<font color="yellow">- All right. See you at home. - Okay.</font>

577
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,530
<font color="yellow">What's going on, Sam Do?</font>

578
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,260
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I just have to see someone briefly. Go with Mr Lee.</font>

579
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,030
<font color="yellow">Young Eun.</font>

580
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,690
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

581
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,760
<font color="yellow">- Did you drink? - Yes, a little.</font>

582
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,130
<font color="yellow">Do I reek of alcohol? Shall I just leave?</font>

583
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
<font color="yellow">No, I just smell it a little bit. Don't worry and have a seat.</font>

584
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,590
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some tea? - Sure. Thanks.</font>

585
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,360
<font color="yellow">- You're home. - Yes.</font>

586
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,160
<font color="yellow">Where's Sam Do?</font>

587
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,030
<font color="yellow">He said he has to stop by somewhere, so we came without him.</font>

588
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,860
<font color="yellow">Where did this man go?</font>

589
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll be home shortly.</font>

590
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,900
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Good night, Mr Lee. - You, too.</font>

591
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,530
<font color="yellow">You haven't heard anything from Yun Shil yet?</font>

592
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,230
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

593
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,230
<font color="yellow">You must be so worried and stressed out.</font>

594
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,790
<font color="yellow">- I'll head to my room. - All right.</font>

595
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,860
<font color="yellow">It looks like he went to see that woman at the bakery.</font>

596
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,190
<font color="yellow">I'll catch them in the act...</font>

597
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,960
<font color="yellow">and crush them.</font>

598
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,930
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

599
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,730
<font color="yellow">I'm making dinner.</font>

600
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,230
<font color="yellow">Just because Yun Shil left doesn't mean things will change.</font>

601
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,630
<font color="yellow">You have no reason to be here.</font>

602
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,990
<font color="yellow">I know what you're trying to say,</font>

603
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,330
<font color="yellow">but I'll be better from now on. Please?</font>

604
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,590
<font color="yellow">Nothing is more pointless than married couples' spats.</font>

605
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,790
<font color="yellow">Many couples get divorced only to reunite later.</font>

606
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,900
<font color="yellow">So try to talk things through...</font>

607
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,790
<font color="yellow">to clear up the misunderstandings you have.</font>

608
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,690
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo and I...</font>

609
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,190
<font color="yellow">are over. Why are you being like this, Mum?</font>

610
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother. Dong Jin.</font>

611
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,230
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

612
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,630
<font color="yellow">I understand why you're reacting like this.</font>

613
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,190
<font color="yellow">I've been reflecting on things that I've done.</font>

614
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,960

744
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,530
<font color="yellow">The only reason for Yun Shil to run away from home suddenly...</font>

745
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,090
<font color="yellow">has to be because of Mother.</font>

746
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,890
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

747
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,530
<font color="yellow">My mum did say some things to Yun Shil,</font>

748
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,290
<font color="yellow">but I doubt she told Yun Shil to move out.</font>

749
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,730
<font color="yellow">Then Mother does know about...</font>

750

<font color="yellow">the relationship between Dong Jin and Yun Shil.</font>

751
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,990
<font color="yellow">I was about to tell her,</font>

752
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,090

753
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,530

754
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,660

755
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,890
<font color="yellow">Sam Do, come get a drink.</font>

756
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,960

757
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,860
<font color="yellow">He looks really mad.</font>

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,430
<font color="yellow">I can't stand it.</font>

762
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,030
<font color="yellow">I didn't want Young Eun to see me like that.</font>

763

<font color="yellow">What? What happened?</font>

764
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:05,290
