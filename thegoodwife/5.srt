1
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,091
<font color="yellow">I looked up your records.</font>

2
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,901
<font color="yellow">I was wondering why you registered late as a lawyer,</font>

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,331
<font color="yellow">and I found out that you had a car accident before.</font>

4
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,161
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of you until the end.</font>

5
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,231
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is trust me. Got it?</font>

6
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,291
<font color="yellow">I know you started work late because of me.</font>

7
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:38,761
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

8
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,761
<font color="yellow">That's when...</font>

9
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,891
<font color="yellow">My leg also became like this.</font>

10
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:48,431
<font color="yellow">Can you define one's feelings?</font>

11
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51,331
<font color="yellow">I love Lee Tae Joon,</font>

12
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,391
<font color="yellow">but I also hate him. My feelings change every day.</font>

13
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,231
<font color="yellow">Are my feelings that important to you?</font>

14
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,791
<font color="yellow">Are you that curious?</font>

15
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:53,761
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you have something to say?</font>

16
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,091
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

17
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,331
<font color="yellow">Dad, take a look at this. It's weird.</font>

18
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,331
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

19
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,461
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. I captured it from the front of our house.</font>

20
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,061
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, what are you doing in Dad's room?</font>

21
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,061
<font color="yellow">Coming.</font>

22
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:15,661
<font color="yellow">Take a look and we can talk about it later.</font>

23
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,731
<font color="yellow">You're not having breakfast?</font>

24
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,531
<font color="yellow">No. See you later.</font>

25
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,361
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

26
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,431
<font color="yellow">Can you bring me the files I asked for?</font>

27
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,461
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

28
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,691
<font color="yellow">This is Lee Tae Joon's trial record,</font>

29
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,031
<font color="yellow">and this is the investigation record.</font>

30
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:42,031
<font color="yellow">These files were not open for review so I had trouble getting them.</font>

31
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,931
<font color="yellow">The prosecutors' office says that it could affect other cases.</font>

32
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,991
<font color="yellow">Luckily, I found some photographs that weren't released during trial.</font>

33
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,431
<font color="yellow">It's on the last page.</font>

34
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:52,231
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Why did you want these anyway?</font>

35
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,961
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Lawyer Kim?</font>

36
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,991
<font color="yellow">I have to review something regarding Dokwang Development.</font>

37
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,161
<font color="yellow">I see. Okay.</font>

38
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,331
<font color="yellow">Dan.</font>

39
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:02,691
<font color="yellow">- Did you work with Prosecutor Lee? - Yes.</font>

40
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,961
<font color="yellow">What is he like?</font>

41
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,931
<font color="yellow">He's smart, hearty and loyal.</font>

42
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:13,091
<font color="yellow">He has a lot of friends.</font>

43
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:14,891
<font color="yellow">He's like the big brother type.</font>

44
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,431
<font color="yellow">That's more positive than I thought you'd say.</font>

45
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,361
<font color="yellow">He always had to have what he wanted.</font>

46
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:24,591
<font color="yellow">Whether that's an investigation, a person or information. All of it.</font>

47
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,661
<font color="yellow">That's why he had a lot of enemies.</font>

48
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:56,161
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

49
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:58,361
<font color="yellow">- Like what? - The apartment.</font>

50
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:02,161
<font color="yellow">It reminds me of the time when we were newly-weds. It's cozy.</font>

51
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,031
<font color="yellow">It's half the size. At least the kids were smaller then.</font>

52
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:08,061
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you miss our old place?</font>

53
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,161
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

54
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:10,931
<font color="yellow">Yes, sometimes.</font>

55
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,061
<font color="yellow">It feels more strange than I expected...</font>

56
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:17,231
<font color="yellow">to see you off to work while I stay home.</font>

57
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,231
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you help with housework?</font>

58
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,831
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Dishes?</font>

59
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:26,091
<font color="yellow">Shall I do the dishes?</font>

60
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,691
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

61
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,931
<font color="yellow">did Eun Sook say anything else?</font>

62
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,361
<font color="yellow">I must have acted impatiently.</font>

63
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:48,561
<font color="yellow">Sang Il wiretapped your phone.</font>

64
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,591
<font color="yellow">- What? - That's all she knows.</font>

65
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,561
<font color="yellow">You figure out the rest.</font>

66
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,631
<font color="yellow">Whatever you do, don't harm us any more.</font>

67
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:02,161
<font color="yellow">Where shall I put these?</font>

68
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:04,161
<font color="yellow">Please put them here.</font>

69
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,531
<font color="yellow">You look very tired.</font>

70
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,331
<font color="yellow">I have quite a lot of work these days.</font>

71
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,291
<font color="yellow">How's your husband?</font>

72
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:16,631
<font color="yellow">He's the same.</font>

73
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,401
<font color="yellow">But he tries to be more careful than before.</font>

74
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:23,331
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim, you should still show no mercy.</font>

75
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:27,061
<font color="yellow">Once you start being forgiving since he's your children's father...</font>

76
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,761
<font color="yellow">after all,</font>

77
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:30,761
<font color="yellow">tragedy will start again.</font>

78
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,791
<font color="yellow">There are many men out there who are handsome and strong.</font>

79
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,661
<font color="yellow">If you'd like, I can introduce you to some.</font>

80
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,291
<font color="yellow">I'm too busy with meetings with Cho Guk Hyun.</font>

81
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,331
<font color="yellow">What do you think of President Seo Joong Won?</font>

82
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,991
<font color="yellow">He's nice and sexy.</font>

83
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,031
<font color="yellow">We're just friends.</font>

84
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:46,791
<font color="yellow">He's the only one I have left.</font>

85
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,691
<font color="yellow">- Lawyer Kim. - Yes?</font>

86
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:51,691
<font color="yellow">You have a guest waiting outside.</font>

87
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,091
<font color="yellow">He seemed like your son.</font>

88
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:54,691
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

89
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,491
<font color="yellow">He seemed to be in shock.</font>

90
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:08,731
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

91
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:09,891
<font color="yellow">Hello, Jae Yeol.</font>

92
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:13,361
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

93
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:14,961
<font color="yellow">Hi. You've grown a lot.</font>

94
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:16,631
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

95
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,891
<font color="yellow">I have a problem.</font>

96
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,861
<font color="yellow">I was hoping you'd help me.</font>

97
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,031
<font color="yellow">What I mean is,</font>

98
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,791
<font color="yellow">as a lawyer.</font>

99
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:35,491
<font color="yellow">(The Good Wife)</font>

100
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,091
<font color="yellow">I need the passcode to look.</font>

101
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,431
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later after you take a look.</font>

102
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,631
<font color="yellow">Tae Joon, do you remember me at the hospital?</font>

103
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,191
<font color="yellow">I'm Seo Joong Won.</font>

104
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,461
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's good to see you again.</font>

105
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,031
<font color="yellow">I can help you only if you tell me what's going on.</font>

106
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,291
<font color="yellow">I saw it in a drama that between a lawyer and a client...</font>

107
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,331
<font color="yellow">What was it called?</font>

108
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:23,731
<font color="yellow">Attorney-client privilege?</font>

109
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,261
<font color="yellow">Right. Yes.</font>

110
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:28,661
<font color="yellow">Whatever you tell me,</font>

111
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:30,291
<font color="yellow">I'll have to keep it confidential.</font>

112
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,361
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, my license as a lawyer will be removed.</font>

113
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:33,891
<font color="yellow">You can tell me honestly.</font>

114
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,691
<font color="yellow">Actually, Dong Hyun suggested we should steal the test papers.</font>

115
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,501
<font color="yellow">He said he knew where the key to the test papers' cabinet was.</font>

116
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,791
<font color="yellow">You and Dong Hyun?</font>

117
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:43,631
<font color="yellow">Is this the Dong Hyun that I know?</font>

118
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,361
<font color="yellow">We were just joking around. I was planning to just go home,</font>

119
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,191
<font color="yellow">but the teacher's lounge was unlocked.</font>

120
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,891
<font color="yellow">I was on the lookout, but the security came.</font>

121
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,631
<font color="yellow">That was unlucky.</font>

122
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,161
<font color="yellow">Did someone get hurt?</font>

123
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,861
<font color="yellow">No, I ran away as soon as I saw the security,</font>

124
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:02,631
<font color="yellow">but there were police cars at the school the next morning.</font>

125
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,431
<font color="yellow">Dong Hyun didn't answer his phone.</font>

126
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,561
<font color="yellow">Tell everything to your mum and ask for forgiveness at school.</font>

127
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,291
<font color="yellow">Don't make it worse. Just do as I say.</font>

128
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:19,161
<font color="yellow">Dan, may I ask you for a favour?</font>

129
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,391
<font color="yellow">Your son doesn't take after you at all.</font>

130
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,461
<font color="yellow">He isn't my son.</font>

131
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:27,161
<font color="yellow">Someone reported to the police at Sosang High School last night.</font>

132
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,961
<font color="yellow">Could you find out what's going on?</font>

133
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,361
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

134
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,961
<font color="yellow">I know his mother. Thank you.</font>

135
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,761
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

136
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,501
<font color="yellow">Do you have time?</font>

137
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:53,661
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

138
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:57,891
<font color="yellow">My friend's son came to see me.</font>

139
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,361
<font color="yellow">He said he got into trouble.</font>

140
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,291
<font color="yellow">Does he need a lawyer?</font>

141
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:06,031
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that.</font>

142
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,461
<font color="yellow">May I give him a ride back home?</font>

143
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:11,061
<font color="yellow">Ms Kim Hye Gyeong.</font>

144
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:15,391
<font color="yellow">I know what you're going to say. I'll do my best from now on.</font>

145
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:18,761
<font color="yellow">I'll do my tasks the best I can and look for clients.</font>

146
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:23,331
<font color="yellow">I feel bad just sending him home when he came to see me here.</font>

147
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:24,931
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

148
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,831
<font color="yellow">I just hope you'll think about why...</font>

149
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,061
<font color="yellow">you started working as a lawyer.</font>

150
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,191
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

151
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,691
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - How's Hye Gyeong?</font>

152
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,161
<font color="yellow">Is she all right at work?</font>

153
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,191
<font color="yellow">She's doing very well.</font>

154
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,031
<font color="yellow">She may have been too old to be selected as a new hire.</font>

155
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,291
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking care of her.</font>

156
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:50,631
<font color="yellow">How does it feel being out?</font>

157
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,261
<font color="yellow">I'm quite busy.</font>

158
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,431
<font color="yellow">I'll have to get ready for trial.</font>

159
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,291
<font color="yellow">Anyway, what brings you here?</font>

160
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,131
<font color="yellow">Do you know President Cho Guk Hyun of Dokwang Development?</font>

161
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:02,531
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

162
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,261
<font color="yellow">He's hired us for legal advice.</font>

163
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:08,561
<font color="yellow">Based on the records of your case,</font>

164
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,291
<font color="yellow">President Cho's name was mentioned quite a bit.</font>

165
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:13,891
<font color="yellow">Strangely, he avoided being charged by the prosecution.</font>

166
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,361
<font color="yellow">I've only met President Cho a few times...</font>

167
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,761
<font color="yellow">to collect some information.</font>

168
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,791
<font color="yellow">Close to him,</font>

169
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:26,431
<font color="yellow">there was a person related to Lawyer Kim's accident in the past.</font>

170
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,861
<font color="yellow">Do you remember Driver Kang Seok Beom?</font>

171
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,561
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

172
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:34,491
<font color="yellow">I heard President Cho helped out a lot with the settlement.</font>

173
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,361
<font color="yellow">I was excited as I was finishing at Judicial Training Institute.</font>

174
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,561
<font color="yellow">I regret not having to stop him.</font>

175
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,661
<font color="yellow">Yes, I find it very unfortunate.</font>

176
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,091
<font color="yellow">Had I been there that day,</font>

177
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,691
<font color="yellow">it wouldn't have happened.</font>

178
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,061
<font color="yellow">What can we do about the past?</font>

179
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,661
<font color="yellow">We can't...</font>

180
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,661
<font color="yellow">turn back time.</font>

181
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,791
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

182
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:08,661
<font color="yellow">Still, we shouldn't let the past bring us down.</font>

183
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,991
<font color="yellow">You're going through a lot already.</font>

184
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,491
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

185
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,191
<font color="yellow">Please talk to President Cho.</font>

186
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,991
<font color="yellow">He seemed to have a lot to say to you.</font>

187
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:24,831
<font color="yellow">Exclude Lawyer Kim Hye Gyeong.</font>

188
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,891
<font color="yellow">Have a private talk.</font>

189
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,791
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

190
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,731
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming all the way here...</font>

191
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,661
<font color="yellow">to give me advice.</font>

192
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,891
<font color="yellow">I care a lot about Lawyer Kim.</font>

193
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,461
<font color="yellow">There's no other reason.</font>

194
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:42,731
<font color="yellow">If you're worried about the talk...</font>

195
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:44,031
<font color="yellow">on television...</font>

196
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:47,091
<font color="yellow">It all happened because of me.</font>

197
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,661
<font color="yellow">I'm the one at fault for being absent from home.</font>

198
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,291
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say any more.</font>

199
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,461
<font color="yellow">So did you not go to school?</font>

200
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:04,461
<font color="yellow">I haven't gone for a few days.</font>

201
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:06,431
<font color="yellow">I don't like studying anyway.</font>

202
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,431
<font color="yellow">You were good at school though.</font>

203
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,031
<font color="yellow">It's because I studied all day and took private lessons.</font>

204
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:12,831
<font color="yellow">I'd be a fool if I weren't.</font>

205
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,661
<font color="yellow">But I've hit my limit.</font>

206
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:17,991
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give up soon.</font>

207
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,561
<font color="yellow">Aren't you giving up too soon?</font>

208
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,331
<font color="yellow">It's all my mum's fault.</font>

209
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:23,131
<font color="yellow">She knew students in that neighbourhood were studious.</font>

210
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:27,031
<font color="yellow">My grades would have been much better in my old neighbourhood.</font>

211
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,931
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. She moved all because of you.</font>

212
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,991
<font color="yellow">You're too cool.</font>

213
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,031
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Honestly,</font>

214
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,031
<font color="yellow">Mum wouldn't have gotten along there if it weren't for you.</font>

215
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,291
<font color="yellow">But she stopped contacting you after what happened.</font>

216
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,691
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too cold-hearted?</font>

217
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,291
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol.</font>

218
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,691
<font color="yellow">Your mum just wasn't strong enough.</font>

219
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:55,561
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

220
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,131
<font color="yellow">Yes, but...</font>

221
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,031
<font color="yellow">could you talk to her first?</font>

222
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:03,061
<font color="yellow">You're a lawyer.</font>

223
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,161
<font color="yellow">You used to be cute.</font>

224
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,091
<font color="yellow">- Wait, is that a diamond? - Yes.</font>

225
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,591
<font color="yellow">- Wow. - Did you get another one?</font>

226
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:32,991
<font color="yellow">- It's beautiful. - My husband...</font>

227
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:35,891
<font color="yellow">earned 10 million dollars again from his investment.</font>

228
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,831
<font color="yellow">- Again? - Really?</font>

229
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,831
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food. - No problem.</font>

230
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,331
<font color="yellow">Let me help.</font>

231
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:44,331
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. You should go and chat.</font>

232
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,991
<font color="yellow">I'll finish this up fast and join you.</font>

233
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,131
<font color="yellow">No. You've been working all by yourself.</font>

234
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:52,331
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm okay. - Can you guys bring empty plates?</font>

235
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,661
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong, why are you making a big deal?</font>

236
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,231
<font color="yellow">We were just careful with her china, that's all.</font>

237
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,661
<font color="yellow">We didn't intend on slacking off.</font>

238
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:02,631
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

239
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:03,661
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

240
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:05,631
<font color="yellow">- Here they are. - Thank you.</font>

241
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,891
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

242
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,391
<font color="yellow">It must still be unfamiliar since you just moved.</font>

243
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,731
<font color="yellow">You'll get used to it soon.</font>

244
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,191
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

245
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,791
<font color="yellow">I'll do the dishes.</font>

246
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,461
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.</font>

247
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,431
<font color="yellow">How did you get this?</font>

248
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:23,731
<font color="yellow">You know... I know someone and they helped me get a deal.</font>

249
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,461
<font color="yellow">- I want it, too. - You're lucky.</font>

250
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,561
<font color="yellow">- I was surprised. - We can go together next time.</font>

251
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,561
<font color="yellow">It's all about connections.</font>

252
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:33,961
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

253
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:36,431
<font color="yellow">I want one, too.</font>

254
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:37,431
<font color="yellow">Long time no see.</font>

255
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,161
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong.</font>

256
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,891
<font color="yellow">I was so worried about you.</font>

257
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:44,931
<font color="yellow">I didn't call since I figured you would be busy.</font>

258
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,931
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Are you well?</font>

259
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,031
<font color="yellow">I've been busy.</font>

260
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,391
<font color="yellow">- We moved and I started working. - I see.</font>

261
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,431
<font color="yellow">Do you have some time right now?</font>

262
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:56,431
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Her husband...</font>

263
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,761
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong, can I call you later?</font>

264
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,231
<font color="yellow">I'm talking with my neighbours.</font>

265
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,331
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be uncomfortable for both sides. I'll call later.</font>

266
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:06,591
<font color="yellow">It's about Jae Yeol.</font>

267
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:21,391
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

268
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,491
<font color="yellow">Can I see you at our place?</font>

269
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,961
<font color="yellow">He's driving me crazy.</font>

270
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:29,731
<font color="yellow">He's been making so much trouble lately...</font>

271
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:31,761
<font color="yellow">and he doesn't study at all.</font>

272
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,961
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it is, but he's going astray.</font>

273
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:36,561
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol is waiting outside.</font>

274
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,591
<font color="yellow">He regrets what he did.</font>

275
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,961
<font color="yellow">You should talk to him when you've calmed down.</font>

276
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,031
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

277
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:46,061
<font color="yellow">I caused you so much trouble.</font>

278
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:49,391
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I couldn't just send him away when he came to me.</font>

279
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:50,931
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

280
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,091
<font color="yellow">how are your kids?</font>

281
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:56,031
<font color="yellow">It must be tough for them after what happened.</font>

282
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,491
<font color="yellow">Are they being bullied or anything?</font>

283
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,331
<font color="yellow">Did their marks drop?</font>

284
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,891
<font color="yellow">Everyone's doing well.</font>

285
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:04,991
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

286
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,261
<font color="yellow">Where's Dong Hyun's mum? She seems to be away.</font>

287
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,491
<font color="yellow">She says she has something going on at home.</font>

288
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,201
<font color="yellow">She texted me this morning.</font>

289
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,361
<font color="yellow">Ever since you left,</font>

290
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,131
<font color="yellow">she acts like she's our boss.</font>

291
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:22,861
<font color="yellow">- About Jae Yeol... - Yes?</font>

292
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,361
<font color="yellow">Actually Dong Hyun...</font>

293
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,331
<font color="yellow">Hurry, come outside.</font>

294
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,091
<font color="yellow">Come on, hurry up. There's trouble.</font>

295
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,461
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - Hurry.</font>

296
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,201
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. - Jae Yeol!</font>

297
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:35,361
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to my son?</font>

298
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,631
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

299
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,531
<font color="yellow">On what charges are you taking him?</font>

300
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,531
<font color="yellow">Are you his family?</font>

301
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,931
<font color="yellow">No. I'm his lawyer.</font>

302
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,761
<font color="yellow">Do you have a warrant for his arrest?</font>

303
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:46,331
<font color="yellow">It's an exigent arrest. We gave him the Miranda warning already.</font>

304
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,361
<font color="yellow">- What's his charge? - Homicide.</font>

305
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,861
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Homicide?</font>

306
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,091
<font color="yellow">Mum! Mum!</font>

307
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,661
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol...</font>

308
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,631
<font color="yellow">What should we do? Should we call the police?</font>

309
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:08,201
<font color="yellow">Or do you want me to prepare a press conference first?</font>

310
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:09,891
<font color="yellow">If we arouse the public...</font>

311
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,661
<font color="yellow">by the wiretapping and breaking in,</font>

312
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:15,291
<font color="yellow">the court will also be pressured.</font>

313
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,561
<font color="yellow">Do you think we can prove...</font>

314
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,361
<font color="yellow">that the prosecutors' office did this?</font>

315
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:20,961
<font color="yellow">No, it won't be easy.</font>

316
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,761
<font color="yellow">It'll become a huge scandal.</font>

317
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,091
<font color="yellow">I think it would be better to leak information about a politician...</font>

318
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,031
<font color="yellow">or a prosecutor you were investigating on.</font>

319
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,291
<font color="yellow">That will be enough to turn the tables around.</font>

320
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,291
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Choi Sang Il...</font>

321
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:40,391
<font color="yellow">will spread the recording from the illegal wiretapping to the media.</font>

322
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:41,701
<font color="yellow">It'll be a dirty fight.</font>

323
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:44,061
<font color="yellow">We'll both be disclosing each other's secrets.</font>

324
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,791
<font color="yellow">We'll still have the upper hand.</font>

325
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:49,261
<font color="yellow">They will be more pressured than us.</font>

326
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,361
<font color="yellow">What if it's not the prosecutors' office?</font>

327
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:55,531
<font color="yellow">Who else would do that?</font>

328
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,031
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

329
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,561
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

330
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,961
<font color="yellow">I got this a few days before you were released.</font>

331
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,491
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's Cho Guk Hyun's doing?</font>

332
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:13,061
<font color="yellow">Who else would record such a thing?</font>

333
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:14,791
<font color="yellow">Right. One more.</font>

334
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,461
<font color="yellow">This came first.</font>

335
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:34,861
<font color="yellow">Is that really you?</font>

336
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,091
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

337
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:38,731
<font color="yellow">That's not me.</font>

338
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,661
<font color="yellow">I swear. I never did that.</font>

339
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,161
<font color="yellow">Someone's trying to break our family apart.</font>

340
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,531
<font color="yellow">They fabricated the photos.</font>

341
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,531
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

342
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:55,761
<font color="yellow">I would have been fooled if it wasn't for you.</font>

343
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,231
<font color="yellow">It's thanks to you that I got this chance.</font>

344
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,891
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

345
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:01,591
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

346
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:06,991
<font color="yellow">Also, this is just between the two of us.</font>

347
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,461
<font color="yellow">Mum might misunderstand if she finds out.</font>

348
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,391
<font color="yellow">When the ambulance arrived, he was already dead.</font>

349
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,491
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol told me he ran away as soon as he saw the guard.</font>

350
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,631
<font color="yellow">How can you believe what he says? He even dropped out of school.</font>

351
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:30,431
<font color="yellow">He didn't drop out. He just missed a few days.</font>

352
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:34,661
<font color="yellow">Also, we all go through puberty.</font>

353
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,701
<font color="yellow">You must know him well.</font>

354
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,861
<font color="yellow">His mother and I were the closest when I lived there.</font>

355
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:42,291
<font color="yellow">Then again, she was the first to stop calling after what happened.</font>

356
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:46,291
<font color="yellow">Life is full of betrayals.</font>

357
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,231
<font color="yellow">You betray others and others betray you, too.</font>

358
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,731
<font color="yellow">You should get used to it.</font>

359
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,561
<font color="yellow">In the police report, it says that the security guard...</font>

360
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,701
<font color="yellow">found Jae Yeol when he sneaked into the teachers' room.</font>

361
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:00,761
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol.</font>

362
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:05,701
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

363
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:07,791
<font color="yellow">- Who's there? - Run, run!</font>

364
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:12,731
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol pushed the security guard down while fleeing.</font>

365
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:16,631
<font color="yellow">The security guard had a cerebral haemorrhage as he hit his head.</font>

366
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,131
<font color="yellow">And the kid fled.</font>

367
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:24,961
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

368
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,261
<font color="yellow">It's me. Can you come home early tonight?</font>

369
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:29,091
<font color="yellow">There's something you should know about.</font>

370
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,461
<font color="yellow">Why? What is it?</font>

371
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:33,591
<font color="yellow">It's really important. I can't tell you over the line.</font>

372
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,161
<font color="yellow">I'm doing something urgent as well.</font>

373
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,791
<font color="yellow">A client was arrested for committing homicide.</font>

374
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,031
<font color="yellow">We'll talk later.</font>

375
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,631
<font color="yellow">You're doing well.</font>

376
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,201
<font color="yellow">Ms Kim.</font>

377
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:55,861
<font color="yellow">Ms Kim, over here.</font>

378
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,931
<font color="yellow">Can I leave right now?</font>

379
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,931
<font color="yellow">I can't stay here any longer.</font>

380
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:03,031
<font color="yellow">Not now.</font>

381
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,091
<font color="yellow">Did you lie to me about anything?</font>

382
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:07,931
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know that happened to the guard.</font>

383
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:09,131
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

384
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,191
<font color="yellow">I ran away as soon as I saw him.</font>

385
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,361
<font color="yellow">Did you push him?</font>

386
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:15,331
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't lie.</font>

387
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:18,931
<font color="yellow">They'll check if your DNA is on the security guard's clothes.</font>

388
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,291
<font color="yellow">We bumped into each other, but that's in front of the door.</font>

389
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:24,131
<font color="yellow">You bumped into him, but that's not why he died?</font>

390
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:26,531
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell her earlier?</font>

391
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:30,131
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it. Dong Hyun must have seen it. He was in the room.</font>

392
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:32,591
<font color="yellow">I told you, I was going to drop out.</font>

393
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,931
<font color="yellow">Why would I need the test papers?</font>

394
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:36,261
<font color="yellow">I was only helping Dong Hyun.</font>

395
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,691
<font color="yellow">Go and ask him.</font>

396
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,661
<font color="yellow">Is that Kim Dong Hyun you're talking about?</font>

397
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:40,791
<font color="yellow">- Your class president? - Yes.</font>

398
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,431
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

399
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:45,731
<font color="yellow">He's the one who said you pushed him over.</font>

400
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,243
<font color="yellow">Does Kim Dong Hyun admit that he went in to steal test papers?</font>

401
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,683
<font color="yellow">He claims that he went along because he's scared of Jae Yeol.</font>

402
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:08,883
<font color="yellow">He never wanted to steal the test papers...</font>

403
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,743
<font color="yellow">and never knew where the keys were.</font>

404
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:12,913
<font color="yellow">He says Jae Yeol went up to the teachers' room alone...</font>

405
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,483
<font color="yellow">and that he stayed on the first floor.</font>

406
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,943
<font color="yellow">They're blaming each other.</font>

407
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,413
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem like we'll have a good chance.</font>

408
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,743
<font color="yellow">Who will people trust more? The class president or Jae Yeol?</font>

409
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:22,743
<font color="yellow">They're well off, so they won't have any trouble paying us.</font>

410
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,283
<font color="yellow">We should do our best in defending them.</font>

411
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:26,683
<font color="yellow">Good job, Hye Gyeong.</font>

412
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:30,583
<font color="yellow">It might get more complicated if you're personally related.</font>

413
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,643
<font color="yellow">They will blame you if you lose and say they had their trust in you.</font>

414
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:35,413
<font color="yellow">You should focus on this case for a while.</font>

415
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:38,213
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Dokwang Development on my own.</font>

416
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:40,913
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

417
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:44,283
<font color="yellow">I'm not on good terms with Jae Yeol's parents.</font>

418
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:47,183
<font color="yellow">We drifted apart after what happened to my husband.</font>

419
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:50,313
<font color="yellow">They may not hire you as their lawyer then.</font>

420
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:51,583
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

421
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:55,713
<font color="yellow">I wanted to suggest making someone else their official lawyer.</font>

422
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,843
<font color="yellow">We can't help ruining the relationship during trial,</font>

423
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:03,143
<font color="yellow">but it isn't right if our prior relationship affects the trial.</font>

424
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:04,283
<font color="yellow">I don't understand.</font>

425
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:06,843
<font color="yellow">If you weren't close, why did you visit Jae Yeol's house?</font>

426
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:08,443
<font color="yellow">We aren't close any more,</font>

427
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,283
<font color="yellow">but we've known each other for a while.</font>

428
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,313
<font color="yellow">And I didn't know things would get this bad then.</font>

429
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:18,083
<font color="yellow">Even if the lawyer is someone else, since I know the school and...</font>

430
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:21,113
<font color="yellow">the neighbourhood, I'll take care of the paperwork and finding witnesses.</font>

431
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:25,983
<font color="yellow">You want someone else to take the case while you only assist?</font>

432
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:29,013
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think that's best for everyone.</font>

433
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,483
<font color="yellow">I'll have more time to work on Dokwang Development case.</font>

434
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:34,743
<font color="yellow">Focus on Jae Yeol's case for now.</font>

435
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,283
<font color="yellow">That kid shouldn't be sent to prison.</font>

436
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:45,613
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

437
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:50,683
<font color="yellow">About Dokwang Development...</font>

438
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:52,613
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong?</font>

439
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:53,943
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

440
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:55,683
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

441
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:58,383
<font color="yellow">is it because of Tae Joon?</font>

442
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:03,483
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to be out because of President Cho?</font>

443
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:04,543
<font color="yellow">It's not about that.</font>

444
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:06,283
<font color="yellow">Dokwang Development case is yours.</font>

445
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:08,213
<font color="yellow">I'll keep your name on the documents.</font>

446
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:10,683
<font color="yellow">However, you should focus on the murder case.</font>

447
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,283
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the other one.</font>

448
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,813
<font color="yellow">Pardon me for interrupting,</font>

449
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:17,343
<font color="yellow">but Jae Yeol's parents are here.</font>

450
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,383
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

451
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:24,843
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I must have been sensitive.</font>

452
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,213
<font color="yellow">Still, you don't need to protect me.</font>

453
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:29,843
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

454
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:40,583
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Why are you representing my son?</font>

455
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:43,183
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol asked me for help.</font>

456
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:45,843
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for what we owe you today, so let's end it soon.</font>

457
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,313
<font color="yellow">Another lawyer I know will take his case, so you should leave it.</font>

458
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,683
<font color="yellow">I'm probably not as experienced as the other lawyer,</font>

459
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,583
<font color="yellow">but I'm confident that I care about Jae Yeol more.</font>

460
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,813
<font color="yellow">I know about the school and the neighbourhood better than anyone.</font>

461
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,283
<font color="yellow">I can be his best lawyer.</font>

462
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:04,413
<font color="yellow">Still, aren't you too inexperienced?</font>

463
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,413
<font color="yellow">Honey,</font>

464
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:07,443
<font color="yellow">please listen to her.</font>

465
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,113
<font color="yellow">If you can't trust me,</font>

466
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:13,583
<font color="yellow">I'll work with another lawyer from my firm.</font>

467
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:15,683
<font color="yellow">Would you trust us more then?</font>

468
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:34,283
<font color="yellow">I changed the passcode.</font>

469
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:37,113
<font color="yellow">I changed it temporarily. Let me know if you want to change it.</font>

470
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:43,113
<font color="yellow">Why did you change the passcode? Is that why you called me today?</font>

471
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,583
<font color="yellow">Dad, it's your turn.</font>

472
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,743
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello, Mum.</font>

473
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:47,943
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

474
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,843
<font color="yellow">- She's doing well. - Really?</font>

475
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:51,943
<font color="yellow">- Here I go. - One, two, one, two.</font>

476
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,213
<font color="yellow">You're doing so well.</font>

477
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:55,313
<font color="yellow">Dad, you're hitting me too much.</font>

478
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,283
<font color="yellow">Come on, Seo Yeon.</font>

479
00:26:58,213 --> 00:26:59,713
<font color="yellow">You're so good.</font>

480
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:27,343
<font color="yellow">I heard Jae Yeol is arrested for murder.</font>

481
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:29,113
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

482
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,443
<font color="yellow">Our children told me...</font>

483
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,343
<font color="yellow">that it was posted on their old friends' SNS.</font>

484
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:35,943
<font color="yellow">I heard their exams have been postponed.</font>

485
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:38,913
<font color="yellow">Can you believe that a child that we know have been...</font>

486
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:41,483
<font color="yellow">arrested for theft and murder?</font>

487
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,613
<font color="yellow">They're uneducated and greedy.</font>

488
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:48,283
<font color="yellow">You took good care of them when they moved here.</font>

489
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:50,143
<font color="yellow">After what happened to you,</font>

490
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:52,213
<font color="yellow">they stopped contacting you, right?</font>

491
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:55,183
<font color="yellow">They're no better than that.</font>

492
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:58,943
<font color="yellow">Just consider it only as your work. They're not good for us.</font>

493
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:02,983
<font color="yellow">Who's good for us then?</font>

494
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:07,113
<font color="yellow">After what happened to you, everyone else turned their backs.</font>

495
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:09,583
<font color="yellow">Our children have a father who cheated on his wife.</font>

496
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,113
<font color="yellow">Who would welcome us?</font>

497
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:14,643
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm working hard to fight...</font>

498
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,513
<font color="yellow">to prove my innocence...</font>

499
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:20,013
<font color="yellow">so that you and the children can live the way you used to.</font>

500
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,583
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong.</font>

501
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:29,143
<font color="yellow">Even the politicians have their eyes on us.</font>

502
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:33,843
<font color="yellow">Once things straighten out, I can climb higher up the ladder.</font>

503
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:37,313
<font color="yellow">We can't care for people we used to know.</font>

504
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,783
<font color="yellow">You must help me.</font>

505
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:42,283
<font color="yellow">We must trust each other and work together.</font>

506
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:45,513
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

507
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,643
<font color="yellow">Trust me...</font>

508
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,513
<font color="yellow">like you used to.</font>

509
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,913
<font color="yellow">Can we go in when they have exams?</font>

510
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:10,113
<font color="yellow">Exams are postponed until they find out if the exams have been leaked.</font>

511
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:12,943
<font color="yellow">It'll be easy for us to work since the students are studying.</font>

512
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:14,643
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

513
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:16,883
<font color="yellow">I used to live here.</font>

514
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,513
<font color="yellow">I was part of the management committee of this school.</font>

515
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:23,183
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

516
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:26,443
<font color="yellow">I'd forgotten that you used to be a local here.</font>

517
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:29,083
<font color="yellow">I'm not any more.</font>

518
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:37,183
<font color="yellow">Don't we know that person?</font>

519
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,083
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim, Dan.</font>

520
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:41,513
<font color="yellow">Keep playing.</font>

521
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,483
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - What are you doing?</font>

522
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,783
<font color="yellow">I'm playing a football game. Didn't you see me score?</font>

523
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,583
<font color="yellow">I played football when I was young.</font>

524
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:50,643
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm asking.</font>

525
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,313
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

526
00:29:52,683 --> 00:29:55,583
<font color="yellow">I heard you needed a lawyer to take charge of the trial.</font>

527
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,643
<font color="yellow">- Then... - Don't worry.</font>

528
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:01,413
<font color="yellow">I worked on many student cases while at the legal aid corporation.</font>

529
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,743
<font color="yellow">Not to brag, but I get along with children very well.</font>

530
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:07,383
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

531
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:09,283
<font color="yellow">Let's do well.</font>

532
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:10,843
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

533
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:18,283
<font color="yellow">Other students told me that Jae Yeol was unique but not bad.</font>

534
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:21,413
<font color="yellow">If he wasn't sleeping in class, he listened to music.</font>

535
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:22,543
<font color="yellow">He sometimes skipped class.</font>

536
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,613
<font color="yellow">He was peaceful like a plant,</font>

537
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:27,943
<font color="yellow">but the class president was quite troublesome.</font>

538
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,443
<font color="yellow">Do you know how rich and studious kids become bullies these days?</font>

539
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:34,383
<font color="yellow">His grades were getting worse these days,</font>

540
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,583
<font color="yellow">which was his motive for stealing the test papers.</font>

541
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,383
<font color="yellow">Did the students tell you all that?</font>

542
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:40,583
<font color="yellow">Did you see me play football?</font>

543
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:44,513
<font color="yellow">They tell me everything when I ask them while playing sports.</font>

544
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:48,313
<font color="yellow">I think you got the answers you wanted to hear.</font>

545
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,683
<font color="yellow">No, they're helpful to us.</font>

546
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,413
<font color="yellow">Joon Ho,</font>

547
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:56,143
<font color="yellow">will you argue that Dong Hyun persuaded Jae Yeol to steal?</font>

548
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,283
<font color="yellow">Yes, why would Jae Yeol have a reason to steal the test papers?</font>

549
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:00,843
<font color="yellow">He said he'd quit school anyway.</font>

550
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:02,913
<font color="yellow">It was all planned by Dong Hyun.</font>

551
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,983
<font color="yellow">We should argue that Dong Hyun tripped the security...</font>

552
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:07,643
<font color="yellow">which led to his death.</font>

553
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:10,383
<font color="yellow">Isn't that too extreme?</font>

554
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:12,643
<font color="yellow">We should defend Jae Yeol instead of...</font>

555
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:14,283
<font color="yellow">All the blame will fall on him.</font>

556
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:15,983
<font color="yellow">He might even go to prison.</font>

557
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:18,183
<font color="yellow">Are you all right with ruining his life?</font>

558
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,743
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll take care of it.</font>

559
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:26,313
<font color="yellow">You called me because you can't do things like this.</font>

560
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:21,683
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Dong Hyun?</font>

561
00:32:23,183 --> 00:32:24,883
<font color="yellow">I'm Ji Hoon's mum.</font>

562
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:28,483
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

563
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:31,843
<font color="yellow">Can we talk for a moment?</font>

564
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:32,883
<font color="yellow">He...</font>

565
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:34,483
<font color="yellow">told everything to the police.</font>

566
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:36,843
<font color="yellow">If you have questions,</font>

567
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:38,883

00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:40,343
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

571
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:47,143
<font color="yellow">You must be struggling these days, taking on a case like this.</font>

572
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,983
<font color="yellow">I couldn't ignore the situation Jae Yeol was in.</font>

597
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:28,183
<font color="yellow">That means he admitted to his attempt of theft.</font>

<font color="yellow">Detective. When Kim Dong Hyun confessed about the crime,</font>

611
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,113
<font color="yellow">did he mention who pushed the victim?</font>

612
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:38,643
<font color="yellow">He told me that information the morning after.</font>

613
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:41,813
<font color="yellow">That must mean that he had enough time to come up...</font>

614
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,113
<font color="yellow">with a new story.</font>

615
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:47,043
<font color="yellow">He told me he was hesitant to betray his friend.</font>

616
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:00,383
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

617
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:16,943
<font color="yellow">It's still pretty good for your first trial.</font>

618
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:18,283
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim.</font>

619
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:21,143
<font color="yellow">Don't act as if you're my superior.</font>

620
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:25,753
<font color="yellow">I'd like to call Kim Dong Hyun to testify as witness.</font>

621
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:30,443
<font color="yellow">Dong Hyun. Can you tell us what happened that night?</font>

622
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:36,413
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol told me he wanted to drop out of school...</font>

623
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,643
<font color="yellow">and wanted to show me something.</font>

624
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:41,413
<font color="yellow">He asked me to come to school at night,</font>

625
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:44,983
<font color="yellow">but I never imagined he would be stealing test papers.</font>

626
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,183
<font color="yellow">I thought he might beat me if I didn't go.</font>

627
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,253
<font color="yellow">I had no choice.</font>

628
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:54,413
<font color="yellow">Hey, it was your idea! You asked me to help!</font>

629
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:56,043
<font color="yellow">Hey. Tell them the truth.</font>

630
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,113
<font color="yellow">- You told me to do it. - No, you did.</font>

631
00:36:58,113 --> 00:36:59,983
<font color="yellow">This scum made me do it!</font>

632
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,413
<font color="yellow">He's the one who made me!</font>

633
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,183
<font color="yellow">- You better not lie. - Silence.</font>

634
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,283
<font color="yellow">- Silence! - Tell the truth.</font>

635
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,513
<font color="yellow">- You made me do it. - No, you did!</font>

636
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:08,513
<font color="yellow">Defendant, silence!</font>

637
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:12,613
<font color="yellow">How was the trial?</font>

638
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,383
<font color="yellow">It was a mess.</font>

639
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:18,913
<font color="yellow">There was some trouble during witness interrogation.</font>

640
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,513
<font color="yellow">I'll be taking over now.</font>

641
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,283
<font color="yellow">Did Joon Ho do something wrong?</font>

642
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:24,813
<font color="yellow">I'm not blaming him.</font>

643
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:27,253
<font color="yellow">He tried his best. He worked hard to prepare for it.</font>

644
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:30,283
<font color="yellow">I tried to help him as well,</font>

645
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:32,143
<font color="yellow">but it just didn't go well.</font>

646
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:35,143
<font color="yellow">Why would you help him? I sent him so you could crush him.</font>

647
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:38,013
<font color="yellow">It's your chance to show everyone that you're better than him.</font>

648
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:41,483
<font color="yellow">He only had settlement cases until now. This is his first trial.</font>

649
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:44,213
<font color="yellow">You can really shine in a case like this.</font>

650
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,543
<font color="yellow">That's why I sent Joon Ho.</font>

651
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:46,913
<font color="yellow">Show him what you got...</font>

652
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,683
<font color="yellow">while helping your client.</font>

653
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:49,983
<font color="yellow">What about Jae Yeol?</font>

654
00:37:50,713 --> 00:37:53,283
<font color="yellow">That boy will be sentenced for murder at such a young age.</font>

655
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:57,313
<font color="yellow">Do we want our political fight to add onto their mums' dispute?</font>

656
00:37:59,683 --> 00:38:03,213
<font color="yellow">I know you always try to solve things in a positive light,</font>

657
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:05,753
<font color="yellow">but do you think it'll be possible again this time?</font>

658
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,343
<font color="yellow">I should try at least.</font>

659
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:10,543
<font color="yellow">Nothing will change even if you put in so much effort.</font>

660
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:12,483
<font color="yellow">Joon Ho would never be thankful to you.</font>

661
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:14,753
<font color="yellow">No. Actually, he would hate it.</font>

662
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:16,383
<font color="yellow">You won't change your mind?</font>

663
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:21,183
<font color="yellow">Just ignore it. I'll see what I can do.</font>

664
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:23,613
<font color="yellow">I want to try.</font>

665
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:25,513
<font color="yellow">You should think for yourself...</font>

666
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:27,313
<font color="yellow">instead of others.</font>

667
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:28,813
<font color="yellow">You have to.</font>

668
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:31,413
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

669
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:33,413
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

670
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,583
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong.</font>

671
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:40,443
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you'll do well. Don't worry.</font>

672
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,343
<font color="yellow">Aren't you...</font>

673
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:09,483
<font color="yellow">Kang Seok Beom?</font>

674
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,643
<font color="yellow">Hello, Lawyer Kim.</font>

675
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,543
<font color="yellow">Hello. It's been a while.</font>

676
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:18,283
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>

677
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:20,783
<font color="yellow">I'm good.</font>

678
00:39:20,783 --> 00:39:22,813
<font color="yellow">Do you have business here?</font>

679
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:23,813
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

680
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:28,043
<font color="yellow">I brought my boss here. He's waiting inside.</font>

681
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:31,943
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

682
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:45,383
<font color="yellow">I heard that you know my driver.</font>

683
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:49,343
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor says on March 9 and 16 of last year, Lee Tae Joon...</font>

684
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:51,713
<font color="yellow">contacted President Cho Guk Hyun of Dokwang Development...</font>

685
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:54,343
<font color="yellow">and promised to give him the authority to build Dream UCT.</font>

686
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:55,883
<font color="yellow">Then he asked for money.</font>

687
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:58,383
<font color="yellow">My driver apparently has a close relationship with the prosecutor.</font>

688
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:00,983
<font color="yellow">When you see Prosecutor Lee,</font>

689
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,643
<font color="yellow">tell him my driver and I are worried about him.</font>

690
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:07,143
<font color="yellow">You didn't come to our meeting today.</font>

691
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:10,083
<font color="yellow">No. I had some personal business to attend.</font>

692
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:12,613
<font color="yellow">I belive President Seo Joong Won attended in my place.</font>

693
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:13,683
<font color="yellow">Was there a problem?</font>

694
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:15,643
<font color="yellow">No. No problem at all.</font>

695
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,253
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to ask you for a favour.</font>

696
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:25,943
<font color="yellow">I miss Prosecutor Lee.</font>

697
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:29,113
<font color="yellow">He keeps avoiding me so I can't set up a time.</font>

698
00:40:32,783 --> 00:40:34,253
<font color="yellow">Can you pass this to him for me?</font>

699
00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:36,543
<font color="yellow">Tell him it's herbal medicine from the driver.</font>

700
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:40,483
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go see him at home? He should be there.</font>

701
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,883
<font color="yellow">You know very well that I can't.</font>

702
00:40:44,213 --> 00:40:45,443
<font color="yellow">There are too many eyes around.</font>

703
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,613
<font color="yellow">Tell him this.</font>

704
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:50,143
<font color="yellow">I can't guarantee what will happen if he keeps avoiding me.</font>

705
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,251
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dan.</font>

706
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,781
<font color="yellow">They haven't found the test papers on the scene.</font>

707
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:33,051
<font color="yellow">Both kids claim that they never touched the papers.</font>

708
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,721
<font color="yellow">Of course the police cares more...</font>

709
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:37,481
<font color="yellow">about the homicide, so they're not so concerned about the papers.</font>

710
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:39,781
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask me to look into this?</font>

711
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:43,381
<font color="yellow">There was something that bothered me.</font>

712
00:41:43,621 --> 00:41:44,781
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

713
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,721
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

714
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:57,081
<font color="yellow">Yes. I need to find out something.</font>

715
00:41:57,721 --> 00:41:58,721
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to come?</font>

716
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:00,521
<font color="yellow">You can't go.</font>

717
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:03,321
<font color="yellow">You're only allowed at home, office and the hospital.</font>

718
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:08,281
<font color="yellow">It'll be quick.</font>

719
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:10,451
<font color="yellow">It's not like someone is watching me.</font>

720
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:12,081
<font color="yellow">They might be.</font>

721
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,721
<font color="yellow">Also, I'm going out to work. It's not for fun.</font>

722
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:15,821
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

723
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:17,881
<font color="yellow">I have a present for you in my room.</font>

724
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,621
<font color="yellow">It's from Cho Guk Hyun.</font>

725
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:21,151
<font color="yellow">Cho Guk Hyun?</font>

726
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:23,521
<font color="yellow">Did he say anything?</font>

727
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:27,021
<font color="yellow">He wants you to call him. He wants to see you badly.</font>

728
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:30,551
<font color="yellow">Right. Kang Seok Beom picked out the present.</font>

729
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,681
<font color="yellow">We haven't talked properly for a long time.</font>

730
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,521
<font color="yellow">We pretended to be happy instead of talking about important things.</font>

731
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,681
<font color="yellow">I think it's about time that we talked...</font>

732
00:42:43,081 --> 00:42:45,121
<font color="yellow">honestly without hiding anything.</font>

733
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:48,381
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

734
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:14,081
<font color="yellow">Long time no see.</font>

735
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:16,051
<font color="yellow">I have something to talk to you about.</font>

736
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:17,781
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

737
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:21,451
<font color="yellow">The police will start investigating on the theft of the test papers.</font>

738
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:27,881
<font color="yellow">Do you want one?</font>

739
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:42,981
<font color="yellow">When it happened to you, did you know...</font>

740
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:45,421
<font color="yellow">how happy the others were?</font>

741
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:47,251
<font color="yellow">Everyone disliked you and your husband...</font>

742
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:49,181
<font color="yellow">because both of you acted arrogantly.</font>

743
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:50,521
<font color="yellow">You especially...</font>

744
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,721
<font color="yellow">bossed people around and meddled in their businesses.</font>

745
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:56,221
<font color="yellow">Did you think that would last forever?</font>

746
00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:59,351
<font color="yellow">Things were going well for you for a while,</font>

747
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:02,721
<font color="yellow">but everything went down the gutter.</font>

748
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:06,351
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past.</font>

749
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:08,551
<font color="yellow">What's important now...</font>

750
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,451
<font color="yellow">is Dong Hyun.</font>

751
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:14,421
<font color="yellow">I know that what Dong Hyun did was terrible.</font>

752
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,921
<font color="yellow">No, why would he do that?</font>

753
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:20,251
<font color="yellow">He's different from Jae Yeol.</font>

754
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:22,081
<font color="yellow">He's a good student.</font>

755
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:24,451
<font color="yellow">He's always been a good son, too.</font>

756
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:25,721
<font color="yellow">His grades...</font>

757
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:27,721
<font color="yellow">are great as well.</font>

758
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:32,621
<font color="yellow">Didn't Dong Hyun ask you where the key to the cabinet was kept?</font>

759
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:35,051
<font color="yellow">You know because you're part of the management committee.</font>

760
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,981
<font color="yellow">"Did Dong Hyun steal the test papers?"</font>

761
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:40,921
<font color="yellow">"Did he kill someone by mistake?"</font>

762
00:44:41,621 --> 00:44:42,951
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you keep wondering.</font>

763
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:44,721
<font color="yellow">It was the same for me when the news broke out.</font>

764
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:45,821
<font color="yellow">Don't talk nonsense.</font>

765
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:49,581
<font color="yellow">Don't compare my son to your husband.</font>

766
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:51,051
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

767
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:54,381
<font color="yellow">Ask him to what extent is true. He can be helped only if he tells...</font>

768
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:55,681
<font color="yellow">I said, leave.</font>

769
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:58,451
<font color="yellow">Second chances are given only when we know the truth.</font>

770
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,321
<font color="yellow">There's nothing if you don't accept the truth.</font>

771
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:03,921
<font color="yellow">It's worse for both of us if we hide something from each other.</font>

772
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:08,081
<font color="yellow">- Hey... - Don't go!</font>

773
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:16,651
<font color="yellow">It took me too long to find out,</font>

774
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,881
<font color="yellow">but I hope you'll realise it sooner for your child.</font>

775
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:44,151
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dan. Can you unlock locked doors?</font>

776
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:52,751
<font color="yellow">I was so lucky today.</font>

777
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,981
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me suddenly?</font>

778
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:58,181
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

779
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,281
<font color="yellow">It's fine as long as you're thankful.</font>

780
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:05,151
<font color="yellow">You should take better care of me and listen to my advice.</font>

781
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:14,251
<font color="yellow">May I ask you a question?</font>

782
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:15,621
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

783
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:17,651
<font color="yellow">Why did my husband fire you?</font>

784
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:22,121
<font color="yellow">I was secretly investigating his case that he had closed.</font>

785
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,351
<font color="yellow">Was that the only reason?</font>

786
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:32,181
<font color="yellow">I exposed some information as well.</font>

787
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:35,551
<font color="yellow">I quit when he asked me if I wanted to quit or be punished.</font>

788
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:37,821
<font color="yellow">You should break up with him soon.</font>

789
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:46,421
<font color="yellow">Why are we here?</font>

790
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:51,321
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol said he ran away after seeing the security.</font>

791
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:55,621
<font color="yellow">Dong Hyun was caught while he was stealing the test papers.</font>

792
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,681
<font color="yellow">What if the murder took place because of that?</font>

793
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:01,521
<font color="yellow">The test papers.</font>

794
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:04,181
<font color="yellow">There must be Dong Hyun's fingerprints on the papers.</font>

795
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,621
<font color="yellow">Dong Hyun must have taken it.</font>

796
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:09,181
<font color="yellow">Knowing that the police would arrest him?</font>

797
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:10,721
<font color="yellow">He was probably too scared to do that.</font>

798
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:12,181
<font color="yellow">Then he must have thrown it away.</font>

799
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:14,051
<font color="yellow">Where? In a trash can?</font>

800
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:16,381
<font color="yellow">What if someone finds it?</font>

801
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:20,721
<font color="yellow">He said it took seven minutes for friends and the ambulance to arrive.</font>

802
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,381
<font color="yellow">He had to either throw it away or hide it during that time.</font>

803
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,351
<font color="yellow">What would you have done?</font>

804
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:29,281
<font color="yellow">I'd have eaten it.</font>

805
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:31,251
<font color="yellow">It's not hard to eat a few pieces of paper.</font>

806
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:34,051
<font color="yellow">It's hard for average people.</font>

807
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:36,221
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

808
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:40,451
<font color="yellow">I know what you're thinking.</font>

809
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:43,451
<font color="yellow">I met Dong Hyun here.</font>

810
00:47:44,121 --> 00:47:45,951
<font color="yellow">I was curious why he was at school.</font>

811
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:49,081
<font color="yellow">He came to retrieve the papers.</font>

812
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:50,451
<font color="yellow">Shall we open it?</font>

813
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,581
<font color="yellow">Dong Hyun's mum.</font>

814
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:26,881
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd come here to find it.</font>

815
00:48:27,181 --> 00:48:28,981
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

816
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:31,051
<font color="yellow">He killed someone even if it was by mistake.</font>

817
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:33,251
<font color="yellow">You can't solve it by trying to hide it.</font>

818
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:34,381
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

819
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:37,651
<font color="yellow">My child wouldn't do that.</font>

820
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:41,621
<font color="yellow">You should worry about your husband instead.</font>

821
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:43,281
<font color="yellow">Worry about your husband instead!</font>

822
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:44,721
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - Hey.</font>

823
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:46,651
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let me go!</font>

824
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:49,251
<font color="yellow">Worry about your husband!</font>

825
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:51,781
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let me go!</font>

826
00:48:51,981 --> 00:48:54,181
<font color="yellow">Hey. No! Don't do it!</font>

827
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:57,751
<font color="yellow">Don't do it! Dong Hyun didn't do it.</font>

828
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:01,151
<font color="yellow">He didn't do it. Please stop.</font>

829
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,721
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

830
00:49:03,451 --> 00:49:05,021
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

831
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:08,521
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

832
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:14,751
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol will be tried again at the juvenile court.</font>

833
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:17,551
<font color="yellow">It's not likely that he'll be sent to a juvenile hall.</font>

834
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:20,651
<font color="yellow">He'll serve community service or be under protective supervision.</font>

835
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:24,051
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Lee will help you with the rest.</font>

836
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,081
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Hye Gyeong.</font>

837
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:34,251
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

838
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:44,421
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

839
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:48,821
<font color="yellow">Once things go well with Jae Yeol,</font>

840
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:50,481
<font color="yellow">let's get along like before.</font>

841
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,421
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

842
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:55,551
<font color="yellow">How about lunch? I'll call you.</font>

843
00:49:55,821 --> 00:49:58,551
<font color="yellow">I know you won't call me or have lunch,</font>

844
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:01,451
<font color="yellow">but it's really okay.</font>

845
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,751
<font color="yellow">I understand you.</font>

846
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:12,851
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol's mum.</font>

847
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:15,721
<font color="yellow">Please save my child.</font>

848
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:18,151
<font color="yellow">My Dong Hyun...</font>

849
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:21,251
<font color="yellow">Say that he made a mistake.</font>

850
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:23,521
<font color="yellow">Please, I beg you.</font>

851
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,951
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

852
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:26,981
<font color="yellow">Please say it in court.</font>

853
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:28,881
<font color="yellow">Jae Yeol's mum.</font>

854
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:31,581
<font color="yellow">Please, I beg you to say...</font>

855
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:42,321
<font color="yellow">You did well.</font>

856
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,521
<font color="yellow">I thought I interacted with people honestly.</font>

857
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:52,221
<font color="yellow">It's not because I'm a good person. It just feels natural to me.</font>

858
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:54,581
<font color="yellow">But I didn't expect them to take it that way.</font>

859
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:57,021
<font color="yellow">I really didn't.</font>

860
00:50:58,081 --> 00:50:59,651
<font color="yellow">Was I wrong...</font>

861
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:02,121
<font color="yellow">or did I not understand them?</font>

862
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:06,751
<font color="yellow">I don't think they disliked you from the start.</font>

863
00:51:07,321 --> 00:51:09,651
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they liked you and were thankful at times.</font>

864
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,151
<font color="yellow">Then, when things started to get bad on your end,</font>

865
00:51:13,421 --> 00:51:15,281
<font color="yellow">they decided they disliked you from the start.</font>

866
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:17,721
<font color="yellow">What would they gain from that?</font>

867
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,121
<font color="yellow">Aren't the good times we spent more important?</font>

868
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:22,121
<font color="yellow">It was so that they wouldn't have to help you.</font>

869
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,851
<font color="yellow">They were making an excuse for themselves.</font>

870
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:27,581
<font color="yellow">It was their way...</font>

871
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,181
<font color="yellow">to forgive their cowardice.</font>

872
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:42,351
<font color="yellow">You're quite dull when it comes to things like this.</font>

873
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,451
<font color="yellow">Did you know I used to like you at Judicial Training Institute?</font>

874
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:47,421
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

875
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:49,921
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

876
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:51,151
<font color="yellow">You absolutely had no idea?</font>

877
00:51:51,721 --> 00:51:53,351
<font color="yellow">I thought it was quite obvious.</font>

878
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:56,581
<font color="yellow">You were very dull.</font>

879
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,981
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me? We hung out all the time.</font>

880
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:01,921
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure either.</font>

881
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:04,481
<font color="yellow">It was too late when I had realised it.</font>

882
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:07,951
<font color="yellow">I realised it when we were almost done with our training.</font>

883
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,251
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Lee.</font>

884
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:49,451
<font color="yellow">I've waited for so long.</font>

885
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:51,681
<font color="yellow">We'll talk on our own now.</font>

886
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:54,581
<font color="yellow">Keep my wife out of it.</font>

887
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:55,981
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

888
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,751
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim is a nice lady.</font>

889
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:02,151
<font color="yellow">What's the point of bringing up bad memories?</font>

890
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:06,651
<font color="yellow">That poor man Seok Beom still gambles.</font>

891
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:10,421
<font color="yellow">I helped him because you're close with him, but people misunderstand.</font>

892
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:13,051
<font color="yellow">It's so tiring.</font>

893
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:15,481
<font color="yellow">Especially Head Prosecutor Choi.</font>

894
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,351
<font color="yellow">He's grinding his teeth at us these days.</font>

895
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:20,781
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Lee.</font>

896
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:22,721
<font color="yellow">We must stick together.</font>

897
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,151
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to win.</font>

898
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:27,121
<font color="yellow">If we don't, he'll keep on poking at us.</font>

899
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:29,421
<font color="yellow">You know what he's like.</font>

900
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:32,521
<font color="yellow">To be honest, wasn't our business...</font>

901
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:34,981
<font color="yellow">pretty clean compared to what other people do?</font>

902
00:53:35,681 --> 00:53:37,321
<font color="yellow">It was clean enough to me.</font>

903
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:40,951
<font color="yellow">So why does he keep on trying to get dirt out of it?</font>

904
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,651
<font color="yellow">Just look at what he does.</font>

905
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:45,981
<font color="yellow">Isn't he more at wrong here?</font>

906
00:53:46,581 --> 00:53:50,021
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Lee. Let's partner up to beat him.</font>

907
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:52,221
<font color="yellow">Don't lie to me.</font>

908
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:54,551
<font color="yellow">I clearly remember your going on...</font>

909
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:58,281
<font color="yellow">blind dates with girls during our school days.</font>

910
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:01,821
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd just move on if you lied about the past?</font>

911
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,481
<font color="yellow">Can't you just accept things without picking at it?</font>

912
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:05,481
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

913
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,881
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can handle secrets or lies any more.</font>

914
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:10,151
<font color="yellow">I just want to know the truth.</font>

<font color="yellow">Even if the truth is ugly,</font>

916
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:14,881
<font color="yellow">I prefer to know about it than not.</font>

<font color="yellow">Wow, look at the time.</font>

920
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:32,721
<font color="yellow">I better go. What about you?</font>

921
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:34,621
<font color="yellow">I'll have another drink.</font>

922
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:36,821

<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.</font>

925
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:13,681
<font color="yellow">- What? - What is it? Do you know him?</font>

926
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:15,981
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's a gangster I'm trying to catch.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for it later.</font>

944

<font color="yellow">Please buy me some time.</font>

945
00:57:08,181 --> 00:57:09,921
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is the right thing to do?</font>

946
