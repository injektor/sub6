<font color="yellow">When you were inside the water a mermaid, and when you were on land you appeared to be human.</font>

149
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,260
<font color="yellow">And the tears that mermaid shed became pearls.</font>

150
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,930
<font color="yellow">I thought that being a nobleman in a past life at first didn't make sense either.</font>

151
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,590
<font color="yellow">I kept getting a strange thought.</font>

152
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,490
<font color="yellow">Well, if I threw you</font>

153
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,840
<font color="yellow">into that water.</font>

154
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,610
<font color="yellow">It would confirm it.</font>

155
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,480
<font color="yellow">They say that there isn't a car that's been caught in the inspections yet.</font>

156
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
<font color="yellow">Until when do we have to keep going?</font>

157
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,180
<font color="yellow">Detective Jang. Isn't this the way to that hospital in Ma Dae Young's treatment records?</font>

158
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

159
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,950
<font color="yellow">But that hospital was closed down the year before last.</font>

160
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,560
<font color="yellow">That's true. That's why we struggled so much in finding those hospital treatment records.</font>

161
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,890
<font color="yellow">- Go to the hospital. <br> - We're going there right now.</font>

162
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,040
<font color="yellow">Don't keep ordering us around.</font>

163
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,910
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go.</font>

164
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, Heo Joon Jae!</font>

165
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Operating Room<br> Restricted Area </i></font>

166
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,250
<font color="yellow">Cheong. Cheong.</font>

167
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,980
<font color="yellow">I don't know what kind of dream it was</font>

168
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,900
<font color="yellow">but if I was a mermaid in it, did I give you a warning of some sort?</font>

169
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,760
<font color="yellow">A mermaid doesn't leave alone a human who has touched her body.</font>

170
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,790
<font color="yellow">A mermaid can erase whatever memories she wishes.</font>

171
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,720
<font color="yellow"><i>Be careful Sir. If you mistakenly touch a mermaid</i></font>

172
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,450
<font color="yellow"><i>they say the mermaid will take your soul and erase your memories.</i></font>

173
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,820
<font color="yellow"><i>I heard this is the way that the mermaids have to protect themselves from humans.</i></font>

174
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,280
<font color="yellow"><i>Whatever you want to decide is the price.</i></font>

175
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Would it even compare to a hundred roots of wild mountain ginseng?</i></font>

176
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,270
<font color="yellow"><i>I heard that the quality of oil that's collected from a mermaid</i></font>

177
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,470
<font color="yellow"><i>is unbelievable. </i></font>

178
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,520
<font color="yellow"><i>I will definitely make that mermaid mine again.</i></font>

179
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,130
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm going to kill that immature official fellow by own hand. </i></font>

180
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Until she dies I'm going beat the tears out of her drop by drop.</i></font>

181
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,160
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm thinking to spread the pearls on the path you</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>walk upon.<br> - A foolish love </i></font>

183
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,100
<font color="yellow"><i>makes me so happy. <br> - Die.</i></font>

184
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,760
<font color="yellow"><i>And don't be born again. </i></font>

185
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Among the fishermen, there was one who put his hands on a mermaid</i></font>

186
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,190
<font color="yellow"><i>and I heard he went insane. </i></font>

187
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,310
<font color="yellow">The moment you put your hands on me</font>

188
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,860
<font color="yellow">you will lose all of your memories.</font>

189
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,300
<font color="yellow">That is the way in which a mermaid can protect herself from humans.</font>

190
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,260
<font color="yellow">Confirm it.</font>

191
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Heo Joon Hae. I'm scared.</i></font>

192
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry</font>

193
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,630
<font color="yellow">that I came so late.</font>

194
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

195
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,800
<font color="yellow">Aish! Ma Dae Yound, you bastard. Where did you go?</font>

196
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,790
<font color="yellow">Requesting back up support.</font>

197
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,110
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, did you see the news?</font>

198
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,600
<font color="yellow">There's a huge commotion going on right now in Seoul with searches and inspection checkpoints to catch Ma Dae Young.</font>

199
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,800
<font color="yellow">Hey, and you know who the detective in charge of Ma Dae Young is?</font>

200
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,280
<font color="yellow">Don't be shocked, okay? That Mi Mi Hong Dong Pyo.</font>

201
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,590
<font color="yellow">I think I'm that Mi Mi Hong Dong Pyo.</font>

202
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,110
<font color="yellow">What's the Mi Mi stand for?</font>

203
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,130
<font color="yellow">Michin Misery (crazy miserable).</font>

204
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,750
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

205
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,710
<font color="yellow">Sit down since you're here.</font>

206
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,910
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

207
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,260
<font color="yellow">I... From before, if I ever met you</font>

208
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,380
<font color="yellow">I always wanted to tell you.</font>

209
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,670
<font color="yellow">When I die I'm thinking to donate everything I have to society.</font>

210
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,990
<font color="yellow">Are you going to take us in?</font>

211
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,620
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae. That person earlier...</font>

212
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,420
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about it later. You had a hard time today.</font>

213
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,340
<font color="yellow">Don't think about that and don't worry.</font>

214
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,860
<font color="yellow">Today sleep here deeply. I'll sleep up in the attic room.</font>

215
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,420
<font color="yellow">They say you suffer when you leave home. It's so nice to come home.</font>

216
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,900
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

217
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,960
<font color="yellow">So don't go out so recklessly and just keep staying here.</font>

218
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,120
<font color="yellow">- Forever? <br> - You can't forever.</font>

219
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,360
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

220
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,490
<font color="yellow">This is a long term deposit lease ending in two years.</font>

221
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,330
<font color="yellow">There's a lot left though, about a year and a half?</font>

222
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,610
<font color="yellow">- Long term deposit lease?</font>

223
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,400
<font color="yellow">In truth, I'm saying this house isn't mine.</font>

224
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,630
<font color="yellow">What's mine is only this furniture and baggage.</font>

225
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,800
<font color="yellow">Later we have to move all of it.</font>

226
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,070
<font color="yellow">- Move all of it? <br> - Yeah.</font>

227
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,830
<font color="yellow">- Who? <br> - You have to move all of it.</font>

228
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,980
<font color="yellow">Since you're going to go with me.</font>

229
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,400
<font color="yellow">Together?</font>

230
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,030
<font color="yellow">Go on and sleep. I have some more things to discuss with the person outside.</font>

231
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,130
<font color="yellow">To be frank, I should ask the woman inside over there a few things.</font>

232
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,900
<font color="yellow">You can't because she's really in shock.</font>

233
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,980
<font color="yellow">And with regards to Ma Dae Young I know more than her so ask me instead.</font>

234
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,600
<font color="yellow">If Ma Dae Young attempted to take that woman there should be a reason.</font>

235
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,980
<font color="yellow">I told you. It's me.</font>

236
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,660
<font color="yellow">Tae Oh, show them Mae Dae Young's security cam footage.</font>

237
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,100
<font color="yellow">Look, isn't it from that day that that loan shark died?</font>

238
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,220
<font color="yellow">It is. I was right.</font>

239
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,440
<font color="yellow">He came to that house wearing that. Not long ago he</font>

240
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
<font color="yellow"><i> Joon Jae. Shortly after 7 p.m. at 29-21 Banji in Yeonjoong-dong, I'll see you. I'll be waiting.</i></font>

241
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,890
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

242
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,090
<font color="yellow">It's an ajusshi that I'm close with, but after his DUI incident he's been in a coma.</font>

243
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,550
<font color="yellow">Then I received such a text message.</font>

244
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,160
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae went out because of that text and almost died.</font>

245
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,700
<font color="yellow">It was disguised as an accident and it probably means Ma Dae Young is somehow involved.</font>

246
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,370
<font color="yellow">Have you ever scammed Ma Dae Young himself or his acquaintances?</font>

247
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,420
<font color="yellow">No</font>

248
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,350
<font color="yellow">Let's not be so confident. You never know.</font>

249
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:53,110
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Ma Dae Young is one thing and you all are--</font>

250
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,960
<font color="yellow">But then, it won't be easy to put us in for fraud.</font>

251
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,590
<font color="yellow">None of the victims have ever reported anything.</font>

252
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,500
<font color="yellow">They probably can't because it's all money that wasn't clean anyway.</font>

253
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,540
<font color="yellow">Is it not a crime if they can't report it?</font>

254
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,020
<font color="yellow">And you, you always go somewhere pretending to be me.</font>

255
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,330
<font color="yellow">It isn't like I pretended to be a police detective and embezzled.</font>

256
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,920
<font color="yellow">I never injured anyone.</font>

257
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,590
<font color="yellow">As for impersonating a public servant, don't I only need to pay a fine?</font>

258
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,970
<font color="yellow">This thing really. If at least he couldn't be so eloquent.</font>

259
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,400
<font color="yellow">Let's first catch that crazy bastard Ma Dae Young. I'll help.</font>

260
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,040
<font color="yellow">Does he get caught because you said something?</font>

261
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,620
<font color="yellow">I was planning on catching him from the beginning.</font>

262
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,060
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about the problem we have between us after catching Ma Dae Young.</font>

263
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,140
<font color="yellow">After that I'll do as you ask Detective.</font>

264
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,460
<font color="yellow">- On what? Do I take you on your word? <br> - I even let you know where I live!</font>

265
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,350
<font color="yellow">Now that I have a lot to lose I can't go running away anywhere I please anymore.</font>

266
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,720
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't believe me, just do so. Just for today could you please just go?</font>

267
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,620
<font color="yellow"><i>You can move it all later.</i></font>

268
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Someone will move all of these? Who will?</i></font>

269
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,180
<font color="yellow"><i>You need to move all of them since you'll be going with me.</i></font>

270
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,610
<font color="yellow"><i>What does it mean to move a "yearly deposit home" together?</i></font>

271
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,590
<font color="yellow"><i>Does that mean let's get married? No that's not it.</i></font>

272
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,560
<font color="yellow"><i>It didn't seem like he was saying let's get married.</i></font>

273
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,740
<font color="yellow"><i>He told me that I have to move all the stuff.</i></font>

274
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,830
<font color="yellow"><i>Did he perhaps need me so I could move all the furniture?</i></font>

275
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,870
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's what that meant?</font>

276
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,460
<font color="yellow">Idiot.</font>

277
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,970
<font color="yellow"><i>Does he mean he'll marry someone else and expects me to move the furniture?</i></font>

278
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,680
<font color="yellow">No, I don't mean that. That's not it.</font>

279
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,050
<font color="yellow"><i> - But then... </i><br> - But then?</font>

280
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,850
<font color="yellow">"But then" what? What then?</font>

281
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,850
<font color="yellow"><i>why did he touch my hair?</i></font>

282
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,410
<font color="yellow"><i>He definitely lovingly fluffed it.</i></font>

283
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,050
<font color="yellow">So cute.</font>

284
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Heo Joon Jae maybe it's not that he only plans to like me but does he already like (me)--</i></font>

285
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Has he fallen deeply for?</i></font>

286
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this the start of romantic love?</i></font>

287
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,410
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh no! Oh my god! What do I do!</i></font>

288
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,990
<font color="yellow"><i>No...for him to like me, he bickers too much.</i></font>

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,150

<font color="yellow">Hey! Let's go to sleep! Please!</font>

293
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,130
<font color="yellow">What, Heo Joon Jae?</font>

294
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,880
<font color="yellow">- You're not asleep yet? <br> - Yeah I'll go to sleep.</font>

295
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,010
<font color="yellow">Why don't you hurry off to sleep since you're tired.</font>

296
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,960
<font color="yellow">Don't do things like thinking too much. You have to sleep deeply.</font>

297
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,120
<font color="yellow">That way you can wake up early and watch the morning soaps you love so much.</font>

298
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,970
<font color="yellow">Ok. Good night.</font>

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,930
<font color="yellow">Ok, good night.

<font color="yellow">Please don't. Stop. <br> <i>- No that's not it. He said, "good night" and smiled at me.</i><br> - Please!</font>

303
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,370
<font color="yellow"><i>What's the significance of his smile?</i></font>

00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,570
<font color="yellow">I think things will still take some time on this side.</font>

310
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,840
<font color="yellow">Because they're on a different level.</font>

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,600
<font color="yellow">We should once again try on Chairman Heo's front. Right?</font>

316
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,910
<font color="yellow">Hello Madam, you've been doing well right?</font>

317
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,790
<font color="yellow">Oh Madam, we need to have a</font>

318
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,340
<font color="yellow">Shall we then?</font>

319
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,730
<font color="yellow">Yeah around 7. I'll see you there. Okay.</font>

320
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,760
<font color="yellow">Did the two of you not sleep well? Your faces look so haggard.</font>

321
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,560
<font color="yellow">Yeah, because I had a lot to think about.</font>

322
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,220
<font color="yellow">Yeah, because she had stuff to think about.</font>

323
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

324
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:58,390
<font color="yellow">Because she was moving around, I couldn't sleep well.</font>

325
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,630
<font color="yellow">- I moved around?<br> - Yeah. A lot.</font>

327
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,080
<font color="yellow"><i> Did he start to dislike me in the span of one night?</i></font>

328
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,240
<font color="yellow"><i>What did I do? He told me let's move a "yearly-loan house" together and was even green. Why's he mad?</i></font>

329
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
<font color="yellow">No! It's not!</font>

330
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:25,240
<font color="yellow">It's that now that I think about it. It didn't seem like you were being particularly noisy when you moved around.</font>

331
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,940
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

332
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,050
<font color="yellow">Hyung, shall we go out today and buy a tree?</font>

333
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,620
<font color="yellow">- A Christmas tree? <br> - I want to go! I want to go too.</font>

<font color="yellow">No, you stay home.</font>

335
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,980
<font color="yellow">I will go with Hyung Nam Doo and Tae Oh. The three of us will go,</font>

336
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,050
<font color="yellow">so you stay home. By yourself.</font>

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,290
<font color="yellow"><i>You want me to be by myself?</i></font>

338
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,480
<font color="yellow">Stay home alone.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>I'm telling you to go inside the water you like.</i></font>

340
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,370
<font color="yellow"><i>Why is he saying I should stay home alone?</i></font>

341
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,230
<font color="yellow"><i>Is it that he's telling me to in torment by myself?</i></font>

342
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Why? Just why?</i></font>

343
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,080
<font color="yellow">No. That's not it.</font>

344
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,800
<font color="yellow">As you live with three guys,</font>

345
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,720
<font color="yellow">there might be things you can't do.</font>

346
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,930
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

347
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,440
<font color="yellow">Yeah. So do those.</font>

348
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,430
<font color="yellow">For us, 7 o'clock. We won't be back at the house before 7,</font>

349
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,690
<font color="yellow">so until then, you stay in this house alone.</font>

350
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,960
<font color="yellow">So do the things you want. Do that.</font>

351
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,090
<font color="yellow">Think you're the house owner.</font>

352
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,420
<font color="yellow"><i>Is he telling me to clean? That I should think I'm the house owner and clean?</i></font>

353
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,520
<font color="yellow">No, cleaning, chores, not those kinds of things!</font>

354
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,060
<font color="yellow">The thing you can do to relax most comfortably.</font>

355
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,590
<font color="yellow">Do those kinds of things!</font>

356
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,540
<font color="yellow">-What are you doing?<br>-Hey, that looks like it hurts. Why are you pinching her cheeks like that?</font>

357
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,900
<font color="yellow">Weirdly, I want to.</font>

358
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Why is my face so hot? Is it hot because he pinched it?</i></font>

359
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,240
<font color="yellow"><i>No? It's hot even without pinching.</i></font>

360
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,650
<font color="yellow"><i>What's with me?</i></font>

361
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,950
<font color="yellow">Then let's buy a tree,</font>

362
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,890
<font color="yellow">a wine, and some things to eat, and have a simple Christmas party.</font>

363
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,360
<font color="yellow">-Invite Si Ah too.<br>-Sure.</font>

364
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,050
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then I'll come out after I get ready. Let's head out after 10 minutes.</font>

365
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,990
<font color="yellow"><i>This hurts a lot. For some weird reason, I like it.</i></font>

366
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,400
<font color="yellow"><i>What is this feeling? Am I going crazy?</i></font>

367
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't be the only one feeling something good like this. I want Heo Joon Jae to feel this too.</i></font>

368
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</font>

369
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,720
<font color="yellow">When you're alone,</font>

370
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,500
<font color="yellow">do what you want. For sure.</font>

371
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,190
<font color="yellow"><i>What's this now?</i></font>

372
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,590
<font color="yellow"><i>I couldn't think of anything for a short while.</i></font>

373
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,840
<font color="yellow"><i>What does this mean? What's the meaning of this?</i></font>

374
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,430
<font color="yellow"><i>What does he think about me? What is it? Does he like me or what?</i></font>

375
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,600
<font color="yellow"><i>What happened? What's the meaning of this? What happened?</i></font>

376
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,500
<font color="yellow">Two of the friends said they would be the witnesses.</font>

377
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,440
<font color="yellow">That neither has a conflict of interest in the matter of being entrusted with the task</font>

378
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,670
<font color="yellow">has been confirmed through the paperwork you have sent in advance.</font>

379
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,240
<font color="yellow">But, Sir,</font>

380
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,550
<font color="yellow">what is the reason for rushing the making of your formal will.</font>

381
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,290
<font color="yellow">About my son Joon Jae.</font>

382
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,930
<font color="yellow">I want to give him all of my fortune.</font>

383
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,930
<font color="yellow">Whether it's stocks, real estates, international assets, whatever it is.</font>

384
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,300
<font color="yellow">You're saying everything?</font>

385
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,340
<font color="yellow">Everything that I can within the limits.</font>

386
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,970
<font color="yellow">But, Sir, the current wife</font>

387
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,440
<font color="yellow">and Heo Chi Hoon need to receive at least the legally reserved amount of inheritance.</font>

388
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,640
<font color="yellow">That way, there won't be inheritance lawsuit problem later.</font>

389
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,330
<font color="yellow">If I exclude those,</font>

390
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,370
<font color="yellow">how much inheritance will Joon Jae possibly receive?</font>

391
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,700
<font color="yellow">He can receive at most 9/14.</font>

392
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,910
<font color="yellow">You must be busy during the year end holiday season.</font>

393
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you for giving up this time.</font>

394
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,330
<font color="yellow">Nah, I'll pay today.</font>

395
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,830
<font color="yellow">We only ever ate good things from you guys.</font>

396
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,190
<font color="yellow">No, no. I'll pay.</font>

397
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,130
<font color="yellow">Would you like some Chinese wine (白干兒)?</font>

398
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,780
<font color="yellow">Sounds good.</font>

399
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,580
<font color="yellow">Please take some.</font>

400
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,700
<font color="yellow">For me, too.</font>

401
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,760
<font color="yellow">Madam, let's do a cheers.</font>

416
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,630
<font color="yellow">You're old! So you're an unnie.</font>

417

<font color="yellow">Jin Joo. You're very drunk.</font>

419
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,150

424
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,600
<font color="yellow">You received all those and now you ignore me?</font>

425
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,730
<font color="yellow">Do you just "eat and run"?!</font>

426
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,330
<font color="yellow">If you take it everyday, you should know how to give some times, seriously!</font>

427

<font color="yellow">Why are you playing hard to get? Huh?</font>

428

432
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,440
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

433
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,120
<font color="yellow">Listen to me, okay?</font>

434
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,810
<font color="yellow">Are you going to include us or not?</font>

435
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,530
<font color="yellow">Somber up and come out carefully.</font>

436
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,470
<font color="yellow">Since she is so mean like this, she seduced her high school classmate's husband. Geesh!</font>

437
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,160
<font color="yellow">What? What did you just say?</font>

438
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,110
<font color="yellow">I read everything in Gangnam Tabloid!</font>

439
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,950
<font color="yellow">You stole your high school friend's husband.</font>

440
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,830
<font color="yellow">That friend went missing, and their son got thrown out.</font>

441
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:43,700
<font color="yellow">It says you've completely ruined that family.</font>

442
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,490
<font color="yellow">Wow, seriously!</font>

443
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,630
<font color="yellow">You really are something else, eh?!</font>

444
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,220
<font color="yellow">Amazing.</font>

445
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,090
<font color="yellow">Wait, what's going on? Why isn't our Cheong coming out?</font>

446
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,710
<font color="yellow"><i>Are these clothes better? No. Heo Joon Jae doesn't like short things.</i></font>

447
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,980
<font color="yellow"><i>This is long. No, no. This is too hot.</i></font>

448
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,150
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be hot.</font>

449
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,360
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this moderate?</i></font>

450
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,670
<font color="yellow"><i>I need to look prettier than Cha Si Ah.</i></font>

451
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,080
<font color="yellow">Wow, today you're Party Cheong, Party Cheong.</font>

452
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,170
<font color="yellow">Wow, pretty!</font>

453
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,370
<font color="yellow">Come over here.</font>

454
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,910
<font color="yellow"><i>I told you not to take a picture, didn't I?</i></font>

455
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,960
<font color="yellow"><i>This rascal. I told you! Come over here.</i></font>

456
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Come over here!</i></font>

457
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,850
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking, Dog Nam Doo.</font>

458
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,700
<font color="yellow">Merry Christmas.</font>

459
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,770
<font color="yellow">I want to try too.</font>

460
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,250
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

461
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,750
<font color="yellow">Wow, there's nothing Cheong can't do.</font>

462
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,060
<font color="yellow">I want to do it again.</font>

463
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,740
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>

464
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:39,150
<font color="yellow">I can't really do it, Joon Jae. You hold this and...?</font>

465
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,560
<font color="yellow">You just put this here and you hit right here.</font>

466
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Why am I uselessly doing this well?</i></font>

467
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Because I'm already doing this well, Heo Joon Jae can't teach me.</i></font>

468
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,630
<font color="yellow"><i>Why am I so good at this?</i></font>

469
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,830
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if I try to stop, I can't. The snack is too good.</i></font>

470
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,880
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't laugh and teach me correctly.</font>

471
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,430
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

472
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,930
<font color="yellow">You came again?</font>

473
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,370
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Cha Si Ah.</font>

474
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,240
<font color="yellow">This is my house, so I go outside and come back.</font>

475
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,860
<font color="yellow">Of course I'll have to move with him when Heo Joon Jae moves his lease after a year and a half.</font>

476
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,330
<font color="yellow">What? Are you marrying Heo Joon Jae?</font>

477
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,630
<font color="yellow">Although we didn't say it was a definite thing,</font>

478
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,080
<font color="yellow">we did say there was a plan like that between us.</font>

479
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,260
<font color="yellow">Plan? What plan?</font>

480
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,500
<font color="yellow">The plan for Heo Joon Jae to like me.</font>

481
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,960
<font color="yellow">-Joon Jae said that?<br>-Yeah.</font>

482
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,930
<font color="yellow">Looks like Joon Jae did it again. He says that a lot.</font>

483
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,100
<font color="yellow">-What?<br>-You're always saying this inside, right?</font>

484
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,520
<font color="yellow">"Oh? Does he like me? His gaze is a gaze that he likes me."</font>

485
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,850
<font color="yellow">"Is it not? Is he only treating me well?"</font>

486
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,690
<font color="yellow">But what does he mean by him having a plan to like her?</font>

487
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,660
<font color="yellow">"Does he like me?"</font>

488
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,930
<font color="yellow">"But why hasn't he said to date him? Does he not like me?"</font>

489
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,630
<font color="yellow">Can you hear something from inside?</font>

490
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,920
<font color="yellow">Not that I can hear anything,</font>

491
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,700
<font color="yellow">this is called "managing the aquarium." <br><i>(Managing several potential suitors)<i></i></i></font>

492
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,020
<font color="yellow">Managing the aquarium?</font>

493
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,590
<font color="yellow">They throw out the bait and then keep them inside the net,</font>

494
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,270
<font color="yellow">and then having them keep high expectation.</font>

495
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,130
<font color="yellow">You can't handle Joon Jae.</font>

496
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,590
<font color="yellow">I am capable of not being swept by it and can stay by Joon Jae.</font>

497
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,490
<font color="yellow">That's exactly what you are. A fish captured inside an aquarium.</font>

498
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,750
<font color="yellow">I'm not a fish.</font>

499
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,440
<font color="yellow">No. You're a fish.</font>

500
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,460
<font color="yellow">It's enough that you were here for this long. Now go back to where you lived before</font>

501
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,820
<font color="yellow">whether it's a river or an ocean.</font>

502
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,420
<font color="yellow">Pick up.</font>

503
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,850
<font color="yellow"><i>The phone cannot be reached.</i></font>

504
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,550
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

505
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,920
<font color="yellow">Chi Hyeon.</font>

506
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,530
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you have something to say?</font>

507
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,950
<font color="yellow">Who's my father?</font>

508
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh,</font>

509
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,480
<font color="yellow">your father is sleeping in the master bedroom now.</font>

510
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,530
<font color="yellow">My biological father.</font>

511
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,990
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you suddenly become curious?</font>

512
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,500
<font color="yellow">I was always curious, just couldn't ask you, is all.</font>

513
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,620
<font color="yellow">Hey Chi Hyeon,</font>

514
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,420
<font color="yellow">Your real father is loving you</font>

515
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,980
<font color="yellow">in his own method. He knows well that not appearing in front of you,</font>

516
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,390
<font color="yellow">and you not knowing him are</font>

517
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,960
<font color="yellow">the things that would make you happy, hence isn't making an appearance.</font>

518
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,140
<font color="yellow">So you don't have to know that. Okay?</font>

519
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,070
<font color="yellow">The fact that you have to know is the fact that the only<br>people trustworthy in this world</font>

520
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:39,000
<font color="yellow">are you and me, only the two of us.</font>

521
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,930
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother.</font>

522
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,260
<font color="yellow">It seems to be true.</font>

523
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,040
<font color="yellow">It really seems to be true.</font>

524
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,600
<font color="yellow">Is that you? Come and have a seat.</font>

525
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,530
<font color="yellow">Why, Noona (elder sister)?</font>

526
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,440
<font color="yellow">Come have a drink.</font>

527
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,730
<font color="yellow">What's this for?</font>

528
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,550
<font color="yellow">Silly kid. If you wanted to have a picture of me, all you had to do was ask.</font>

529
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,290
<font color="yellow">Why would you take a picture secretly in such a crowded place?</font>

530
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,130
<font color="yellow">Noona, that earlier isn't what you're thinking, but...</font>

531
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,420
<font color="yellow">Don't bother explaining. Makes you appear unseemly.</font>

532
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,900
<font color="yellow">I told you. Though I can't accept your feelings,</font>

533
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,190
<font color="yellow">but don't look down on your love.</font>

534
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,350
<font color="yellow">Don't do things in hiding, but instead fess up to me of your pain.</font>

535
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,150
<font color="yellow">I'm not in pain. I'm saying this because I'm really not hurting.</font>

536
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,640
<font color="yellow">Listen well, Tae Ho. It's been 7 years for me.</font>

537
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,270
<font color="yellow">From the first day of my college entrance when I saw Joon Jae, and from then for the 7 following years,</font>

538
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,140
<font color="yellow">I've been watching from a far and maintained this type of relationship</font>

539
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,450
<font color="yellow">continuously. Why do you suppose that is?</font>

540
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,640
<font color="yellow">You're curious, right?</font>

541
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,340
<font color="yellow">It's because I didn't let on.</font>

542
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,190
<font color="yellow">Without burdening the object of your interest to remain neat & clean.</font>

543
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,590
<font color="yellow">While maintaining the appropriate distance.</font>

544
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you think the mature person's love</font>

545
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,210
<font color="yellow">would be something like that?</font>

546
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,080
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, do-o-o-n't hang up.</font>

547
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,140
<font color="yellow">Are you guys the only people with a plan?</font>

548
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,930
<font color="yellow">For me, I won't do the engagement party with you Joon Jae,</font>

549
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,120
<font color="yellow">but go straight to getting married.</font>

550
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,400
<font color="yellow">You know that's trendy these days.</font>

551
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,450
<font color="yellow">I'm gonna do exactly that.</font>

552
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:21,760
<font color="yellow">Either on the Jeju island Ol Leh trail or buckwheat field in Gang Won Province</font>

553
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,990
<font color="yellow">hang up an iron cauldron...</font>

554
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,930
<font color="yellow">That's what I'll be doing there.</font>

555
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,360
<font color="yellow">When we deliver a baby, I won't do the 100th day ceremony,<br>but give a charitable donation to UNICEF.</font>

556
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,840
<font color="yellow">That's right now... That's now very much...</font>

557
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,700
<font color="yellow">trendy.</font>

558
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,170
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae! Joon Jae, don't hang up.</font>

559
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,060
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

560
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,030
<font color="yellow">what is it that I've done so far, huh?</font>

561
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,620
<font color="yellow">Have I been making porridge to serve the dog? (wasted time and energy)</font>

562
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,090
<font color="yellow">Is that I've been doing?</font>

563
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,820
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae! Joon Jae!!</font>

564
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,320
<font color="yellow">If you get so loud in the middle of the street, the police will be called.</font>

565
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,460
<font color="yellow">Quickly go home.</font>

566
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,720
<font color="yellow">Who are you with? Tae Ho?</font>

567
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,460
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Jae!</i></font>

568
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,560
<font color="yellow">Ask Tae Ho to take you home. I'm really going to hang up now.</font>

569
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,750
<font color="yellow">The end of the year did come I guess, seeing how Cha Si Ah<br>is placing a drunk call.</font>

570
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,170
<font color="yellow">She seems to hold it in well until the end of the year when she does that once.</font>

571
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,180
<font color="yellow">Why...are you here in that posture?</font>

572
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,480
<font color="yellow">Get on up to your room now.</font>

573
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,790
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

574
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,780
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, are you seeing me as a fish?</font>

575
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,560
<font color="yellow">Are you regulating your fish-farm? (managing many <i>potential suitors)</i></font>

576
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,610
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to go up?</font>

577

644
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:50,940
<font color="yellow">At least it's the outside hardwear that's hurt, so we can do a surgery.</font>
