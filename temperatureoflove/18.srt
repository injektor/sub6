00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:08,526
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 18)</font>

2
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,391
<font color=#FFFF00>(Producer Kim "Star's Favorite Dish")</font>

3
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:16,931
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Producer Kim.</font>

4
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:18,562
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Park,</font>

5
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:22,262
<font color=#FFFF00>Apparently Chef On told us he won't be on the show anymore.</font>

6
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:25,731
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you changing your attitude too quickly?</font>

7
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:28,542
<font color=#FFFF00>It hasn't been long since you asked me desperately to let him on.</font>

8
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:30,942
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll look into it.</font>

9
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:32,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure he's on this episode.</font>

10
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:42,281
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a 6pm dinner appointment with CP Yoo at Good Soup.</font>

11
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:45,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Call Writer Ji Hong Ah to come if she's available.</font>

12
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,061
<font color=#FFFF00>And Director Min too.</font>

13
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:03,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Have we met before?</font>

14
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,641
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I've seen you before.</font>

15
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we met five years ago in Yeonnam-dong.</font>

16
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:12,311
<font color=#FFFF00>You had Kenya Double A then.</font>

17
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:14,481
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a good memory.</font>

18
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:17,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I talk to you comfortably?</font>

19
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:24,061
<font color=#FFFF00>You seem much older than my son.</font>

20
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:25,391
<font color=#FFFF00>How much older are you?</font>

21
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:28,762
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not that older.</font>

22
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm six years older.</font>

23
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:33,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Only six years?</font>

24
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Six years is nothing.</font>

25
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:40,941
<font color=#FFFF00>After I ended things with Jung Sun's dad, I only met younger men.</font>

26
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:43,581
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't go back to older guys after seeing younger men.</font>

27
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:47,421
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether they are older or younger, men are children.</font>

28
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:49,751
<font color=#FFFF00>It's better to humor younger men.</font>

29
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:52,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

30
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,122
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you do?</font>

31
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,292
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a drama writer.</font>

32
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,262
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm preparing for a new project right now.</font>

33
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:04,402
<font color=#FFFF00>When it's not on air, I'm basically unemployed.</font>

34
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I like that you don't show off.</font>

35
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:13,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you in touch with Chef On when he was in France?</font>

36
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,841
<font color=#FFFF00>No, we reconnected when he came back.</font>

37
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:19,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Right? There's no way I wouldn't have known if you were in touch.</font>

38
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:21,881
<font color=#FFFF00>What do your parents do?</font>

39
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,191
<font color=#FFFF00>They're both elementary school teachers.</font>

40
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,321
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nice.</font>

41
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:30,791
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like they'll be young at heart like elementary school kids.</font>

42
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:33,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, they are innocent.</font>

43
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:38,971
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's share phone numbers and be friends.</font>

44
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to get going.</font>

45
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going too then.</font>

46
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:47,781
<font color=#FFFF00>There's someone you should meet before you leave.</font>

47
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,341
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my fianc√©.</font>

48
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Soo Jung.</font>

49
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:59,251
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I get another glass? - Sure.</font>

50
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:05,992
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor Min.</font>

51
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:09,131
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Chef On's girlfriend.</font>

52
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:10,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

53
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:11,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, are you?</font>

54
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:14,172
<font color=#FFFF00>When did he get a girlfriend? He didn't have one before.</font>

55
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:18,642
<font color=#FFFF00>They've had a platonic love relationship for a while now.</font>

56
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:21,381
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a drama writer.</font>

57
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:22,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you're a writer?</font>

58
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:24,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a writer too.</font>

59
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:26,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm basically unemployed now.</font>

60
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,992
<font color=#FFFF00>She's so humble.</font>

61
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,851
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not good to be so humble.</font>

62
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,922
<font color=#FFFF00>She's older than Chef On.</font>

63
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:36,691
<font color=#FFFF00>It's less than our age gap though.</font>

64
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,601
<font color=#FFFF00>I like that she's older than my son.</font>

65
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:43,161
<font color=#FFFF00>Chef On and I are indeed similar.</font>

66
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Right, have a seat. Let's eat together.</font>

67
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:48,142
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's okay. I have some work to do.</font>

68
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,541
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going then, Mother.</font>

69
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother?</font>

70
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:56,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my, it feels so strange to hear that.</font>

71
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:58,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I not call you that?</font>

72
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,482
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not that I don't like it.</font>

73
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Then see you later.</font>

74
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

75
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:24,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Park.</font>

76
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. Where are you headed?</font>

77
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:29,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Home.</font>

78
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's walk together.</font>

79
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:09,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she even real?</font>

80
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,722
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen you with a woman.</font>

81
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:12,592
<font color=#FFFF00>Just get ready to greet her.</font>

82
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,862
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll look forward to it.</font>

83
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:34,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Go in.</font>

84
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

85
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:37,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Park.</font>

86
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:43,251
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to tell you.</font>

87
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,222
<font color=#FFFF00>Number 1, it's personal. Number 2, it's work-related.</font>

88
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,362
<font color=#FFFF00>Number one.</font>

89
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,862
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say it.</font>

90
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:54,532
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm taking off.</font>

91
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,131
<font color=#FFFF00>For the past 10 years, I planned to name...</font>

92
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:35,542
<font color=#FFFF00>my future company as "On".</font>

93
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,372
<font color=#FFFF00>But as soon as I heard your name, On Jung Sun,</font>

94
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:41,182
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt like I had lost.</font>

95
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:46,112
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you thinking about?</font>

96
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:49,922
<font color=#FFFF00>You.</font>

97
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,622
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Stop it.</font>

98
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:56,092
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you said you won't be on the show today.</font>

99
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,331
<font color=#FFFF00>The producer called me.</font>

100
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:00,201
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you in trouble?</font>

101
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,662
<font color=#FFFF00>A little bit.</font>

102
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked for you to be on the show.</font>

103
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,802
<font color=#FFFF00>So someone had an allergic reaction at Good Soup?</font>

104
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you know everything.</font>

105
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,782
<font color=#FFFF00>I've figured everything out.</font>

106
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Go on the show.</font>

107
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,521
<font color=#FFFF00>I had some thoughts...</font>

108
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,852
<font color=#FFFF00>while taking that customer to the emergency room.</font>

109
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,722
<font color=#FFFF00>"This isn't it."</font>

110
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,122
<font color=#FFFF00>"This isn't the way to go."</font>

111
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,432
<font color=#FFFF00>- You still have to go on once more. - No, I won't do it.</font>

112
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,432
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too early to let your guards down.</font>

113
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Your customers aren't coming to the restaurant for your cooking.</font>

114
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,302
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I won't do it.</font>

115
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,742
<font color=#FFFF00>It's right to go slowly.</font>

116
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,881
<font color=#FFFF00>As long as I don't lose the customers I have now, that's fine.</font>

117
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,682
<font color=#FFFF00>In the end, you'll do what you want...</font>

118
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,682
<font color=#FFFF00>regardless of what I say.</font>

119
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why do you need me?</font>

120
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:06,732
<font color=#FFFF00>You may be the owner chef of Good Soup,</font>

121
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:10,372
<font color=#FFFF00>but don't forget I'm the person who can take you down from that place.</font>

122
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't forgotten.</font>

123
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:16,842
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm making changes and compromises.</font>

124
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,071
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like they aren't enough though.</font>

125
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you just trust me until the end?</font>

126
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,511
<font color=#FFFF00>The same feeling you had in the beginning.</font>

127
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:27,521
<font color=#FFFF00>Feeling.</font>

128
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:33,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Feeling.</font>

129
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,261
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

130
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:50,501
<font color=#FFFF00>(I have to talk to you. What are you doing?)</font>

131
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,202
<font color=#FFFF00>(I have to talk to you. What are you doing?)</font>

132
00:09:58,911 --> 00:09:59,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo.</font>

133
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:02,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really going to start working now?</font>

134
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,911
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're up early. - Yes.</font>

135
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:06,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want some tea?</font>

136
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:09,082
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I want food.</font>

137
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,852
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you eat as soon as you wake up?</font>

138
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:24,602
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

139
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,041
<font color=#FFFF00>She woke up early.</font>

140
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,881
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you eating that?</font>

141
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:41,822
<font color=#FFFF00>You hate boiled eggs.</font>

142
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,251
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

143
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:52,131
<font color=#FFFF00>I got changed.</font>

144
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:55,001
<font color=#FFFF00>Where? Why were you changing?</font>

145
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,001
<font color=#FFFF00>He told me earlier that he's drinking water.</font>

146
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,531
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he drink water? What is he trying to do?</font>

147
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,612
<font color=#FFFF00>He should become a writer.</font>

148
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,342
<font color=#FFFF00>He makes me so curious.</font>

149
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo.</font>

150
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:09,482
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes? - Do you like him that much?</font>

151
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:14,322
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is it obvious? - It's very obvious.</font>

152
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,151
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to date too.</font>

153
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:19,421
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should. - With who?</font>

154
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:22,062
<font color=#FFFF00>Where can I find a man like Chef On?</font>

155
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:24,592
<font color=#FFFF00>You should find a man that suits you.</font>

156
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:25,891
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at my man?</font>

157
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,671
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with me?</font>

158
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:33,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I really just say that?</font>

159
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:35,901
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

160
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like him that much?</font>

161
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:41,181
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

162
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I might buy a bicycle.</font>

163
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:47,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Why all of a sudden?</font>

164
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,281
<font color=#FFFF00>If we want to do research,</font>

165
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:51,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Good Soup...</font>

166
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:53,562
<font color=#FFFF00>is too close to drive and too far to walk.</font>

167
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:55,322
<font color=#FFFF00>I can get there fast on a bicycle.</font>

168
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it Chef On? Like last time?</font>

169
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,462
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, my. - No way.</font>

170
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo.</font>

171
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Does he not have a home?</font>

172
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,141
<font color=#FFFF00>No one's home anyway.</font>

173
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,702
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

174
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Make me some breakfast.</font>

175
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:51,011
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't have to make soup.</font>

176
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:53,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I like making soup.</font>

177
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:56,151
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to make a lot of soup because someone likes it.</font>

178
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:06,931
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it not good?</font>

179
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:09,602
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's delicious.</font>

180
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:11,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Come.</font>

181
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

182
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:26,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Clams are good for people that have to use their brains.</font>

183
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:55,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever felt this?</font>

184
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Once you find out the result of the things you didn't know,</font>

185
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,082
<font color=#FFFF00>all the pieces come together like a puzzle, becoming a single picture.</font>

186
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,192
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

187
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,391
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of one incident,</font>

188
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,622
<font color=#FFFF00>everything lines up, and you come to a realization.</font>

189
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:09,722
<font color=#FFFF00>That's pretty good.</font>

190
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:14,531
<font color=#FFFF00>If the woman you like likes another man,</font>

191
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,202
<font color=#FFFF00>will you give up?</font>

192
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I might give up, but not before I give it my all.</font>

193
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:21,901
<font color=#FFFF00>Same with me.</font>

194
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what if that man was me?</font>

195
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:28,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you still go all the way?</font>

196
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:31,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

197
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:33,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Wouldn't you do the same?</font>

198
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:41,222
<font color=#FFFF00>I would.</font>

199
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,562
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to propose next week.</font>

200
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,261
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure to prepare it well.</font>

201
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:50,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if she likes someone else, you'll become the star that night.</font>

202
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat this too.</font>

00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:16,592
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Hyun Soo)</font>

205
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,161
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

206
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,161
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I come over for an interview?</font>

207
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go, Hyun Soo.</font>

208
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:24,801
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't reply yet.</font>

209
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,702
<font color=#FFFF00>How frustrating. Why are you texting him?</font>

210
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:30,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Just call him.</font>

211
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:32,312
<font color=#FFFF00>He's busy.</font>

212
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,181
<font color=#FFFF00>I might disturb him at work.</font>

213
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,181
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he finds me annoying?</font>

214
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,411
<font color=#FFFF00>He loves you. Why would he think you're annoying?</font>

215
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:41,622
<font color=#FFFF00>Here it is.</font>

216
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,322
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

217
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,492
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to an interview.</font>

218
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:47,562
<font color=#FFFF00>(I'm going to an interview.)</font>

219
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:49,661
<font color=#FFFF00>She's working.</font>

220
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,661
<font color=#FFFF00>At least she's not seeing her boyfriend.</font>

221
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,671
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for real this time.</font>

222
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Come.</font>

223
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyung, we should go now. Let's go.</font>

224
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:05,171
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so strange to see you like this.</font>

225
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:06,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Kyung.</font>

226
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:08,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be sorry.</font>

227
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying I'm jealous.</font>

228
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:15,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here at this hour?</font>

229
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:20,862
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to be a part of "Unruly Detectives".</font>

230
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,862
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't say anything yesterday. What happened?</font>

231
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:27,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw what Director Min's team wrote,</font>

232
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:29,301
<font color=#FFFF00>and it's not going anywhere.</font>

233
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure it will fail. It'll just be hard work.</font>

234
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to take care of it.</font>

235
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,771
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Let's do that.</font>

236
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I like that it's simple.</font>

237
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,612
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad I decided to work with you.</font>

238
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me think the same about you too.</font>

239
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,122
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

240
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:50,722
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I are both achievement-oriented people.</font>

241
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:57,592
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

242
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,462
<font color=#FFFF00>there is one thing I'm worried about.</font>

243
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:06,131
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I are really different when it comes to love.</font>

244
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:10,272
<font color=#FFFF00>It was unexpected and disappointing.</font>

245
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you like Hyun Soo.</font>

246
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:18,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very sharp when it comes to things like this.</font>

247
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:21,282
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it when I met you.</font>

248
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:23,322
<font color=#FFFF00>And?</font>

249
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:24,792
<font color=#FFFF00>Why haven't you made a move?</font>

250
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:27,792
<font color=#FFFF00>You have all the qualifications of becoming the perfect man.</font>

251
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:32,431
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you would date Hyun Soo and marry her.</font>

252
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,862
<font color=#FFFF00>What have you been doing for the last five years?</font>

253
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,931
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you behind?</font>

254
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:39,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you even know who you're against?</font>

255
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:40,671
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough.</font>

256
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Ji.</font>

257
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,842
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a tendency to push people to the edge.</font>

258
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,911
<font color=#FFFF00>You aroused me enough.</font>

259
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:53,381
<font color=#FFFF00>Please write your work like this.</font>

260
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:05,562
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so nice to eat while working.</font>

261
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it good?</font>

262
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:12,272
<font color=#FFFF00>How did he think of making a sandwich with sea urchin?</font>

263
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:15,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo, do you think there is a reason why...</font>

264
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,441
<font color=#FFFF00>the course meal is set this way? Maybe it's a theme.</font>

265
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:20,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure.</font>

266
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:23,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want more wine?</font>

267
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, please.</font>

268
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:33,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it okay?</font>

269
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,592
<font color=#FFFF00>It's delicious.</font>

270
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,161
<font color=#FFFF00>Enjoy.</font>

271
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:39,792
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'll see you later.</font>

272
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:41,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

273
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:48,901
<font color=#FFFF00>"I'll see you later."</font>

274
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I need to lie down.</font>

275
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:55,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Kyung, please be understanding.</font>

276
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,812
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because I've been holding it in for so long.</font>

277
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:01,151
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. I understand.</font>

278
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:57,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Why haven't you made a move?</font>

279
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,681
<font color=#FFFF00>What have you been doing for the last five years?</font>

280
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:15,062
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

281
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,092
<font color=#FFFF00>(Come!)</font>

282
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:22,461
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think? I came to see you after work.</font>

283
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it bother you that I'm always texting?</font>

284
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you always waiting for me since I reply slow?</font>

285
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:36,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

286
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:38,512
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know?</font>

287
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Because everyone is like that.</font>

288
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,451
<font color=#FFFF00>Same with me.</font>

289
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what "What are you doing" means?</font>

290
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,191
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

291
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss you.</font>

292
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you ever ask me what I'm doing?</font>

293
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm always curious what you're doing,</font>

294
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:06,211
<font color=#FFFF00>so whenever I open my eyes in the morning...</font>

295
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:14,322
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell me earlier?</font>

296
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,122
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I would have asked you.</font>

297
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:27,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I touch it?</font>

298
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead.</font>

299
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:40,981
<font color=#FFFF00>(Salt)</font>

300
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:47,881
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did it hurt? - Yes. It hurt a lot.</font>

301
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:51,221
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you get hurt?</font>

302
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:54,762
<font color=#FFFF00>- Were you beat? - No.</font>

303
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,991
<font color=#FFFF00>It happens to all chefs.</font>

304
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:02,701
<font color=#FFFF00>I got it while training. I'm still training now.</font>

305
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:04,772
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a relief.</font>

306
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:10,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you get this? "Salt"?</font>

307
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because you can't season without salt?</font>

308
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know that your brain is the one recognizing taste?</font>

309
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:19,151
<font color=#FFFF00>- I do. - When the brain finds salty taste,</font>

310
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,721
<font color=#FFFF00>it helps you taste the other tastes as well.</font>

311
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,322
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess salt is a good guy.</font>

312
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:27,491
<font color=#FFFF00>It helps other tastes to come alive along with it.</font>

313
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,461
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's a good guy.</font>

314
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,201
<font color=#FFFF00>After my parents got divorced,</font>

315
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:41,701
<font color=#FFFF00>I moved to France with Mom, and it was really tough.</font>

316
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,082
<font color=#FFFF00>I was 16 years old then.</font>

317
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:52,951
<font color=#FFFF00>I was really lonely.</font>

318
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,421
<font color=#FFFF00>But I couldn't be broken.</font>

319
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:02,322
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

320
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:07,431
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you crying?</font>

321
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:09,631
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not crying.</font>

322
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:27,181
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to kiss you.</font>

323
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,592
<font color=#FFFF00>You can dodge me if you don't want to.</font>

324
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:47,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on!</font>

325
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you think I wouldn't dodge you? You can't laugh after crying.</font>

326
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:51,941
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so mean.</font>

327
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:56,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Back then,</font>

328
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:58,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

329
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:01,522
<font color=#FFFF00>was really nervous that you might dodge me.</font>

330
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:05,122
<font color=#FFFF00>I was so happy you didn't.</font>

331
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:06,961
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why did you do this to me?</font>

332
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:08,622
<font color=#FFFF00>To make you laugh.</font>

333
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,701
<font color=#FFFF00>We can start kissing now.</font>

334
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:16,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I won't let you just do it.</font>

335
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:18,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

336
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:20,072
<font color=#FFFF00>You can choose.</font>

337
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,842
<font color=#FFFF00>The teenage version, the 20s version, or the 30s version?</font>

338
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:26,441
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take all, and add a refrigerator kiss on top.</font>

339
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,552
<font color=#FFFF00>(Temperature of Love)</font>

340
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Mr. Park getting married?</font>

341
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,562
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he had someone in his mind for a long time.</font>

342
00:26:56,562 --> 00:27:00,161
<font color=#FFFF00>There won't be any space for you to get in between them.</font>

343
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Mom call you?</font>

344
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:04,032
<font color=#FFFF00>When are you getting married? You should do it soon.</font>

345
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:06,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it strange when I proposed to you before?</font>

346
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,971
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no answer to such a thing.</font>

347
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:10,671
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to change our relationship.</font>

348
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Park's proposal will succeed thanks to this cake.</font>

349
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:16,211
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a girlfriend now. I want to introduce her to you.</font>

350
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:18,552
<font color=#FFFF00>You can ask her to come on the day I propose.</font>

351
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:19,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet together.</font>
