74
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,770

<font color="yellow">I heard that he just summoned the company lawyer.</font>

96
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,930
<font color="yellow">Did he get discharged?</font>

97
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,900
<font color="yellow">What is he scheming now?</font>

98
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,170
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

99

105

<font color="yellow">I'm not tired at all.</font>

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,670

111
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,770
<font color="yellow">It's old news, isn't it?</font>

112
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,500
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave Mom and I?</font>

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,930
<font color="yellow">I have no excuse.</font>

114
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,700

115
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,170

116
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,470
<font color="yellow">fell apart after you took me on a trip.</font>

117
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,270
<font color="yellow">Where did we go back then?</font>

118
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,770
<font color="yellow">To your mom's parents' house.</font>

119
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,140
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

120
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,530
<font color="yellow">I can't remember anything else...</font>

121
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,930
<font color="yellow">except for seeing a plane.</font>

122
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,970
<font color="yellow">That was my first flight.</font>

123
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,140

<font color="yellow">still remember that?</font>

125
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,400
<font color="yellow">You visited the restaurant a year ago, right?</font>

126
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,400
<font color="yellow">I was surprised when I read the note.</font>

127
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,400
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

128
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,640
<font color="yellow">Someone took a picture and I saw you in it.</font>

129
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,300
<font color="yellow">Na Ri's father was curious, so I visited time to time.</font>

130
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,600
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

132
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,430
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

133
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,400

134
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,140
<font color="yellow">When was it again?</font>

135
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,970
<font color="yellow">Was it after Mother passed away?</font>

136
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,000
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to say this,</font>

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,370

138
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,270
<font color="yellow">He's just not saying it out loud.</font>

139
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,000
<font color="yellow">Da Da kept telling me...</font>

140

141
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,140
<font color="yellow">Na Ri's land and the restaurant.</font>

142
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,200
<font color="yellow">That's why I told her father.</font>

143
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,970
<font color="yellow">Then he told he had to see her right away...</font>

144
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,530
<font color="yellow">and started to pack.</font>

145
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,230
<font color="yellow">He wanted to get the land back...</font>

146
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,270
<font color="yellow">and kick you out from Hong Dumplings.</font>

147
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,300
<font color="yellow">- That took a while. - Where is your father?</font>

148
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
<font color="yellow">He's sleeping.</font>

149
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,930
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here by yourself?</font>

150
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,200
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to clear my head from all the mess.</font>

151
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,700
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you're thinking about.</font>

152
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,530
<font color="yellow">Should I accept Dad?</font>

153
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,500
<font color="yellow">Should I take care of him forever?</font>

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,100
<font color="yellow">I think that's unfair.</font>

155
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,430
<font color="yellow">Mom must have been too nice to kick him out.</font>

156
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,170
<font color="yellow">What is family about?</font>

157
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,830
<font color="yellow">Your poor brain is suffering because of you.</font>

158
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,830
<font color="yellow">There's more.</font>

159
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,570
<font color="yellow">I told him to live freely,</font>

160
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
<font color="yellow">but I don't want Nan Gil to leave.</font>

161
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,900
<font color="yellow">Maybe we shouldn't have gone on the trip.</font>

162
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,470
<font color="yellow">Things like that.</font>

163
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,600
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying it.</font>

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

165
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,500
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you how to make dumplings.</font>

166
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,730
<font color="yellow">If you focus on something, you'll forget it all.</font>

167
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,630
<font color="yellow">You need to press on it evenly.</font>

168
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,230
<font color="yellow">Why are they all different sizes? Make it even.</font>

169
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,970
<font color="yellow">Stop being so serious.</font>

170
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,900
<font color="yellow">Are you going to hire me?</font>

171
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,770
<font color="yellow">You have mood swings because you think too much.</font>

172
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,770
<font color="yellow">Dad can't stay at home all the time.</font>

173
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,130
<font color="yellow">Maybe he should learn how to make dumplings.</font>

174
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,470
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

175
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,400
<font color="yellow">- Don't do that. - Na Ri.</font>

176
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,670
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

177
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,570
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

178
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,670
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

179
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,230
<font color="yellow">It's just as I had built it.</font>

180
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,400
<font color="yellow">That's a lie. Boss and I renovated it.</font>

181
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,830
<font color="yellow">How many owners are there anyway?</font>

182
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,170
<font color="yellow">Mr. Original Owner,</font>

183
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,270
<font color="yellow">you must be reminiscing about the past.</font>

184
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,830
<font color="yellow">Would you like to try making some dumplings?</font>

185
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,870
<font color="yellow">What about kneading dough? We're doing it now.</font>

186
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,370
<font color="yellow">Kneading dough?</font>

187
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,430
<font color="yellow">You see.</font>

188
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,570
<font color="yellow">I have bad eyesight, so I don't do that kind of stuff.</font>

189
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,570
<font color="yellow">Hey, why do you always seem to avoid me?</font>

190
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,900
<font color="yellow">I wasn't avoiding you. I was doing my job.</font>

191
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,470
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep on talking back at me?</font>

192
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
<font color="yellow">Why is my daughter living here jobless?</font>

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,430
<font color="yellow">And why are you living here?</font>

194
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,000
<font color="yellow">Are you penniless and homeless?</font>

195
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,370
<font color="yellow">Where's all the money earned from the restaurant?</font>

196
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,700
<font color="yellow">Are you actually giving it to my daughter?</font>

197
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,200
<font color="yellow">Let's discuss this after I get off work.</font>

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,300
<font color="yellow">Work? You actually call making dumplings work?</font>

199
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,930
<font color="yellow">The fact that the person who made my eyes like this...</font>

200
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,500
<font color="yellow">is living here just absolutely drives me crazy!</font>

201
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,030
<font color="yellow">This property is Na Ri's and my land.</font>

202
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,800
<font color="yellow">This restaurant is also mine.</font>

203
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,270
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

204
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,500
<font color="yellow">If you have any questions, ask me.</font>

205
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,530
<font color="yellow">If you're bored, make some dumplings.</font>

206
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,700
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

207
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,900
<font color="yellow">How could an old man with bad eyesight make dumplings?</font>

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
<font color="yellow">I think I'll go and get some rest.</font>

209
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,430
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying being caught between you two!</font>

210
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,570
<font color="yellow">I wonder what our lawyer is up to these days.</font>

211
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,070
<font color="yellow">Why do you always dress like that?</font>

212
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,730
<font color="yellow">What brings you here along with the company lawyer?</font>

213
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,370
<font color="yellow">If you continue to turn down the developing project,</font>

214
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,670
<font color="yellow">you give me no choice but to report Na Ri's father.</font>

215
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,400
<font color="yellow">A busy man like you has time to do that?</font>

216
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,400
<font color="yellow">The statute of limitation for the 20-year...</font>

217
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,700
<font color="yellow">claim-obligation relationship has expired.</font>

218
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,200
<font color="yellow">He issued a false death report to hide his identity.</font>

219
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
<font color="yellow">Fabrication of official documents violates...</font>

220
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,400
<font color="yellow">Article 225 of Criminal Law and is...</font>

221
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,430
<font color="yellow">a serious felony that applies to 10 years in prison.</font>

222
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,330
<font color="yellow">I don't know what he's thinking by showing up here.</font>

223
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,600
<font color="yellow">He's a downright con-artist.</font>

224
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,800
<font color="yellow">Trouble will only ruin your relationship with Na Ri.</font>

225
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,230
<font color="yellow">Build the resort and try downsizing the park.</font>

226
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,370
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you care about me.</font>

227
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,530
<font color="yellow">Why don't you worry about yourself instead?</font>

228
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,230
<font color="yellow">How much longer do I have to put up with your grudges?</font>

229
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,170
<font color="yellow">Was it my fault your marriage got called off?</font>

230
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,430
<font color="yellow">In the end, it was you who chose me!</font>

231
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,730
<font color="yellow">I'm not taking your side this time.</font>

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,300
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

233
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,930
<font color="yellow">I'll have to go meet Hong Na Ri.</font>

234
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,400
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kwon, don't you dare go near Na Ri.</font>

235
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,730
<font color="yellow">If you do, I assure you I'll lose my mind.</font>

236
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,070
<font color="yellow">I'm giving up the park. What more do you want?</font>

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,300
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kwon!</font>

238
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,030
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling Ms. Kwon now?</font>

239
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,370
<font color="yellow">It's as if we've been married for 10 years. It's weird.</font>

240
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,900
<font color="yellow">Why did he bring such a large bag with no clothes?</font>

241
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,230
<font color="yellow">You saw my father's clothes, didn't you?</font>

242
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,770
<font color="yellow">He must have worn the same clothes for 20 years.</font>

243
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

244
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,800
<font color="yellow">When you mention your father, it reminds me of that.</font>

245
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,900
<font color="yellow">Of what?</font>

246
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,840
<font color="yellow">That it's as if we've been married for 10 years.</font>

247
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,300
<font color="yellow">I take it back.</font>

248
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,100
<font color="yellow">There was no dating period needless to say romance.</font>

249
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,400
<font color="yellow">Stop telling your father to make dumplings.</font>

250
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,500
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

251
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,100
<font color="yellow">Your father has never made dumplings before.</font>

252
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,870
<font color="yellow">- How do you know? - Your mother told me.</font>

253
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,970
<font color="yellow">As a child, I liked going to the market,</font>

254
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,900
<font color="yellow">so my mother would always take me with her.</font>

255
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,970
<font color="yellow">The dumplings I had at the market...</font>

256
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,070
<font color="yellow">tasted the same as the ones at Hong Dumplings.</font>

257
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,900
<font color="yellow">Your father bought dumplings from the market...</font>

258
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,340
<font color="yellow">to sell at Hong Dumplings without your mom's knowing.</font>

259
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,170
<font color="yellow">It's a shameful history of Hong Dumplings.</font>

260
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,200
<font color="yellow">I guess you used to like markets and crowded places.</font>

261
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,270
<font color="yellow">- What if... - You said you don't like subjunctives.</font>

262
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,670
<font color="yellow">What if you met me when I was with Mom?</font>

263
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,570
<font color="yellow">I practiced for that kind of situation just in case.</font>

264
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,770
<font color="yellow">Hello, Na Ri. Nice to meet you. My name's Nan Gil.</font>

265
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,770
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing we never crossed paths.</font>

266
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,670
<font color="yellow">Your first impression of me wasn't good anyway.</font>

267
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,870
<font color="yellow">No, that's not true.</font>

268
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,970
<font color="yellow">Snake! Watch out!</font>

269
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,500
<font color="yellow">- Where? - I'm just saying to beware of snakes.</font>

270
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,030
<font color="yellow">What? Did he just fool me?</font>

271
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,340
<font color="yellow">I'll see you again.</font>

272
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,100
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

273
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,100
<font color="yellow">Watch out! A wild boar!</font>

274
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,340
<font color="yellow">There's a wild boar!</font>

275
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,200
<font color="yellow">It was a prank my mother used to play on me.</font>

276
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,200
<font color="yellow">I wondered how you played the same prank.</font>

277
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,900
<font color="yellow">"Maybe my mother sent you to cheer me up."</font>

278
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

279
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,840
<font color="yellow">I never thought you'd be my stepdad.</font>

280
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,670
<font color="yellow">Let's change the subject.</font>

281
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,270
<font color="yellow">This is a video I saw at home when I had my phone off.</font>

282
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,730
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to see it? - Sure.</font>

283
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,630
<font color="yellow">(Neighborhood Friend)</font>

284
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,500
<font color="yellow">I can't wait.</font>

285
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
<font color="yellow">- What are you having? - I want kimchi dumpling.</font>

286
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,470
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

287
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,130
<font color="yellow">Did you learn about Hong Dumplings on television?</font>

288
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,630
<font color="yellow">We dropped by after visiting the Robot Museum.</font>

289
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, the Robot Museum!</font>

290
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,870
<font color="yellow">Then I guess you'll come whenever you visit the museum.</font>

291
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,770
<font color="yellow">He'll drive away all our customers. What is he doing?</font>

292
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,300
<font color="yellow">Mr. Hong Sung Kyu.</font>

293
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,400
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Soon Rye?</font>

294
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,130
<font color="yellow">You know Chairman Kwon, don't you?</font>

295
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,100
<font color="yellow">How is your health?</font>

296
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,170
<font color="yellow">Cut the small talk and shut it.</font>

297
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,840
<font color="yellow">I assumed you would come to me if you were alive.</font>

298
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you thought you could claim this land...</font>

299
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,340
<font color="yellow">now that Na Ri's mother died.</font>

300
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,230
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing like that. I thought I should...</font>

301
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,670
<font color="yellow">come back home at least once before I die.</font>

302
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,200
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back at me!</font>

303
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,130
<font color="yellow">Just listen.</font>

304
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,730
<font color="yellow">From now on, do as I say.</font>

305
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,400
<font color="yellow">You see...</font>

306
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,670
<font color="yellow">My eyesight is bad...</font>

307
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,100
<font color="yellow">and I have the energy to obey your orders.</font>

308
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,930
<font color="yellow">That's good news.</font>

309
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,670
<font color="yellow">Now that you're spiritless, you can turn yourself in.</font>

310
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,370
<font color="yellow">Turn myself in?</font>

311
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,900
<font color="yellow">Why is Ko Nan Gil claiming the land to be his property?</font>

312
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,230
<font color="yellow">It's all because you have been on the run!</font>

313
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,430
<font color="yellow">Turn yourself in, get punishment and recover your name.</font>

314
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,000
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

315
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,770
<font color="yellow">Go to prison in this cold and at this age?</font>

316
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,100
<font color="yellow">My son is going to want to meet you.</font>

317
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,570
<font color="yellow">He says he has feelings for your daughter.</font>

318
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,770
<font color="yellow">He volunteered to be Na Ri's attorney.</font>

319
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,270
<font color="yellow">I just can't stand it.</font>

320
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,830
<font color="yellow">Cooperate with investigations and do your time.</font>

321
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,600
<font color="yellow">After that, transfer the property under your name.</font>

322
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,330
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I ended up being your attorney,</font>

323
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,070
<font color="yellow">but the documents say your dad passed away 5 years ago.</font>

324
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,570
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

325
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,470
<font color="yellow">Forging official documents will land you in prison.</font>

326
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,300
<font color="yellow">What has your father been doing?</font>

327
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,670
<font color="yellow">Normal people can't do this.</font>

328
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,230
<font color="yellow">She hasn't seen him in 20 years.</font>

329
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,670
<font color="yellow">How would she know?</font>

330
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,770
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Why did he suddenly surface after 20 years?</font>

331
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,670
<font color="yellow">He said he saw the restaurant in his dreams.</font>

332
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,000
<font color="yellow">The winter is tough for him.</font>

333
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,170
<font color="yellow">You're so understanding of something so ridiculous.</font>

334
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,930
<font color="yellow">What a good daughter.</font>

335
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,970
<font color="yellow">Then what should I do? Tell him to turn himself in?</font>

336
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,700
<font color="yellow">People like him don't turn themselves in.</font>

337
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
<font color="yellow">- Na Ri. - Yes?</font>

338
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,130
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

339
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,770
<font color="yellow">- And Nan Gil. - What?</font>

340
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,300
<font color="yellow">Let's settle things.</font>

341
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,200
<font color="yellow">I won't build the resort on Na Ri's land,</font>

342
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,100
<font color="yellow">so change the deed to her name.</font>

343
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,330
<font color="yellow">And I will quit being her attorney.</font>

344
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,000
<font color="yellow">Why do I get this feeling he'll cause trouble?</font>

345
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,330
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

346
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,270
<font color="yellow">Where did my daughter and that punk go?</font>

347
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,800
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but Boss doesn't tell us where he goes.</font>

348
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,270
<font color="yellow">Call him!</font>

349
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,270
<font color="yellow">Who? Boss?</font>

350
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,130
<font color="yellow">Get me a cab.</font>

351
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,300
<font color="yellow">A cab?</font>

352
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,930
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

353
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,270
<font color="yellow">Duk Shim, would you take over?</font>

354
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,930
<font color="yellow">Hey. Give me money for cab fare.</font>

355
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,930
<font color="yellow">How is he so shameless?</font>

356
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,570
<font color="yellow">(Transfer of Ownership)</font>

357
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,600
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

358
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,230
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Hong Na Ri? - Yes?</font>

359
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,300
<font color="yellow">This is the police.</font>

360
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,330
<font color="yellow">You're Hong Sung Kyu's daughter, correct?</font>

361
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,500
<font color="yellow">I'll give him the phone. Talk to him.</font>

362
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,930
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

363
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,970
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

364
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,230
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to be on the run forever,</font>

365
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,370
<font color="yellow">so I turned myself in.</font>

366
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,870
<font color="yellow">They said this is the only way to get my name back.</font>

367
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,630
<font color="yellow">Why did you suddenly...</font>

368
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,570
<font color="yellow">I hear it'll be easier for me...</font>

369
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,430
<font color="yellow">if I have a lawyer.</font>

370
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,570
<font color="yellow">My father turned himself in...</font>

371
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,970
<font color="yellow">and needs a lawyer.</font>

372
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,130
<font color="yellow">He turned himself in?</font>

373
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go and find out what's going on.</font>

374
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
<font color="yellow">We won't be able to once the investigation starts.</font>

375
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,830
<font color="yellow">I'll go today.</font>

376
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,430
<font color="yellow">We'll go with you. You said you're quitting law.</font>

377
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,900
<font color="yellow">I'll go alone.</font>

378
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,070
<font color="yellow">I was correct.</font>

379
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,130
<font color="yellow">I wondered why I had so many flaws...</font>

380
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,330
<font color="yellow">when my mom is a total angel.</font>

381
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,730
<font color="yellow">This is all because of Dad's genes.</font>

382
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,600
<font color="yellow">I'm moody, I get stressed easily,</font>

383
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,930
<font color="yellow">and I make rash decisions.</font>

384
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
<font color="yellow">Are you self-reflecting?</font>

385
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,000
<font color="yellow">No. I'm blaming my genes.</font>

386
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,870
<font color="yellow">You can't say that in front of someone without parents.</font>

387
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,930
<font color="yellow">Think positively. I'm actually kind of...</font>

388
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,300
<font color="yellow">relieved now.</font>

389
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,830
<font color="yellow">Because my dad, who's been bugging you here, is gone?</font>

390
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,800
<font color="yellow">He can do this much in order to get his name back.</font>

391
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
<font color="yellow">Should he live in hiding forever?</font>

392
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,570
<font color="yellow">We could've discussed it first.</font>

393
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,970
<font color="yellow">He could've changed his clothes.</font>

394
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,030
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why he went so suddenly either,</font>

395
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,870
<font color="yellow">but don't worry. Trust Duk Bong.</font>

396
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,300
<font color="yellow">You have a useful neighborhood friend.</font>

397
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,930
<font color="yellow">This is what we have so far. Read it over.</font>

398
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,470
<font color="yellow">Wow. You are good looking.</font>

399
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,230
<font color="yellow">I wish you were my son-in-law.</font>

400
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,470
<font color="yellow">My eyesight isn't very good. I got hurt, you see.</font>

401
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,270
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

402
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,630
<font color="yellow">What number son...</font>

403
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,470
<font color="yellow">of Chairman Kwon are you?</font>

404
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,570
<font color="yellow">You saw Chairman Kwon, didn't you?</font>

405
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,130
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

406
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,870
<font color="yellow">You can't lie to me.</font>

407
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,430
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.</font>

408
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,070
<font color="yellow">I saw him briefly when he passed by Hong Dumplings.</font>

409
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,000
<font color="yellow">Forging official documents is a felony.</font>

410
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,300
<font color="yellow">You must be alert and answer honestly.</font>

411
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,700
<font color="yellow">How long have you known my daughter?</font>

412
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,800
<font color="yellow">You ran away with Na Ri when she was young, didn't you?</font>

413
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,130
<font color="yellow">You can be found guilty of kidnapping your own child.</font>

414
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,300
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kwon...</font>

415
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,970
<font color="yellow">gave me airfare and made me do it.</font>

416
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,900
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kwon...</font>

417
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,470
<font color="yellow">tortured our family in order to take that land from us.</font>

418
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:21,630
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I never imagined he still couldn't have it.</font>

419
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,330
<font color="yellow">I won't sell this land.</font>

420
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,570
<font color="yellow">But why have I never met you before?</font>

421
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,670
<font color="yellow">I studied abroad.</font>

422
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,370
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

423
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,870
<font color="yellow">You seem to be similar in age to my son and daughter.</font>

424
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,000
<font color="yellow">You could be neighborhood friends.</font>

425
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,330
<font color="yellow">If you'd adjust the price...</font>

426
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,070
<font color="yellow">It really isn't about the money.</font>

427
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,700
<font color="yellow">I won't sell.</font>

428
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,500
<font color="yellow">He tortured them all their lives.</font>

429
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,930
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

430
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,800
<font color="yellow">He'll be back soon.</font>

431
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,600
<font color="yellow">He turned himself in,</font>

432
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,430
<font color="yellow">and he didn't commit any crimes with his fake identity,</font>

433
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,030
<font color="yellow">so he can pay a fine and avoid serving time.</font>

434
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,870
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry. - I'm not worried.</font>

435
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
<font color="yellow">He can do that much in order to get his name back.</font>

436
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,330
<font color="yellow">Good thinking.</font>

437
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,330
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Duk Bong.</font>

438
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you make him turn himself in?</font>

439
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,500
<font color="yellow">I agreed to eliminate his debt,</font>

440
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,830
<font color="yellow">so he should do something for me.</font>

441
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,730
<font color="yellow">What would a con man do?</font>

442
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,430
<font color="yellow">You seem to resent me,</font>

443
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,170
<font color="yellow">so I'm trying to get you together with Na Ri.</font>

444
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,730
<font color="yellow">Take care of it for him.</font>

445
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,200
<font color="yellow">I know it's about the land.</font>

446
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,470
<font color="yellow">I know you made Hong Sung Kyu a debtor and kidnapper.</font>

447
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,030
<font color="yellow">How dare you trust a con man and give me lip?</font>

448
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,530
<font color="yellow">You want him to recover his name...</font>

449
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,730
<font color="yellow">and file a lawsuit to claim the land!</font>

450
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,700
<font color="yellow">If you have no shame,</font>

451
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,170
<font color="yellow">at least have a conscience.</font>

452
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,070
<font color="yellow">You killed children...</font>

453
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,600
<font color="yellow">and pretended like you didn't know. And now,</font>

454
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,070
<font color="yellow">must you steal that land, too?</font>

455
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,330
<font color="yellow">That land...</font>

456
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,700
<font color="yellow">was ours from the start.</font>

457
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,230
<font color="yellow">It's right that we take it.</font>

458
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,270
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to go this far,</font>

459
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,100
<font color="yellow">but I swear I will make you stand trial.</font>

460
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,570
<font color="yellow">(Hong Na Ri's Footsteps)</font>

461
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,900
<font color="yellow">(Hong Na Ri's Footsteps)</font>

462
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,870
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Maybe it's because my heart is at peace,</font>

463
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,930
<font color="yellow">but I am sleeping very well.</font>

464
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,900
<font color="yellow">It's nice here.</font>

465
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,170
<font color="yellow">Did you really come to turn yourself in?</font>

466
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,030
<font color="yellow">That's what I said.</font>

467
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,000
<font color="yellow">I heard you'll be released soon. Hang in there.</font>

468
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,470
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong will take care of it.</font>

469
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,130
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

470
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,470
<font color="yellow">I really like that lawyer fellow.</font>

471
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,730
<font color="yellow">He's nothing like Chairman Kwon.</font>

472
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,870
<font color="yellow">He has a strong sense of responsibility.</font>

473
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,100
<font color="yellow">He's perfect for you.</font>

474
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,530
<font color="yellow">I was shocked at how quickly he ran over.</font>

475
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,470
<font color="yellow">He likes you, doesn't he?</font>

476
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,030
<font color="yellow">We're not like that.</font>

477
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,270
<font color="yellow">I'll never approve of that punk, Nan Gil.</font>

478
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,900
<font color="yellow">You have no right to say that.</font>

479
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,370
<font color="yellow">Any time his name comes up,</font>

480
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,630
<font color="yellow">you get worked up.</font>

481
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,900
<font color="yellow">My father said to thank you.</font>

482
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,800
<font color="yellow">I was really mean to him.</font>

483
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,070
<font color="yellow">Your father seems to make your life difficult.</font>

484
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,430
<font color="yellow">You did good.</font>

485
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,800
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil does it well, but I can't.</font>

486
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,330
<font color="yellow">You have your mother's smile.</font>

487
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,630
<font color="yellow">Sorry, that just came out.</font>

488
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,200
<font color="yellow">Let's not go to Seulgi-ri. Where should we go?</font>

489
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,500
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

490
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
<font color="yellow">It's nice seeing you outside of Seulgi-ri.</font>

491
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,270
<font color="yellow">You look better here.</font>

492
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,170
<font color="yellow">Don't quit your job.</font>

493
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,630
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I didn't like Seulgi-ri.</font>

494
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,070
<font color="yellow">I got bored after a day and went back to Seoul.</font>

495
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,630
<font color="yellow">I'm amazed that I'm doing fine there.</font>

496
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,170
<font color="yellow">I feel guilty toward my mom.</font>

497
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,470
<font color="yellow">You don't look happy there to me.</font>

498
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,170
<font color="yellow">Do you know how conflicted you look?</font>

499
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,770
<font color="yellow">It would be strange not to be with two dads.</font>

500
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,530
<font color="yellow">One is in a holding cell and the other wants to leave.</font>

501
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,030
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one who can protect Seulgi-ri.</font>

502
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,030
<font color="yellow">Boss gave this to me.</font>

503
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,900
<font color="yellow">This has the business know-how for Hong Dumplings.</font>

504
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,630
<font color="yellow">He told me to study it.</font>

505
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,200
<font color="yellow">More shockingly, he wants me to write in it now.</font>

506
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,500
<font color="yellow">Why is he doing this to me? Do I look studious to you?</font>

507
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,000
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh. - Must I...</font>

508
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,270
<font color="yellow">take on this burden at this age?</font>

509
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,430
<font color="yellow">Aren't you only a year younger than Mr. Ko?</font>

510
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,630
<font color="yellow">No way. Really?</font>

511
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,400
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil was just very mature.</font>

512
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,800
<font color="yellow">We will take a vote, the democratic way.</font>

513
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,030
<font color="yellow">If you'll stay even after Boss leaves,</font>

514
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,770
<font color="yellow">touch your elbow to your mouth.</font>

515
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,330
<font color="yellow">Spin 100 times.</font>

516
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,740
<font color="yellow">No one?</font>

517
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,000
<font color="yellow">We will all leave if Boss leaves. It's unanimous!</font>

518
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,740
<font color="yellow">Hong Dumplings is loyalty.</font>

519
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,240
<font color="yellow">- Loyalty. - Loyalty.</font>

520
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,170
<font color="yellow">Again. Hong Dumplings is loyalty!</font>

521
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,900
<font color="yellow">- Loyalty. - Good.</font>

522
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,070
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

523
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,300
<font color="yellow">Go with me to a year-end party.</font>

524
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,130
<font color="yellow">My friends throw a party every year.</font>

525
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,570
<font color="yellow">It'll be embarrassing to go alone.</font>

526
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,870
<font color="yellow">So be my partner.</font>

527
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,270
<font color="yellow">I know someone who likes parties.</font>

528
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,600
<font color="yellow">That someone already became enemies with my friends.</font>

529
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,770
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

530
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,330
<font color="yellow">She claims it's because they badmouthed me,</font>

531
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,070
<font color="yellow">but they were probably just drunk.</font>

532
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,300
<font color="yellow">I represented your fathers. Aren't you grateful?</font>

533
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,270
<font color="yellow">It should be a give and take.</font>

534
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,900
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr. Attorney.</font>

535
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,100
<font color="yellow">It should be a give and take.</font>

536
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,240
<font color="yellow">How immature.</font>

537
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,900
<font color="yellow">Why... Why are you here? Aren't you kneading?</font>

538
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you stuttering? Do you feel guilty?</font>

539
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,370
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

540
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,270
<font color="yellow">You'll freeze to death, trying to look pretty.</font>

541
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,100
<font color="yellow">It's so cold. Mom, I'm here.</font>

542
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,570
<font color="yellow">My precious daughter. Come in.</font>

543
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,530
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

544
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,370
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

545
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,100
<font color="yellow">You'll freeze to death, trying to look pretty.</font>

546
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,300
<font color="yellow">First my stepdad, then my mom. Stop confusing me.</font>

547
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,500
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

548
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,300
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

549
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,430
<font color="yellow">Here's the bankbook and ledger for the restaurant.</font>

550
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,100
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to run Hong Dumplings?</font>

551
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,430
<font color="yellow">It'll run itself.</font>

552
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,270
<font color="yellow">Yong Kyu is managing the ingredients and payroll.</font>

553
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,330
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to ask where I went with Duk Bong?</font>

554
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,030
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell I'm holding back?</font>

555
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,170
<font color="yellow">You're so good at it.</font>

556
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,130
<font color="yellow">But why are you holding back?</font>

557
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,400
<font color="yellow">He's representing your father. I can't say anything.</font>

558
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,930
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be like you watched a movie,</font>

559
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,570
<font color="yellow">had tea, and had fun with him.</font>

560
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,570
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm... I'm not interested in looking at this.</font>

561
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,930
<font color="yellow">- You're stuttering. You do feel guilty. - I do not.</font>

562
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,400
<font color="yellow">We watched a musical and had tea.</font>

563
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,370
<font color="yellow">You don't need to tell me everything.</font>

564
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil.</font>

565
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,330
<font color="yellow">Girls like Duk Shim may follow you around in Seoul.</font>

566
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,300
<font color="yellow">I didn't think of that. You were fine taking the bus,</font>

567
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,130
<font color="yellow">but now you can't go to Seoul without Duk Bong.</font>

568
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,240
<font color="yellow">- Just admit you don't like it. - Be honest.</font>

569
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,570
<font color="yellow">Say you don't trust me living alone in Seoul.</font>

570
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,800
<font color="yellow">Be honest and say my neighborhood friend bothers you.</font>

571
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
<font color="yellow">You're staying out all night if you come past midnight!</font>

572
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,700
<font color="yellow">How many times did you come home early morning?</font>

573
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
<font color="yellow">Don't be unreasonable after playing until now.</font>

574
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,830
<font color="yellow">Don't act cool and then hold a grudge.</font>

575
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,330
<font color="yellow">It's late, so go to sleep.</font>

576
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,770
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

577
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,570
<font color="yellow">Look if you want to know how to run the restaurant!</font>

578
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,200
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil! You are so childish! Seriously!</font>

579
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,970
<font color="yellow">Why did you say that?</font>

580
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,600
<font color="yellow">Why did I say that?</font>

581
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,170
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo.</font>

582
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,700
<font color="yellow">Na Ri. What are you doing here?</font>

583
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,870
<font color="yellow">I waited for you after my second consultation.</font>

584
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,900
<font color="yellow">When are you coming back to work?</font>

585
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling people I'm coming back? I'm not.</font>

586
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,470
<font color="yellow">You're determined to destroy me.</font>

587
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,630
<font color="yellow">If you don't come back, I'll have to quit.</font>

588
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,270
<font color="yellow">Like I'd believe you. You have too much debt to quit.</font>

589
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,240
<font color="yellow">- Come with me. - Why?</font>

590
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,930
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to return to work,</font>

591
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,740
<font color="yellow">marry Nan Gil and save me.</font>

592
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,470
<font color="yellow">- What? - You took a leave to get married,</font>

593
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,240
<font color="yellow">so get married for real.</font>

594
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,770
<font color="yellow">How could you bring up marriage to me?</font>

595
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,530
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. Keep it brief.</font>

596
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,530
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong asked me to go with him to a year-end party.</font>

597
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,900
<font color="yellow">So I waited to ask you for advice on a party dress.</font>

598
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,100
<font color="yellow">I was clueless.</font>

599
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,830
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because of Nan Gil.</font>

600
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,170
<font color="yellow">I guess you heeded my warning.</font>

601
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,170
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

602
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,000
<font color="yellow">Your warning really hit me. Thanks.</font>

603
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

604
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,130
<font color="yellow">But Na Ri,</font>

605
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,700
<font color="yellow">don't act high and mighty in front of me anymore.</font>

606
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,230
<font color="yellow">- What? - You're just an average woman...</font>

607
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,800
<font color="yellow">who weighed your options...</font>

608
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,700
<font color="yellow">between Nan Gil and Duk Bong and chose money.</font>

609
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,400
<font color="yellow">My motto these days is to become an average woman.</font>

610
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,630
<font color="yellow">Stop acting uninterested,</font>

611
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,900
<font color="yellow">and look up year-end party looks.</font>

612
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,670
<font color="yellow">The internet is full of information.</font>

613
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,630
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

614
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,530
<font color="yellow">I heard you ruined Duk Bong's friends' party...</font>

615
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,970
<font color="yellow">because they were badmouthing him.</font>

616
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,630
<font color="yellow">I guess you talk about me behind my back.</font>

617
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,600
<font color="yellow">I know you like him.</font>

618
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,700
<font color="yellow">You're not one to ruin a party.</font>

619
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,470
<font color="yellow">I won't steal him from you. Don't worry.</font>

620
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,500
<font color="yellow">How do you feel right now?</font>

621
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,570
<font color="yellow">You and Duk Bong weren't dating, but you feel like...</font>

622
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,030
<font color="yellow">I took him from you, so you're upset and want to cry.</font>

623
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,430
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that feeling.</font>

624
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,530
<font color="yellow">The people you hurt...</font>

625
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,670
<font color="yellow">suffered 100 times more than that.</font>

626
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,830
<font color="yellow">Repent.</font>

627
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,630
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

628
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,370
<font color="yellow">impossible to like.</font>

629
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,670
<font color="yellow">Don't twist your words.</font>

630
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,500
<font color="yellow">Is it my fault that you don't like me?</font>

631
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,200
<font color="yellow">I'm too nice to say, "I hate you."</font>

632
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,070
<font color="yellow">Then learn how to.</font>

633
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,170
<font color="yellow">And if you like Duk Bong, do it your way.</font>

634
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,970
<font color="yellow">Don't bother people around him.</font>

635
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,000
<font color="yellow">Don't call me to your room.</font>

636
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,070
<font color="yellow">It's like I'm being called to the principal's office.</font>

637
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,270
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

638
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,030
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

639
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,530
<font color="yellow">Put it on.</font>

640
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,630
<font color="yellow">Awesome.</font>

641
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,130
<font color="yellow">They say the clothes make the man.</font>

642
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,130
<font color="yellow">You look good. We'll have to update our website.</font>

643
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,970
<font color="yellow">Stand straight.</font>

644
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,670
<font color="yellow">Can you do it?</font>

645
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,100
<font color="yellow">I know it's painful for you. I do,</font>

646
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,900
<font color="yellow">but think about us, too.</font>

647
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,030
<font color="yellow">This isn't right.</font>

648
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,730
<font color="yellow">You created this place.</font>

649
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,530
<font color="yellow">Why are you running away?</font>

650
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,770
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

651
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,430
<font color="yellow">He's so cool.</font>

652
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,700
<font color="yellow">You told me...</font>

653
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,930
<font color="yellow">if I let people take, they'll keep taking.</font>

654
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,970
<font color="yellow">That those who take have no conscience.</font>

655
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,730
<font color="yellow">So why are you letting them take from you?</font>

656
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,500
<font color="yellow">There's no one on your side.</font>

657
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,570
<font color="yellow">- I'm an evil boss. - You're right.</font>

658
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,300
<font color="yellow">You're an evil boss, but your workers love you.</font>

659
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,200
<font color="yellow">I went to the office for a consultation.</font>

660
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,300
<font color="yellow">- Did you decide yet? - No.</font>

661
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,370
<font color="yellow">I said I'd think about it some more.</font>

662
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,730
<font color="yellow">You have no respect for your stepdad's opinion.</font>

663
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,730
<font color="yellow">What happened to becoming an average guy?</font>

664
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,200
<font color="yellow">Try living as Ko Nan Gil, not my stepdad...</font>

665
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,630
<font color="yellow">or Hong Dumplings' owner.</font>

666
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,500
<font color="yellow">How will you start it?</font>

667
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,300
<font color="yellow">Ko Nan Gil.</font>

668
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,670
<font color="yellow">How will you start?</font>

669
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,370
<font color="yellow">We heard the rumor.</font>

670
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,600
<font color="yellow">Can't we get a picture with you?</font>

671
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,170
<font color="yellow">Of course, you can.</font>

672
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,500
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

673
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
<font color="yellow">No, no. Thank you.</font>

674
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,470
<font color="yellow">That's right. What did you order?</font>

675
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,870
<font color="yellow">Kimchi. You wanted kimchi dumplings, right?</font>

676
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:20,900
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil.</font>

677
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,370
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I need to relay this message,</font>

678
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,670
<font color="yellow">but Na Ri's father asked when you are leaving.</font>

679
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,400
<font color="yellow">Your outfit is especially loud today.</font>

680
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,030
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm dressed for a party.</font>

681
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,830
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any holiday parties to go to?</font>

682
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,000
<font color="yellow">(Hong Dumplings)</font>

683
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,870
<font color="yellow">Will we have a love triangle in Seulgi-ri?</font>

684
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,700
<font color="yellow">You look like you looked forward to the party.</font>

685
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,130
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong.</font>

686
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,830
<font color="yellow">I can't go.</font>

687
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,330
<font color="yellow">You didn't even give me time to find a replacement.</font>

688
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,170
<font color="yellow">It's not a serious event.</font>

689
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,770
<font color="yellow">Just stay for a few minutes and then leave.</font>

690
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

691
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,000
<font color="yellow">Don't feel bad.</font>

692
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,230
<font color="yellow">I don't need to bring a date actually.</font>

693
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,370
<font color="yellow">I'll drop you off at home.</font>

694
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,500
<font color="yellow">No, I want to go to Seoul...</font>

695
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,230
<font color="yellow">to a friend's cafe.</font>

696
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,600
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

697
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,230
<font color="yellow">You'll date as a regular man and woman?</font>

698
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,800
<font color="yellow">Don't make me laugh.</font>

699
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,600
<font color="yellow">Hey. I won't say anything then.</font>

700
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,930
<font color="yellow">I guess he has a conscience after making you cry.</font>

701
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,930
<font color="yellow">A conscience?</font>

702
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,800
<font color="yellow">"Let's date. This is day one."</font>

703
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,170
<font color="yellow">He beat around the bush and asked indirectly.</font>

704
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:45,930
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

705
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,570
<font color="yellow">What could you possibly have to say to me...</font>

706
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,770
<font color="yellow">that you came to visit?</font>

707
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:54,630
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

708
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,930
<font color="yellow">When Na Ri was young,</font>

709
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,030
<font color="yellow">you took her and ran away for money, right?</font>

710
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,830
<font color="yellow">Did you tell her that?</font>

711
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,100
<font color="yellow">Are you here to threaten me?</font>

712
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,570
<font color="yellow">I am not.</font>

713
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,770
<font color="yellow">When time passes,</font>

714
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,670
<font color="yellow">I'll get on my knees...</font>

715
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,030
<font color="yellow">and tell her everything, so...</font>

716
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,030
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

717
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,970
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Na Ri.</font>

718
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,300
<font color="yellow">She remembers it as her first flight.</font>

719
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,600
<font color="yellow">It's also why she became a flight attendant.</font>

720
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,830
<font color="yellow">That's probably why Mother never told her either.</font>

721
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,900
<font color="yellow">Just let her keep it as the memory of her first flight.</font>

722
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,770
<font color="yellow">Hey, I need to go home.</font>

723
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,030
<font color="yellow">You should go too.</font>

724
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,030
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

725
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,970
<font color="yellow">There goes Na Ri's specialty.</font>

726
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,100
<font color="yellow">Sitting silently and thinking.</font>

727
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,630
<font color="yellow">- Where are you? - Why?</font>

728
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:07,330
<font color="yellow">- I'm in Seoul. - Why?</font>

729
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,700
<font color="yellow">I'll pick you up. Come out.</font>

730
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,730
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

731
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,370
<font color="yellow">You said to tell you if I don't like it.</font>

732
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,630
<font color="yellow">I don't like you being there.</font>

733
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,330
<font color="yellow">If Ran Sook hears you say you don't like my being here,</font>

734
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,100
<font color="yellow">it'll be three strikes for you.</font>

735
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,730
<font color="yellow">What? He doesn't like you being here?</font>

736
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,670
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like your being here?</font>

737
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,330
<font color="yellow">I'm at Ran Sook's cafe.</font>

738
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,500
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go to the party?</font>

739
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,670
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm coming. Wait for me.</font>

740
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,900
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

741
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,930
<font color="yellow">You're the only person I know who knows Na Ri.</font>

742
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,870
<font color="yellow">You have Duk Shim.</font>

743
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,630
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

744
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,830
<font color="yellow">I'm sure if she saw me now, she'd say,</font>

745
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,700
<font color="yellow">"Awesome."</font>

746
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,770
<font color="yellow">Okay. Don't beat around the bush.</font>

747
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,870
<font color="yellow">Tell me what happened. I'll listen.</font>

748
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,830
<font color="yellow">I'm not in the mood to talk.</font>

749
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,300
<font color="yellow">Then why am I here?</font>

750
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,500
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

751
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,070
<font color="yellow">After I called you, I suddenly want to be alone.</font>

752
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,900
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong. Don't be like this to me.</font>

753
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,970
<font color="yellow">You look cool even when you act lonely.</font>

754
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,470
<font color="yellow">Is that what you expected?</font>

755
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,100
<font color="yellow">I'll search and read to you...</font>

756
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,230
<font color="yellow">things to console a man who's been dumped.</font>

757
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,570
<font color="yellow">How to...</font>

758
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,730
<font color="yellow">You're just like Duk Shim.</font>

759
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,370
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

760
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:10,700
<font color="yellow">I've never met up with a guy dressed like this before.</font>

761
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:15,070
<font color="yellow">It's the first time a guy came to my dad's hospital.</font>

762
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,330
<font color="yellow">We'll really end up being friends.</font>

763
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,900
<font color="yellow">Found it. Should I read it to you?</font>

764
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,030
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

765
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,130
<font color="yellow">You weren't dumped. You never even dated.</font>

766
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,670
<font color="yellow">"Most guys become furious when they are dumped."</font>

767
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,030
<font color="yellow">I said it's okay.</font>

768
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,700
<font color="yellow">"And whom is he enraged?"</font>

769
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,970
<font color="yellow">"Most guys turn the blame..."</font>

770
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,500
<font color="yellow">"on the woman."</font>

771
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,270
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you what happened, so stop it.</font>

772
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,000
<font color="yellow">Did you have dinner yet?</font>

773
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,070
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you go to Duk Bong's party?</font>

774
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,130
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful and sorry toward him,</font>

775
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,400
<font color="yellow">but I felt like I'd feel worse if I went.</font>

776
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:23,100
<font color="yellow">I realized why our feelings were so complicated.</font>

777
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,930
<font color="yellow">Now, all that remains is the situation between us.</font>

778
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,200
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil, why do you want to leave?</font>

779
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,670
<font color="yellow">So you can get together with Duk Bong.</font>

780
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,630
<font color="yellow">I wish it were something that cool, but it isn't.</font>

781
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,300
<font color="yellow">Now that your dad returned, I felt like I was...</font>

782
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,030
<font color="yellow">being unreasonable insisting it was my house.</font>

783
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,130
<font color="yellow">I felt uncomfortable and insecure.</font>

784
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,900
<font color="yellow">I wanted to find my own place.</font>

785
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,400
<font color="yellow">Something like that.</font>

786
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,630
<font color="yellow">So what? Will you shake it all off and find your place?</font>

787
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,400
<font color="yellow">Don't make it sound so easy.</font>

788
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,200
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

789
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,870
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

790
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,430
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

791
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,030
<font color="yellow">Thank you for being here instead of going to the party.</font>

792
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,230
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

793
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,230
<font color="yellow">You don't like dumplings, do you?</font>

794
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,870
<font color="yellow">Me? I do.</font>

795
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,870
<font color="yellow">I know you don't.</font>

796
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,630
<font color="yellow">You don't like dumplings,</font>

797
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,900
<font color="yellow">and your dad sold dumplings he bought from the market.</font>

798
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,070
<font color="yellow">And Mother's dumplings...</font>

799
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,230
<font color="yellow">Even my friends said they tasted bad.</font>

800
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,500
<font color="yellow">They were right.</font>

801
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,230
<font color="yellow">But now, people line up for Hong Dumplings,</font>

802
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,670
<font color="yellow">and it's a famous eatery that was on TV.</font>

803
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,430
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

804
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,530
<font color="yellow">So the Hong Dumplings now...</font>

805
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,800
<font color="yellow">was created by Ko Nan Gil.</font>

806
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,800
<font color="yellow">Hong Dumplings is Hong Na Ri's Hong Dumplings.</font>

807
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,600
<font color="yellow">No, it's Ko Nan Gil's Hong Dumplings.</font>

808
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,670
<font color="yellow">I've decided how to start.</font>

809
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,100
<font color="yellow">I won't leave.</font>

810
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,930
<font color="yellow">Hong Dumplings is where I belong.</font>

811
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,330
<font color="yellow">I'll go on trips, make friends,</font>

812
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,870
<font color="yellow">and visit Hong Na Ri who lives in Seoul.</font>

813
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,930
<font color="yellow">Welcome to Ko Nan Gil's Hong Dumplings.</font>

814
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,200
<font color="yellow">I need to check something.</font>

815
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,300
<font color="yellow">We agreed to meet as a regular man and woman.</font>

816
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,670
<font color="yellow">But why did we never get any closer?</font>

817
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,100
<font color="yellow">How many chances to kiss did we miss?</font>

818
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,730
<font color="yellow">I stopped counting after a while.</font>

819
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,300
<font color="yellow">I did that well.</font>

820
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,730
<font color="yellow">- Don't do that. - Na Ri.</font>

821
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,770
<font color="yellow">Did you think about how hard it was for me to stop?</font>

822
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,870
<font color="yellow">It was hard for me too.</font>

823
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,000
<font color="yellow">If you had left, you would've disappeared from my life.</font>

824
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,330
<font color="yellow">You said you'd wait, but thought about so many things.</font>

825
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,200
<font color="yellow">Regular men and women think a lot when they date...</font>

826
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,700
<font color="yellow">although it wasn't such a positive thought.</font>

827
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,970
<font color="yellow">I almost disappeared from your life.</font>

828
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,130
<font color="yellow">Welcome to my life.</font>

829
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,930
<font color="yellow">(Sweet Stranger and Me)</font>

830
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,470
<font color="yellow">I said to sleep at night. A family should eat together.</font>

831
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,070
<font color="yellow">Are you sure I was your first love?</font>

832
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,270
<font color="yellow">You were. But I returned to the real world.</font>

833
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,470
<font color="yellow">It'll be a pain to end your relationship as family.</font>

834
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,500
<font color="yellow">Just remain as neighborhood friends.</font>

835
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,070
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to give up on her. - I can't do it.</font>

836
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,270
<font color="yellow">What if Father comes home?</font>

837
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,130
<font color="yellow">Father, please don't mention Duk Bong in front of me!</font>

838
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,270
<font color="yellow">As you know, I'm Na Ri's man.</font>

839
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,600
<font color="yellow">- Let's set a date. - Don't touch my personal life.</font>

840
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,670
<font color="yellow">And I'm dating someone!</font>

841
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,500
<font color="yellow">What? Father? I'm meeting your father?</font>

842
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,430
<font color="yellow">Hey, Nan Gil. This place hasn't changed.</font>

843
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,730
<font color="yellow">Do you want to work here?</font>

844
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:34,130
<font color="yellow">The first time I said how I felt, I regretted it.</font>

845
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,330
<font color="yellow">The second time, I thought we could part ways.</font>

846
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,670
<font color="yellow">Now, I promise to spend every moment with you.</font>

847
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,000
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

848
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,230
<font color="yellow">Will you marry me?</font>
