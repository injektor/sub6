68
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,978
<font color="yellow">Did she sleep in a cold room last night?</font>

69
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:58,118
<font color="yellow">Her room was freezing cold this morning.</font>

70
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,548
<font color="yellow">I need to get it fixed as soon as possible.</font>

71

<font color="yellow">Hi, Seok Jun.</font>

72
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,918
<font color="yellow">Can you put me in touch with...</font>

73
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,078
<font color="yellow">a subcontractor that manufactures boilers?</font>

74
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:16,678
<font color="yellow">No. A friend's boiler broke down yesterday,</font>

75
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:18,418
<font color="yellow">and it needs fixing.</font>

76
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:21,788
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

77
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:23,918
<font color="yellow">Okay, thanks.</font>

78

<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

80
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:32,248
<font color="yellow">Do you want tea?</font>

81
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,748
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

82
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,218
<font color="yellow">I guess he's very upset.</font>

83
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:48,348
<font color="yellow">I always wondered what your place looked like.</font>

84
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,578
<font color="yellow">This is what it looks like.</font>

85
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:53,918
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

86
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,448
<font color="yellow">You like cup noodles.</font>

87
00:05:58,378 --> 00:05:59,448
<font color="yellow">You need to go.</font>

88
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,718
<font color="yellow">Only men can stay here. Women aren't allowed.</font>

89
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:03,218
<font color="yellow">I could get kicked out.</font>

90
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,048
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay.</font>

91
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:07,718
<font color="yellow">This is insane.</font>

92
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:13,718
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

93
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,848
<font color="yellow">- I'm really sorry. - Why did you look in there?</font>

94
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,418
<font color="yellow">What on earth happened?</font>

95
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:27,148
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave home?</font>

96
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,778
<font color="yellow">While waiting for you yesterday, I saw a notice saying...</font>

97
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,578
<font color="yellow">there was an empty room, so I rented it.</font>

98
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,948
<font color="yellow">- Why? - To be close to you.</font>

99
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:36,718
<font color="yellow">But why...</font>

100
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,618
<font color="yellow">- What about work? - I quit.</font>

101
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:40,978
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

102
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:44,118
<font color="yellow">I like you, and I'm on your side.</font>

103
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:47,018
<font color="yellow">I can't work for a company that fired an innocent man.</font>

104
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:49,348
<font color="yellow">Stop being silly and go back home.</font>

105
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,478
<font color="yellow">I paid three months' rent in advance.</font>

106
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,478
<font color="yellow">I can't let the money go to waste.</font>

107
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:58,848
<font color="yellow">- Who is it? - Can I come in?</font>

108
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:01,648
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

109
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,618
<font color="yellow">- Is this yours? - Yes, it is.</font>

110
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:17,218
<font color="yellow">It was hanging on the line, and it looked like yours.</font>

111
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:20,348
<font color="yellow">Oh, so that's where my clothes were at.</font>

112
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:27,878
<font color="yellow">Haven't you had breakfast yet?</font>

113
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,278
<font color="yellow">I should get something to eat.</font>

114
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:33,748
<font color="yellow">My mum sent me some ox bone soup. Do you want some?</font>

115
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:36,478
<font color="yellow">No, but thanks for the offer.</font>

116
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:37,778
<font color="yellow">- See you. - Bye.</font>

117
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:46,778
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

118
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,318
<font color="yellow">Buy me food.</font>

119
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:53,478
<font color="yellow">(Lunch available)</font>

120
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:58,778
<font color="yellow">You can eat the egg.</font>

121
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:02,378
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

122
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,148
<font color="yellow">You eat it.</font>

123
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,548
<font color="yellow">You always ate here alone,</font>

124
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:12,548
<font color="yellow">so I thought you weren't dating.</font>

125
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:15,218
<font color="yellow">But you have a beautiful girlfriend.</font>

126
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,348
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the compliment, Ma'am.</font>

127
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:21,018
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you before.</font>

128
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,478
<font color="yellow">Do you live near here?</font>

129
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,118
<font color="yellow">I live with him.</font>

130
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,888
<font color="yellow">I thought you two looked alike.</font>

131
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,418
<font color="yellow">Are you newlyweds?</font>

132
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,848
<font color="yellow">- We're more like... - Yes, we are.</font>

133
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:40,548
<font color="yellow">We got married yesterday.</font>

134
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,418
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

135
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:45,918
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go on your honeymoon?</font>

136
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,818
<font color="yellow">We need to save up.</font>

137
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,418
<font color="yellow">We'll go on our honeymoon some other time.</font>

138
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:52,218
<font color="yellow">Too bad.</font>

139
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,078
<font color="yellow">But it's good to work hard while you're still young.</font>

140
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,718
<font color="yellow">The good times will come.</font>

141
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,418
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why did you tell such a lie?</font>

142
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,888
<font color="yellow">It's not a lie. It's called role-playing.</font>

143
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,048
<font color="yellow">What if people talk about us?</font>

144
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:10,448
<font color="yellow">You're so shy and timid.</font>

145
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,518
<font color="yellow">I'll take full responsibility.</font>

146
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:19,518
<font color="yellow">I will marry you.</font>

147
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,888
<font color="yellow">Here. I like your attitude,</font>

148
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,678

149
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,888
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ma'am.</font>

150
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:45,048

157
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,248
<font color="yellow">There is no answer.</font>

158
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:26,888
<font color="yellow">She's ignoring my calls.</font>

159
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:29,818
<font color="yellow">Where on earth is she?</font>

160
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,818
<font color="yellow">He's my first love.</font>

161
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,448
<font color="yellow">I can't give up so easily.</font>

162
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:36,118
<font color="yellow">I have to muster up my courage.</font>

163
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,118
<font color="yellow">That's it. That's where she is.</font>

164
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:42,148
<font color="yellow">She's with Tae Yang.</font>

165
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,918
<font color="yellow">- Have you heard from Hyo Won? - Get me Tae Yang's address.</font>

166
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,148
<font color="yellow">- What for? - I think...</font>

167
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:52,948
<font color="yellow">she's with him.</font>

168
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:54,218
<font color="yellow">I swear that...</font>

169
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,778
<font color="yellow">he kidnapped her.</font>

170
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:57,378
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

171
00:10:57,678 --> 00:11:00,148
<font color="yellow">She left voluntarily. That's not kidnapping.</font>

172
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:02,478
<font color="yellow">He's manipulating her.</font>

173
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,318
<font color="yellow">Get me his address.</font>

174
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:06,578
<font color="yellow">You must have his resume!</font>

175
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:19,918
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

176
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,748
<font color="yellow">We spent this much on fabrics this month.</font>

177
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,948
<font color="yellow">We have to pay it by by today.</font>

178
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:27,478
<font color="yellow">Can you approve it?</font>

179
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:29,618
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll wire the money later.</font>

180
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,618
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

181
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:37,418
<font color="yellow">No, I don't have anything particular to say.</font>

182
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,818
<font color="yellow">I'm just concerned that you might be angry because of me.</font>

183
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,118
<font color="yellow">I told you that...</font>

184
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:47,278
<font color="yellow">I won't force my emotions on you.</font>

185
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:49,918
<font color="yellow">I don't want to rush you, either.</font>

186
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:53,348
<font color="yellow">I will take a step back.</font>

187
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:57,248
<font color="yellow">Take all the time you need to think and decide what you want.</font>

188
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,618
<font color="yellow">I'll respect your decision.</font>

189
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,118
<font color="yellow">Ouch!</font>

190
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:24,718
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - What's wrong?</font>

191
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,018
<font color="yellow">- Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine.</font>

192
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,518
<font color="yellow">That was close. You should be more careful.</font>

193
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,078
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

194
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:35,678
<font color="yellow">Two people made online reservations for tomorrow afternoon.</font>

195
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:36,918
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

196
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,818
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's working better than I thought.</font>

197
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:42,978
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

198
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,918
<font color="yellow">Is this Mr Lee Dong Jin from Wolgyesu Tailor Shop?</font>

199
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:47,378
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Lee Dong Jin.</font>

200
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:49,718
<font color="yellow">I'm reporter Park So Yeon with Jeil Daily News.</font>

201
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,918
<font color="yellow">I would like to write an article on you and your store,</font>

202
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:55,518
<font color="yellow">since you won the recent tailoring competition.</font>

203
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:56,748
<font color="yellow">An article?</font>

204
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,118
<font color="yellow">"Wolgyesu Tailor Shop".</font>

205
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,378
<font color="yellow">Is the door stuck?</font>

206
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,248
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

207
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,878
<font color="yellow">The door seems to be stuck.</font>

208
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:23,718
<font color="yellow">The entrance is over here.</font>

209
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,148
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

210
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:28,478
<font color="yellow">If it isn't the landlord from Jongno.</font>

211
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:31,118
<font color="yellow">I'm here to buy a suit from my brother-in-law.</font>

212
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,818
<font color="yellow">What business does a nightclub singer have here?</font>

213
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,418
<font color="yellow">"A nightclub singer"?</font>

214
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,318
<font color="yellow">The sworn brothers of this nightclub singer...</font>

215
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,848
<font color="yellow">offered to make me a bespoke suit, and that is why I am here.</font>

216
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:46,778
<font color="yellow">Wait, "offered"? Do you mean for free?</font>

217
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,018
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

218
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:52,278
<font color="yellow">My brother-in-law doesn't know how to run a business.</font>

219
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:56,378
<font color="yellow">No business does well if they give away too many freebies.</font>

220
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,348
<font color="yellow">What are you mumbling about?</font>

221
00:13:58,678 --> 00:13:59,678
<font color="yellow">Me first.</font>

222
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:04,418
<font color="yellow">He's a snake and a cheapskate.</font>

223
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:08,118
<font color="yellow">I would just love to punch him.</font>

224
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,518
<font color="yellow">Hello, my brother-in-law.</font>

225
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,578
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law?</font>

226
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,778
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? - Why else?</font>

227
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:21,648
<font color="yellow">I'm here to boost your sales.</font>

228
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,578
<font color="yellow">The store looked huge from the outside,</font>

229
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:26,418
<font color="yellow">but it's actually pretty tiny.</font>

230
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:28,218
<font color="yellow">What's the floor space?</font>

231
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:32,418
<font color="yellow">Sam Do, I'm here.</font>

232
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:33,918
<font color="yellow">You cut your hair.</font>

233
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:37,418
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law.</font>

234
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,248
<font color="yellow">I'd rather you not call me that.</font>

235
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,778
<font color="yellow">Why not? Everyone knows it's a truth and a fact...</font>

236
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,778
<font color="yellow">that I will marry Dong Sook soon.</font>

237
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,018
<font color="yellow">As someone who's lived longer and is therefore wiser,</font>

238
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,318
<font color="yellow">let me give you some advice on life.</font>

239
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:54,478
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't give things to people for free.</font>

240
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:57,018
<font color="yellow">That's the quickest way to go bankrupt.</font>

241
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:01,818
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung modelled for one of our suits at the tailoring competition,</font>

242
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,978
<font color="yellow">and the free suit is our way of thanking him.</font>

243
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,118
<font color="yellow">Is it? Okay, then, make sure...</font>

244
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:12,618
<font color="yellow">you make it quick with the cheapest materials and fabrics.</font>

245
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:15,678
<font color="yellow">Don't waste effort on a non-profit case.</font>

246
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,948
<font color="yellow">What style would you like, Sir?</font>

247
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:30,118
<font color="yellow">This is a secret, but in a few days time,</font>

248
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,118
<font color="yellow">I will propose to Dong Sook.</font>

249
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:34,418
<font color="yellow">You'll propose to her?</font>

250
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,778
<font color="yellow">It's a suit for that occasion.</font>

251
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:41,148
<font color="yellow">I want my masculinity and my sexiness...</font>

252
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,548
<font color="yellow">to stand out and create a synergy...</font>

253
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:46,018
<font color="yellow">and make an explosion of attractiveness.</font>

254
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:48,148
<font color="yellow">That's the kind of neat style I want.</font>

255
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,718
<font color="yellow">I've been a tailor for 30 years,</font>

256
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:55,548
<font color="yellow">and you're the first person to want a neat style where masculinity...</font>

257
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:59,418
<font color="yellow">and sexiness creates a synergy that makes an explosion.</font>

258
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:01,218
<font color="yellow">You don't seem confident.</font>

259
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,448
<font color="yellow">That's fine. I shouldn't have come here in the first place.</font>

260
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:06,578
<font color="yellow">What if I don't like what you make?</font>

261
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:08,778
<font color="yellow">Please watch your manners.</font>

262
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,978
<font color="yellow">He won the tailoring competition. He's a master craftsman.</font>

263
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,578
<font color="yellow">A master craftsman?</font>

264
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,618
<font color="yellow">I thought that's what people call bakers and chefs.</font>

265
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:20,048
<font color="yellow">Are there master tailors, as well?</font>

266
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,318
<font color="yellow">You may have a few buildings, but you really lack class.</font>

267
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:31,118
<font color="yellow">I left out the most important detail.</font>

268
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:35,118
<font color="yellow">How much do you think a suit like that would cost?</font>

269
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,218
<font color="yellow">That depends on the fabrics you choose.</font>

270
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:44,848
<font color="yellow">I know that, but you must have an average or an estimate.</font>

271
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:46,478
<font color="yellow">How much is that?</font>

272
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,218
<font color="yellow">This much.</font>

273
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,518
<font color="yellow">How many zeroes?</font>

274
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:03,978
<font color="yellow">(1,500 dollars)</font>

275
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:05,918
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

276
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:09,218
<font color="yellow">How inflated is this price?</font>

277
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,588
<font color="yellow">I can get a suit for 300 dollars at any market.</font>

278
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:14,278
<font color="yellow">This is five times that.</font>

279
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,588
<font color="yellow">Sam Do's suit is a work of art.</font>

280
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:20,418
<font color="yellow">Don't compare it to what they sell at markets.</font>

281
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,118
<font color="yellow">They still shouldn't charge me this much.</font>

282
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:28,018
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to bleed me dry for just one suit?</font>

283
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,148
<font color="yellow">How could you say such a thing?</font>

284
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,218
<font color="yellow">You need to make a profit, I get that.</font>

285
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,548
<font color="yellow">Give me a family member discount. I'm not paying this much.</font>

286
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:39,548
<font color="yellow">Don't expect me to pay full price when we know each other.</font>

287
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,048
<font color="yellow">- Go. - What?</font>

288
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,718
<font color="yellow">I don't want to waste my suit on someone...</font>

289
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,348
<font color="yellow">as ignorant and crass as you, so get out.</font>

290
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:53,618
<font color="yellow">What did you just say? I'm ignorant and what?</font>

291
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:58,148
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law, why did you hire someone like him?</font>

292
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:01,878
<font color="yellow">Get out of here before I beat you up and toss you out!</font>

293
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:04,878
<font color="yellow">Get up and get lost before he punches you out the window!</font>

294
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,518
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

295
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,848
<font color="yellow">Why do you always grab me by the collar?</font>

296
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:10,548
<font color="yellow">- Get lost! - You, too?</font>

297
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,848
<font color="yellow">- Let go! - Get out.</font>

298
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,478
<font color="yellow">- Calm down. - What's wrong with you?</font>

299
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:14,878
<font color="yellow">- Sam Do. - Do you have a bat?</font>

300
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,378
<font color="yellow">- Relax. - You ruffians!</font>

301
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:18,018
<font color="yellow">You scoundrels!</font>

302
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:28,588
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

303
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,248
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming. - Where to?</font>

304
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,878
<font color="yellow">Wherever it is you're going.</font>

305
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,748
<font color="yellow">It's not a place I can take you.</font>

306
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:44,218
<font color="yellow">Where are you going that I can't come along?</font>

307
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:48,478
<font color="yellow">Did you meet another old lady while you were away,</font>

308
00:18:48,478 --> 00:18:50,518
<font color="yellow">and are you visiting her every day?</font>

<font color="yellow">Not much,</font>

462
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:43,248
<font color="yellow">but I don't have the parts, so I can't fix it today.</font>

463
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:44,978
<font color="yellow">I'll have to fix it tomorrow.</font>

464
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:46,118
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow?</font>

465
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:47,948
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow?</font>

466
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:50,018
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

467
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:51,948
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep without heating.</font>

468
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,948
<font color="yellow">No, don't do that. The room's small,</font>

469
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:56,278
<font color="yellow">but sleep with me in my room.</font>

470
00:27:57,148 --> 00:28:00,148
<font color="yellow">Okay. Come back to the store for now.</font>

471
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:03,618
<font color="yellow">Can't they fix it today?</font>

472
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:06,818
<font color="yellow">The man doesn't have the parts he needs.</font>

473
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:09,078
<font color="yellow">She'll have to sleep with me.</font>

474
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:21,948
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms Choi.</font>

475
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:24,778
<font color="yellow">- Your boiler's out of order? - Yes.</font>

476
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,378
<font color="yellow">It's old and worn down.</font>

477
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:30,118
<font color="yellow">Come over to my place after work.</font>

478
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:31,678
<font color="yellow">I can't do that. It's fine.</font>

479
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,448
<font color="yellow">It's not fine.</font>

480
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:35,948
<font color="yellow">I'm weak and tired and won't repeat myself.</font>

481
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,448
<font color="yellow">You can sleep here, so come by after work.</font>

482
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:39,818
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

483
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,278
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

484
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:55,848
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

485
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:59,048
<font color="yellow">Why did you take my juice?</font>

486
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:00,378
<font color="yellow">"My juice"?</font>

487
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,578
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was about to drink it...</font>

488
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:03,878
<font color="yellow">when you took it from me.</font>

489
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:05,948
<font color="yellow">You're really thick-skinned.</font>

490
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,548
<font color="yellow">You drank two bottles of my juice already.</font>

491
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:10,678
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is this?</font>

492
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:12,078
<font color="yellow">Are you drunk?</font>

493
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,248
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable. Why is this your juice?</font>

494
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,018
<font color="yellow">- Is your name written on it? - Yes, it is.</font>

495
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,978
<font color="yellow">"Young Hee". It means bright and cheerful.</font>

496
00:29:22,248 --> 00:29:25,118
<font color="yellow">This situation isn't bright or cheerful at all.</font>

497
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:26,418
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

498
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,618
<font color="yellow">I didn't see it.</font>

499
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,878
<font color="yellow">- Are you new here? - Yes.</font>

500
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,278
<font color="yellow">You can't take other peoples' food.</font>

501
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:35,518
<font color="yellow">I could make a big deal out of this. Shall I call the police?</font>

502
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,478
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it was yours.</font>

503
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:40,548
<font color="yellow">I thought the manager stocked the fridge.</font>

504
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:42,878
<font color="yellow">I thought we pay when we leave, like in a hotel.</font>

505
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:44,848
<font color="yellow">Like in a hotel?</font>

506
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:49,448
<font color="yellow">Look around. Do you think we eat brunch here?</font>

507
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:52,278
<font color="yellow">Looks like a weirdo just moved in.</font>

508
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:54,078
<font color="yellow">A weirdo?</font>

509
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,048
<font color="yellow">Don't swear. I said I made a mistake.</font>

510
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:59,148
<font color="yellow">"Weirdo" isn't a swear word. Shall I really swear?</font>

511
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:01,378
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

512
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:04,948
<font color="yellow">I drank some juice, not knowing it was hers,</font>

513
00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:07,218
<font color="yellow">and she called me a weirdo...</font>

514
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,418
<font color="yellow">and glared at me with eyes like this.</font>

515
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:12,418
<font color="yellow">She said it was an innocent mistake.</font>

516
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,148
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have sworn.</font>

517
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,678
<font color="yellow">Manager, look. Who's older, me or her?</font>

518
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,248
<font color="yellow">Look at what she's doing, and we just met.</font>

519
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:24,548
<font color="yellow">I pay part of your salary every month.</font>

520
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:26,748
<font color="yellow">Say something. Who's older?</font>

521
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:29,118
<font color="yellow">This is a gosiwon, not a hotel.</font>

522
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:32,048
<font color="yellow">You can't eat whatever's in the fridge.</font>

523
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,218
<font color="yellow">I didn't know the rules.</font>

524
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:37,148
<font color="yellow">They're posted on the kitchen wall.</font>

525
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:39,518
<font color="yellow">Didn't you read them?</font>

526
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:44,978
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be here.</font>

527
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,448
<font color="yellow">Pack up and go home.</font>

528
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:48,618
<font color="yellow">I told you already.</font>

529
00:30:48,818 --> 00:30:51,578
<font color="yellow">I paid for three months in advance so I can't go home.</font>

530
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:53,818
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the money. Go home.</font>

531
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:56,618
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang.</font>

532
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:06,748
<font color="yellow">(Mum)</font>

533
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:19,148
<font color="yellow">(Peace Gosiwon)</font>

534
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:23,478
<font color="yellow">(Peace Gosiwon)</font>

535
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:30,618
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that this is the place?</font>

536
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,318
<font color="yellow">Yes. This is where she is, Madam.</font>

537
00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:35,878
<font color="yellow">Come with me. Let's drag her out of this place.</font>

538
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:37,448
<font color="yellow">Do not let her get away.</font>

539
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:38,678
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

540
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:41,318
<font color="yellow">This brat...</font>

541
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,648
<font color="yellow">I shall teach you a serious lesson today.</font>

542
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:53,478
<font color="yellow">Hey, Min Hyo Won!</font>

543
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:55,148
<font color="yellow">Mum, how did you know that I'm here?</font>

544
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:58,048
<font color="yellow">What do you think? My quick wits got me to where I am now.</font>

545
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:00,018
<font color="yellow">Finding out where you are is a piece of cake!</font>

546
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:02,078
<font color="yellow">This brat. This little...</font>

547
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:05,418
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

548
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:07,278
<font color="yellow">Open this.</font>

549
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:09,678
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be like this?</font>

550
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:13,048
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, why are you just standing there? Come help me open this!</font>

551
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,248
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

552
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,448
<font color="yellow">Hey, let go!</font>

553
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:21,448
<font color="yellow">Let's see who wins, you wench.</font>

554
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,348
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

555
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:27,878
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

556
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:31,378
<font color="yellow">- How have you been? - How do you think I have been?</font>

557
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:34,118
<font color="yellow">Open this now. I'll call the police if you don't.</font>

558
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:37,048
<font color="yellow">We absolutely cannot let her in. What are you doing? Help me.</font>

559
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,818
<font color="yellow">That little... Stop right there, you brat!</font>

560
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:52,448
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, go get her!</font>

561
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:53,718
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

562
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:55,618
<font color="yellow">Go away!</font>

563
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:58,548
<font color="yellow">Go away!</font>

564
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,618
<font color="yellow">- Gosh! - What is going on?</font>

565
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:07,778
<font color="yellow">You lured Hyo Won into moving out of home, didn't you?</font>

566
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:09,248
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

567
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:12,778
<font color="yellow">You punk. You stay right here.</font>

568
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,548
<font color="yellow">So? Did you get it fixed?</font>

569
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,248
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's fixed perfectly.</font>

570
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:25,918
<font color="yellow">Is it okay?</font>

571
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,948
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's fine.</font>

572
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:29,318
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

573
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:34,118
<font color="yellow">They're the highest heels I've ever seen in my whole life.</font>

574
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,348
<font color="yellow">They're probably bad for your knees. Are your knees all right?</font>

575
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:52,818
<font color="yellow">- Just a second, please. - What is it?</font>

576
00:34:58,148 --> 00:34:59,988
<font color="yellow">What's he doing with my coffee?</font>

577
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:07,578
<font color="yellow">It looked too hot, so I asked them for ice cubes.</font>

578
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:13,648
<font color="yellow">Well, it's good now.</font>

579
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:14,988
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

580
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:20,818
<font color="yellow">This must be how you approached my daughter.</font>

581
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,488
<font color="yellow">- I beg your pardon? - Didn't you cater...</font>

582
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:26,048
<font color="yellow">to all of her needs like this to seduce that naive girl?</font>

583
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:30,318
<font color="yellow">You got the wrong idea. I've never had such intention with her.</font>

584
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:33,488
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying that she's feeling that way alone?</font>

585
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:37,518
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in Ms Min that way.</font>

586
00:35:39,488 --> 00:35:42,648
<font color="yellow">You really didn't talk her into moving out of home?</font>

587
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,548
<font color="yellow">I almost fainted when I saw her at the residence this morning.</font>

588
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:48,248
<font color="yellow">So you had no idea?</font>

589
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:49,918
<font color="yellow">Not at all. Please believe me.</font>

590
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:53,378
<font color="yellow">That girl has lost her mind.</font>

591
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,518
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to send her home before the end of today,</font>

592
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:59,878
<font color="yellow">so please don't worry and wait for her at home.</font>

593
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,348
<font color="yellow">- Do you really mean it? - Yes, I do.</font>

594
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,418
<font color="yellow">If you lay even one finger on my daughter,</font>

595
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:11,118
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure that you're doomed.</font>

596
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,488
<font color="yellow">What you're worried about will not happen.</font>

597
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:19,418
<font color="yellow">Then I'll leave it in your hands...</font>

598
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:21,548
<font color="yellow">and wait for her at home.</font>

599
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:22,848
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

600
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:39,918
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

601
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,448
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

602
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:44,488
<font color="yellow">It's probably not my place to say this, but I'm just worried.</font>

603
00:36:44,778 --> 00:36:47,718
<font color="yellow">You should consider wearing heels that are about 5cm lower.</font>

604
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,148
<font color="yellow">Know your place. How dare you lecture me.</font>

605
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,148
<font color="yellow">I'm not lecturing you. I'm just worried.</font>

606
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:53,878
<font color="yellow">You're talking back again. It's rude.</font>

607
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:55,418
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

608
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:03,618
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

609
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:11,278
<font color="yellow">I was wondering whom Ms Min takes after.</font>

610
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:13,988
<font color="yellow">She's just like her mum.</font>

611
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:21,048
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.</font>

612
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:23,078
<font color="yellow">You're not inconveniencing us at all.</font>

613
00:37:23,378 --> 00:37:25,748
<font color="yellow">You're like family to us.</font>

614
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:28,948
<font color="yellow">That's right. Make yourself at home here.</font>

615
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:32,578
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, shall we sleep together in the room my mum and I share?</font>

616
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:35,118
<font color="yellow">- Shall I? - It's too small for three people.</font>

617
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:37,548
<font color="yellow">I'll just sleep in Mum and Dad's room.</font>

618
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:38,878
<font color="yellow">You can sleep in my room.</font>

619
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:41,048
<font color="yellow">Your room?</font>

620
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:42,348
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

621
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:45,848
<font color="yellow">I want to sleep beside Mum and Dad.</font>

622
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:50,278
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. How long has it been?</font>

623
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:52,518
<font color="yellow">I can't even remember the last time you slept beside me.</font>

624
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:56,248
<font color="yellow">Look at you smiling from ear to ear. Are you that happy?</font>

625
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:58,218
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm happy.</font>

626
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,118
<font color="yellow">Dad, aren't you jealous?</font>

627
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:04,018
<font color="yellow">Mum loves Dong Jin more than you.</font>

628
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:05,548
<font color="yellow">What's there to be jealous about?</font>

629
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:08,988
<font color="yellow">It's normal for women to be more infatuated with younger men.</font>

630
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:16,678
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you not seeing Mr Park for dinner today?</font>

631
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:20,348
<font color="yellow">He pestered me about meeting up, but I said no.</font>

632
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:21,518
<font color="yellow">Why did you say no?</font>

633
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:23,618
<font color="yellow">The more I get to know him, the more obnoxious I think he is.</font>

634
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:26,018
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? Why do you think he's obnoxious?</font>

635
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,948
<font color="yellow">He makes so much noise when he eats,</font>

636
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:31,248
<font color="yellow">and I hate how he touches everything on the table with his chopsticks.</font>

637
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:32,718
<font color="yellow">I hate it so much.</font>

638
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:36,118
<font color="yellow">When he talks, he licks his lips like a pervert.</font>

639
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:40,078
<font color="yellow">Also, I guess he wears trousers that are too tight. When he walks,</font>

640
00:38:40,878 --> 00:38:42,918
<font color="yellow">he keeps touching the front, which turns me off.</font>

641
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:46,278
<font color="yellow">And I don't know why he shudders whenever any money issue comes up.</font>

642
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:49,118
<font color="yellow">You're just too spoiled.</font>

643
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:52,778
<font color="yellow">Stop complaining and set a date for us to meet his parents next week.</font>

644
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:54,848
<font color="yellow">I don't want that.</font>

645
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:58,778
<font color="yellow">Stop pushing ahead with it, Honey. You should listen to Dong Sook.</font>

646
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:02,678
<font color="yellow">Dad is right, Mum. He sure seems like a handful.</font>

647
00:39:02,678 --> 00:39:04,548
<font color="yellow">Everyone has flaws.</font>

648
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:08,118
<font color="yellow">All married couples understand each other's flaws...</font>

649
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:10,518
<font color="yellow">and help each other. That's what marriage is.</font>

650
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:14,148
<font color="yellow">I'm really fine alone. Dong Jin should get married first.</font>

651
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:16,718
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about all of a sudden, Dong Sook?</font>

652
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:18,718
<font color="yellow">Don't even worry about Dong Jin.</font>

653
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:20,948
<font color="yellow">Women are lining up to have their daughters set up with him.</font>

654
00:39:20,948 --> 00:39:22,148
<font color="yellow">Seriously, Grandma?</font>

655
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:25,988
<font color="yellow">Of course. Your uncle is such a great catch.</font>

656
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:29,518
<font color="yellow">Many smart young ladies from good families want to meet him.</font>

657
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,718
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing me, Mum.</font>

658
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:44,148
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this place is huge. I've never been to a place like this.</font>

659
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:45,448
<font color="yellow">Me, neither.</font>

660
00:39:52,078 --> 00:39:54,148
<font color="yellow">- Let's just leave. - Why? No.</font>

661
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:56,718
<font color="yellow">We came all the way here. Why do you want to leave already?</font>

662
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,748
<font color="yellow">We have to cheer for Jun when he performs.</font>

663
00:39:58,748 --> 00:40:01,548
<font color="yellow">All right. Then let's just stay for one performance of his.</font>

664
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:02,718
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

665
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:07,648
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

666
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,118
<font color="yellow">What? What was I doing?</font>

667
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:11,548
<font color="yellow">What would you like for drinks and food?</font>

668
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,018
<font color="yellow">Are five beers and a fruit platter enough for the minimum spend?</font>

669
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:17,148
<font color="yellow">Yes. Certainly, Ma'am.</font>

670
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:19,618
<font color="yellow">- We'll get that, then. - Sure. I'll be right back.</font>

671
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:24,988
<font color="yellow">Honey, have you been here before by any chance?</font>

672
00:40:26,148 --> 00:40:28,488
<font color="yellow">- No. - Then how do you know...</font>

673
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:31,018
<font color="yellow">what the minimum spend for the table is?</font>

674
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:35,748
<font color="yellow">Jun told me. I spoke to him on the phone earlier today.</font>

675
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,648
<font color="yellow">Jun told you?</font>

676
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:40,678
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

677
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:48,148
<font color="yellow">Next up is the former prince of rock ballads...</font>

678
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:50,988
<font color="yellow">who made a surprising comeback as a trot singer.</font>

679
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:53,078
<font color="yellow">Let's welcome Tae Pyung to the stage.</font>

680
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:55,848
<font color="yellow">Please give him a big round of applause.</font>

681
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:01,318
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung, Tae Pyung!</font>

682
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:02,848
<font color="yellow">Go,Tae Pyung!</font>

683
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:06,278
<font color="yellow">Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I'm the intellectual, sexy...</font>

684
00:41:06,278 --> 00:41:08,048
<font color="yellow">and charismatic singer who is now known...</font>

685
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:11,878
<font color="yellow">as the gentleman of trot music, Tae Pyung. Nice to meet you.</font>

686
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,778
<font color="yellow">I hope all of you enjoy your night.</font>

687
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:17,518
<font color="yellow">Did you see him doing this?</font>

688
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:22,618
<font color="yellow">The last farewell on the two-lined bridge</font>

689
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,648
<font color="yellow">Even the wind that brushes my skin</font>

690
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:28,348
<font color="yellow">- Breaks my heart - He's really good, isn't he?</font>

691
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:29,748
<font color="yellow">He's not half bad.</font>

692
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:33,218
<font color="yellow">- Why can't I stop you? - Let's take a picture.</font>

693
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:34,848
<font color="yellow">I'm just standing here</font>

694
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:41,018
<font color="yellow">All I can do is cry</font>

695
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:46,448
<font color="yellow">I can't cross the bridge</font>

696
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:50,078
<font color="yellow">- That's all I can think - Look over here.</font>

697
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:53,648
<font color="yellow">I can't take my foot off to cross the bridge</font>

698
00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:54,948
<font color="yellow">Shall we dance?</font>

699
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:58,378
<font color="yellow">- I look back - For just one song, then.</font>

700
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:02,118
<font color="yellow">And I look at your face</font>

701
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:07,918
<font color="yellow">I feel stupid for not holding on to you</font>

702
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:09,118
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

703
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:15,648
<font color="yellow">At the end of the two-lined bridge</font>

704
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:17,648
<font color="yellow">We called out</font>

705
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:20,988
<font color="yellow">- each other's names - Would you dance with me next?</font>

706
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:22,018
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

707
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:25,418
<font color="yellow">- We're too - I'd like to dance with you next.</font>

708
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:28,678
<font color="yellow">Far apart</font>

709
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:32,988
<font color="yellow">I can't hear you</font>

710
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:39,748
<font color="yellow">I wish the bridge breaks down</font>

711
00:42:40,148 --> 00:42:45,948
<font color="yellow">So I won't be able to cross</font>

712
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:49,448
<font color="yellow">My heart is in pain</font>

713
00:42:49,848 --> 00:42:52,488
<font color="yellow">Our love</font>

714
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:59,248
<font color="yellow">Is not meant to be</font>

715
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,778
<font color="yellow">Go, Leather Jacket. Encore!</font>

716
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:31,718
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

717
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,318
<font color="yellow">Hey, Leather Jacket.</font>

718
00:43:35,718 --> 00:43:36,848
<font color="yellow">Way to go.</font>

719
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:39,548
<font color="yellow">You have the voice, the body and the face for it.</font>

720
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:41,018
<font color="yellow">You've got the whole package.</font>

721
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,678
<font color="yellow">I should bring Dong Jin and Tae Yang next time.</font>

722
00:43:44,018 --> 00:43:48,148
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sam Do. That really makes me feel good.</font>

723
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:49,848
<font color="yellow">You did good.</font>

724
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:51,848
<font color="yellow">Why is Sun Nyeo...</font>

725
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,478
<font color="yellow">taking so long in the bathroom?</font>

726
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:54,918
<font color="yellow">She must be constipated.</font>

727
00:43:56,878 --> 00:43:58,418
<font color="yellow">She didn't go to the bathroom.</font>

728
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:02,578
<font color="yellow">Can you guess where she is? Oh, she's over there.</font>

729
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:08,278
<font color="yellow">She's a natural.</font>

730
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,278
<font color="yellow">I didn't know she was such a good dancer.</font>

731
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:20,948
<font color="yellow">Look at her moves.</font>

732
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:23,018
<font color="yellow">Has she gone out of her mind?</font>

733
00:44:25,778 --> 00:44:27,648
<font color="yellow">This is not looking good.</font>

734
00:44:33,218 --> 00:44:35,548
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - You promised me that...</font>

735
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,478
<font color="yellow">you'll let me have the honour next time.</font>

736
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:40,578
<font color="yellow">I'm going first.</font>

737
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:44,378
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I came with someone. This will have to do for today.</font>

738
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:46,548
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

739
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:48,478
<font color="yellow">You promised that you'd hold my hands.</font>

740
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:49,718
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

741
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:57,618
<font color="yellow">- What? - Get over here.</font>

742
00:44:58,018 --> 00:44:59,518
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

743
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:02,018
<font color="yellow">Are your hands some kind of a bus strap?</font>

744
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:03,378
<font color="yellow">You let this man and that man hold your hands.</font>

745
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:05,248
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

746
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:08,048
<font color="yellow">I was going to dance for just one song,</font>

747
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,678
<font color="yellow">but I haven't danced for years.</font>

748
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:12,448
<font color="yellow">I guess I got carried away.</font>

749
00:45:12,518 --> 00:45:14,918
<font color="yellow">You said it was your first time at a cabaret.</font>

750
00:45:15,148 --> 00:45:17,278
<font color="yellow">When we sold chicken at the Central Market,</font>

751
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:19,948
<font color="yellow">I went with other shop owners...</font>

752
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:22,918
<font color="yellow">on our off-days to have some fun.</font>

753
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:26,878
<font color="yellow">And you lied to me saying it was your first time?</font>

754
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:32,148
<font color="yellow">You would've never known if I contained myself.</font>

755
00:45:32,418 --> 00:45:36,048
<font color="yellow">Those people went crazy over me and didn't let go of me.</font>

756
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:37,418
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

757
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:40,848
<font color="yellow">If I catch you going there again, I won't let it slip like this time.</font>

758
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:43,618
<font color="yellow">Are you being jealous?</font>

759
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:45,478
<font color="yellow">Nonsense.</font>

760
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:50,518
<font color="yellow">Was it that shocking to see all those men begging me to...</font>

761
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,018
<font color="yellow">hold their hands?</font>

762
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:53,918
<font color="yellow">Not a chance.</font>

763
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:56,078
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to hold your hands?</font>

764
00:45:56,148 --> 00:45:58,078
<font color="yellow">- Shall we dance? - I'll pass.</font>

765
00:45:58,648 --> 00:45:59,848
<font color="yellow">Follow my lead.</font>

766
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:02,818
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

767
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:04,978
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

768
00:46:05,078 --> 00:46:06,418
<font color="yellow">I said I'm fine.</font>

769
00:46:07,618 --> 00:46:08,918
<font color="yellow">Social dancing...</font>

770
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:12,148
<font color="yellow">is good for blood circulation, your heart and lungs.</font>

771
00:46:12,278 --> 00:46:13,978
<font color="yellow">It's good for relieving stress.</font>

772
00:46:15,048 --> 00:46:17,948
<font color="yellow">I know that you were under tremendous amount of stress lately.</font>

773
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:20,948
<font color="yellow">A little dance will make it all go away.</font>

774
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:22,918
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

775
00:46:23,278 --> 00:46:24,648
<font color="yellow">How does it go exactly?</font>

776
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:26,318
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you.</font>

777
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,218
<font color="yellow">Do as I show you.</font>

778
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:31,718
<font color="yellow">- Give me your hand. - My hand?</font>

779
00:46:31,778 --> 00:46:34,048
<font color="yellow">Yes, your hand. There you go.</font>

780
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,648
<font color="yellow">Now, let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

781
00:46:39,778 --> 00:46:42,518
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

782
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:45,318
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

783
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:48,118
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

784
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:51,318
<font color="yellow">You're pretty good. Are you sure this is your first time?</font>

785
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,848
<font color="yellow">Am I really that good?</font>

786
00:47:00,148 --> 00:47:03,248
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

787
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:06,078
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

788
00:47:06,148 --> 00:47:08,978
<font color="yellow">Go, 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

789
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:43,878
<font color="yellow">- You're home late. - Yes.</font>

790
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,048
<font color="yellow">I had to fill in for my senior.</font>

791
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:50,518
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the food yesterday.</font>

792
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:54,578
<font color="yellow">It didn't mean anything. Yesterday, we had a party without you.</font>

793
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:57,518
<font color="yellow">- I just wanted you to have a taste. - I see.</font>

794
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:00,948
<font color="yellow">I'm just very grateful that you still care about...</font>

795
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:02,618
<font color="yellow">someone like me.</font>

796
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,318
<font color="yellow">- Next week is the family meeting. - A family meeting?</font>

797
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:10,978
<font color="yellow">Mr Park's father and my family will be meeting together.</font>

798
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:14,378
<font color="yellow">When the parents come to an agreement,</font>

799
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:17,148
<font color="yellow">the marriage will take place in no time.</font>

800
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:19,818
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything to say to me?</font>

801
00:48:22,018 --> 00:48:23,448
<font color="yellow">How could I say anything to you?</font>

802
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:25,818
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling a bit tired. I have to go inside.</font>

803
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:28,878
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

804
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:36,678
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sung Jun?</font>

805
00:48:38,718 --> 00:48:39,978
<font color="yellow">Do you want some baked sweet potatoes?</font>

806
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,918
<font color="yellow">I bought some on my way home. It's still hot.</font>

807
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:45,448
<font color="yellow">You should have some.</font>

808
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:50,878
<font color="yellow">I don't want any. I didn't ask for this.</font>

809
00:48:56,148 --> 00:48:58,478
<font color="yellow">I even kept it under my coat to keep it from getting cold.</font>

810
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:00,718
<font color="yellow">You should eat it when it's hot.</font>

811
00:49:10,118 --> 00:49:11,818
<font color="yellow">Do you need something?</font>

812
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,348
<font color="yellow">Not really. She's taking quite a long time to do the dishes.</font>

813
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:21,148
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is washing all the rusty pots and pans.</font>

814
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,818
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say to Yun Shil?</font>

815
00:49:25,248 --> 00:49:26,778
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

816
00:49:38,118 --> 00:49:39,778
<font color="yellow">Why does she always go out of her way?</font>

817
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:44,278
<font color="yellow">Why is she doing that? She should get more sleep.</font>

818
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:52,548
<font color="yellow">I wonder if my mum cleaned this room.</font>

819
00:49:57,878 --> 00:49:59,018
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

820
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:32,148
<font color="yellow">I made your bed.</font>

821
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:34,018
<font color="yellow">You should get some sleep. You look tired.</font>

822
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:36,678
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for bothering you.</font>

823
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:40,118
<font color="yellow">I don't mind sleeping on an electric mat at home.</font>

824
00:50:40,778 --> 00:50:42,148
<font color="yellow">Since you were here before,</font>

825
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:44,048
<font color="yellow">you know where my room is, right?</font>

826
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:45,678
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

827
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,018
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

828
00:51:06,548 --> 00:51:07,648
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep.</font>

829
00:51:57,118 --> 00:52:00,848
<font color="yellow">He wasn't lying when said he studied hard. Look at all these books.</font>

830
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:03,718
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of books in different languages.</font>

831
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:19,378
<font color="yellow">He looks way different from how he looks now.</font>

832
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:21,618
<font color="yellow">He was a handsome little boy.</font>

833
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,818
<font color="yellow">He looks like a cute little chick.</font>

834
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:56,148
<font color="yellow">Why does he still have his wedding pictures when he got divorced?</font>

835
00:53:24,778 --> 00:53:27,748
<font color="yellow">Give me a big smile.</font>

836
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:31,818
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

837
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:34,578
<font color="yellow">I've been doing this for 30 years now.</font>

838
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,318
<font color="yellow">But I've never seen a couple looking this uneasy.</font>

839
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:40,048
<font color="yellow">Can the bride stand up for me?</font>

840
00:53:41,978 --> 00:53:43,378
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

841
00:53:46,218 --> 00:53:48,048
<font color="yellow">Do you hate marrying me that much?</font>

842
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:49,548
<font color="yellow">Try putting on a smile.</font>

843
00:53:51,378 --> 00:53:52,718
<font color="yellow">I'm trying.</font>

844
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:56,118
<font color="yellow">You should try, too.</font>

845
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:57,918
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

846
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:01,148
<font color="yellow">I'm trying, too, but it's not working.</font>

847
00:54:05,478 --> 00:54:07,218
<font color="yellow">I guess we're meant for each other.</font>

848
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,778
<font color="yellow">Neither of us has a good poker face.</font>

849
00:54:13,148 --> 00:54:16,848
<font color="yellow">I'll take the picture now. In 1, 2.</font>

850
00:54:20,718 --> 00:54:22,218
<font color="yellow">I must be getting old,</font>

851
00:54:22,748 --> 00:54:24,678
<font color="yellow">seeing that I'm thinking of the past.</font>

852
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:53,848
<font color="yellow">Come on out.</font>

853
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:57,378
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

854
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:12,378
<font color="yellow">The door.</font>

855
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:23,278
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go home.</font>

856
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:25,278
<font color="yellow">I made a promise with Ms Choi.</font>

857
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:28,948
<font color="yellow">You should go back if you don't want her to think I'm a liar.</font>

858
00:55:30,418 --> 00:55:32,118
<font color="yellow">Then promise me one thing.</font>

859
00:55:32,678 --> 00:55:34,818
<font color="yellow">- What? - Don't ignore my calls.</font>

860
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:39,148
<font color="yellow">You have to answer my calls when and wherever you are.</font>

861
00:55:47,918 --> 00:55:48,918
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

862
00:55:55,678 --> 00:55:57,548
<font color="yellow">I'll answer your calls. Can you go inside now?</font>

863
00:55:57,748 --> 00:55:59,018
<font color="yellow">There's one other thing.</font>

864
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:02,648
<font color="yellow">Stop calling me Ms Min from now on.</font>

865
00:56:02,848 --> 00:56:04,648
<font color="yellow">Call me by my name.</font>

866
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:09,678
<font color="yellow">You're awfully demanding for someone being asked to go back home.</font>

867
00:56:09,878 --> 00:56:11,448
<font color="yellow">We don't even work together.</font>

868
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:14,548
<font color="yellow">It's weird how you keep calling me "Ms Min".</font>

869
00:56:16,818 --> 00:56:18,248
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can do that.</font>

870
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:20,818
<font color="yellow">Unless I'm really close with someone,</font>

871
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,318
<font color="yellow">I can't call a person by their first name.</font>

872
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:29,618
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

873
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,018
<font color="yellow">Give it a try, then.</font>

874
00:56:37,618 --> 00:56:38,618
<font color="yellow">I'll do it later.</font>

875
00:56:38,618 --> 00:56:41,348
<font color="yellow">Call my name.</font>

876
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:42,718
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

877
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:45,748
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

878
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:48,848
<font color="yellow">Can you look over there for a second?</font>

879
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:02,748
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

880
00:57:03,978 --> 00:57:08,078
<font color="yellow">My name sounds so pretty when you say it.</font>

881
00:57:09,978 --> 00:57:11,718
<font color="yellow">It's getting late. You should go inside.</font>

882
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:25,078
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

883
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,648
<font color="yellow">Get back inside right now!</font>

884
00:57:36,548 --> 00:57:38,578
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to embarrass me?</font>

885
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:44,578
<font color="yellow">Drive safely, Honey.</font>

886
00:58:16,848 --> 00:58:18,148
<font color="yellow">What are you doing at my house?</font>

887
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:23,818
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way back after taking Ms Min home.</font>

888
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:28,648
<font color="yellow">Why are you approaching my sister?</font>

889
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:32,278
<font color="yellow">Is this your way of getting back at me for stealing your girlfriend?</font>

890
00:58:32,478 --> 00:58:34,278
<font color="yellow">You're using her, aren't you?</font>

891
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:38,748
<font color="yellow">I'm not low like you.</font>

892
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:41,848
<font color="yellow">I don't play with other people's feelings.</font>

893
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:43,778
<font color="yellow">Why you little...</font>

894
00:58:52,848 --> 00:58:56,048
<font color="yellow">I'll let you off the hook because you were once my boss.</font>

895
00:58:58,078 --> 00:59:00,018
<font color="yellow">But I hope you watch your behaviour next time.</font>

896
00:59:27,448 --> 00:59:30,478
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to start family with that Tae Yang boy.</font>

897
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:31,948
<font color="yellow">Why did you come back home?</font>

898
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:33,378
<font color="yellow">I wanted to do that,</font>

899
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,748
<font color="yellow">but my Tae Yang is very up-right.</font>

900
00:59:37,048 --> 00:59:39,148
<font color="yellow">He kept refusing, so I had no choice.</font>

901
00:59:39,148 --> 00:59:40,518
<font color="yellow">"My Tae Yang"?</font>

902
00:59:41,448 --> 00:59:43,678
<font color="yellow">"My Tae Yang"?</font>

903
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:47,348
<font color="yellow">Do you have any idea what you put me through?</font>

904
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:49,848
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to make the same mistake as you.</font>

905
00:59:50,248 --> 00:59:52,978
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'm going to marry someone I love.</font>

906
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:56,048
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to pick money over love.</font>

907
00:59:57,418 --> 00:59:58,978
<font color="yellow">Is that any way of talking to your mother?</font>

908
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:00,818
<font color="yellow">You witch.</font>

909
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:04,278
<font color="yellow">How dare you! You little brat.</font>

910
01:00:05,148 --> 01:00:07,548
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Mum.</font>

911
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:09,578
<font color="yellow">- What did you say about me? - What's wrong?</font>

912
01:00:09,878 --> 01:00:12,448
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. Let go! - Take it easy, Mum.</font>

913
01:00:12,548 --> 01:00:14,218

919
01:00:48,018 --> 01:00:49,578
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, it did.</font>

920
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,348
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you what it was about?</font>

921
01:00:51,578 --> 01:00:53,248
<font color="yellow">It's nothing serious.</font>

922
01:00:53,748 --> 01:00:55,418
<font color="yellow">There was a small incident at home.</font>

923
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,618
<font color="yellow">You said she also works at Meesa Apparel, right?</font>

924
01:00:58,718 --> 01:01:01,378

929

<font color="yellow">What about you? Why are you out?</font>

930
01:02:03,648 --> 01:02:06,318
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep thinking about this and that.</font>

936

941
01:02:40,618 --> 01:02:43,518
<font color="yellow">It's not entirely about that.</font>

942

<font color="yellow">I didn't want to rush into decisions this time.</font>

948
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:02,548
<font color="yellow">I thought a lot before I said what I said.</font>

949
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:04,578
<font color="yellow">So now,</font>

950
01:03:05,018 --> 01:03:07,278
<font color="yellow">it's your turn to think.</font>

951

<font color="yellow">It looks like...</font>

958
01:03:45,848 --> 01:03:48,318
<font color="yellow">I do many things for the first time with you.</font>

959

965
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:16,878

<font color="yellow">The truth is,</font>

973
01:04:42,118 --> 01:04:43,848
<font color="yellow">it was my first time, too.</font>

974
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:47,148
<font color="yellow">It was my first time hearing a proper love confession.</font>

975
