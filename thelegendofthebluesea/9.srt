56
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,470
<font color="yellow">Did you also plan to go after him far away?</font>

57
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,440
<font color="yellow">Why? Did he ask you to go far away and eat ramyun with him?</font>

58
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,860
<font color="yellow">It wasn't Jeong Hoon who cooked me ramyeon.</font>

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,560
<font color="yellow">Do you mean.. he isn't that guy?</font>

60
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,770
<font color="yellow">Then who is that guy?</font>

61
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,330
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you that.</font>

62
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,530
<font color="yellow">This won't do, you follow me.</font>

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,130
<font color="yellow">- Look here, see there are lots of dolls right? <br> -Yeah.</font>

64
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,840
<font color="yellow">Pick one.</font>

65
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,660
<font color="yellow">I choose that pink octopus.</font>

66
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,340
<font color="yellow">Okay, you chose the pink octopus, right?</font>

67
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,790
<font color="yellow">That's what you chose, so you have to pick out that one no matter what.</font>

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,260
<font color="yellow">Here, try it.</font>

69
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,470
<font color="yellow">I did it!</font>

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,650
<font color="yellow">I almost did it though.</font>

71
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,290
<font color="yellow">You're right, it almost came out right? But it didn't actually come all the way out, you know.</font>

72
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,410
<font color="yellow">Life is naturally all about something that is about to work out but then it may not.</font>

73
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,090
<font color="yellow">But if you give up here,</font>

74
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,400
<font color="yellow">then that pink octopus that you chose will never be able to come out.</font>

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,990
<font color="yellow">Try it again.</font>

76
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,200
<font color="yellow">I guess it's not working.</font>

77
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,400
<font color="yellow">You're trying to give up like that again?</font>

78
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,340
<font color="yellow">If you decided, you can't give up until it's become yours.</font>

79
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,980
<font color="yellow">Whether that's the pink octopus,</font>

80
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,110
<font color="yellow">or anything.</font>

81
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,530
<font color="yellow">Then I'll try again one more time.</font>

82
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,660
<font color="yellow">- Hey, now- <br> - Wait, stay there.</font>

83
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,430
<font color="yellow">Ah it almost did it.</font>

84
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,570
<font color="yellow">From what I see, there's something wrong with the machine.</font>

85
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,290
<font color="yellow">It looks like they loosened the claw on purpose. Let's just go.</font>

86
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,250
<font color="yellow">Then give up?</font>

87
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,190
<font color="yellow">No. This isn't giving up, this is stopping for a bit.</font>

88
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,630
<font color="yellow">Until next time?</font>

89
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,160
<font color="yellow">Of course. How are you so smart now, it's been a while..?</font>

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,260
<font color="yellow">Anyway, the important thing is that you should never give up on what you've chosen.</font>

91
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,570
<font color="yellow">Should you give up, or shouldn't you?</font>

92
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,060
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't.</font>

93
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

94
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,630
<font color="yellow">Would you like to go and eat some sticky flat bun?</font>

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, I told you not to go, but you didn't listen to me.</font>

96
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,590
<font color="yellow">Something serious almost happened!</font>

97
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,920
<font color="yellow">I said I'm okay.</font>

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,880
<font color="yellow">Who on earth was it? Did you see his face?</font>

99
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,870
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

100
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,190
<font color="yellow">Anyone that comes to mind?</font>

101
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,670
<font color="yellow">Well, since we have so many enemies,</font>

102
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,970
<font color="yellow">I can't narrow it down quickly.</font>

103
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,510
<font color="yellow"><i>He was spotted by the police patrolling Hoehyeon-dong,</i></font>

104
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,890
<font color="yellow"><i>and the chase began during the daylight.</i></font>

105
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,070
<font color="yellow">It's that person.</font>

107
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,880
<font color="yellow">It's that person?</font>

108
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,820
<font color="yellow">The escaped prisoner? Ma Dae Young?</font>

109
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right. It's him.</font>

110
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,680
<font color="yellow">He took his hat off today.</font>

111
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,410
<font color="yellow">Cheong, do you remember him, too?</font>

112
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,650
<font color="yellow">It's that person, right? The one who was wearing the police uniform and cap when it was raining before.</font>

113
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,260
<font color="yellow">He wore a police cap and also a black cap.</font>

114
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,160
<font color="yellow">You... Have you seen him after that day?</font>

115
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, when I was passing out the flyer.</font>

116
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,070
<font color="yellow">Whoa! I am so shocked so many times. Do you see the goosebumps?</font>

117
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,380
<font color="yellow">Then, the escapee was tailing our Cheong? Why?</font>

118
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,990
<font color="yellow">If something like that happened, you should have told me!</font>

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
<font color="yellow">Are you a fool?</font>

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,390
<font color="yellow">Cheong wouldn't have known, either. You just found out, too. Why are you blaming her?</font>

121
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,670
<font color="yellow">Ah, that punk. He is just acting up for no good reason.</font>

122
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,540
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's cold. What are you doing there? Come on in.</font>

123
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,910
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

124
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,760
<font color="yellow">Why would that jerk be tailing Cheong?</font>

125
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,290
<font color="yellow">Did he just follow Cheong? He called you out and almost killed you.</font>

126
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,470
<font color="yellow">Something serious really could have happened to you!</font>

127
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,700
<font color="yellow">So, that's what I'm saying. Why would that jerk follow Cheong...</font>

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,220
<font color="yellow"><i>The fate in this world is continuing in that world.</i></font>

129
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,920
<font color="yellow"><i>It's the same way for the ill-fate.</i></font>

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,330
<font color="yellow">Hyung.</font>

132
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

133
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,420
<font color="yellow">Don't take it the wrong way.</font>

134
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,990
<font color="yellow">I had a dream.</font>

135
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,010
<font color="yellow">A dream?</font>

136
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,940
<font color="yellow">In that dream, I was living in the Joseon period.</font>

137
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,530
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

138
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,430
<font color="yellow">And I was wearing that bracelet.</font>

139
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,680
<font color="yellow">The bracelet? You mean Kim Dam Ryeong's bracelet?</font>

140
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,450
<font color="yellow">Ah, so you were Kim Dam Ryeong in the dream?</font>

141
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,740
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

142
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,930
<font color="yellow">I believe I was.</font>

143
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,990
<font color="yellow">It's possible. After seeing the movie The Admiral: Roaring Currents, I had a dream where I was Admiral Yi in it.</font>

144
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,740
<font color="yellow">Aish, I'm not talking about that kind of non-sense dream.</font>

145
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,930
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking. Your dream is the non-sense one. How could you be Kim Dam Ryeong?</font>

146
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,570
<font color="yellow">Is it like you're looking back at your past life?</font>

147
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,180
<font color="yellow">It's not like it's my past life, but I feel like I'm looking at a parallel universe.</font>

148
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,910
<font color="yellow">- Myself in another universe.<br>- You in another universe, my butt!</font>

149
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,950
<font color="yellow">It's because I've been talking to you about the bracelet,</font>

150
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,800
<font color="yellow">and Si Ah told you about the excavation from the shipwreck. That's why you're having this non-sense dream.</font>

151
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,990
<font color="yellow">The reality is governing your dream. You're the one who studied neurosciences. How can you not realize it?</font>

152
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,840
<font color="yellow">- Ah, is it like that?<br>- Of course, it is.</font>

153
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,900
<font color="yellow">Ah. I've been kind of off recently.</font>

154
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,390
<font color="yellow">Hey, it is natural</font>

155
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,180
<font color="yellow">to have weird dreams before your big projects.</font>

156
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,330
<font color="yellow">It must be a sign that our Project Ahn Jin Joo will be a big success.</font>

157
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,840
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

158
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, that girl named Seo Yuna.</font>

159
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,350
<font color="yellow">It seems like that girl and my Elizabeth had some troubles.</font>

160
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,450
<font color="yellow">You know girls like that always stand out not in a good way.</font>

161
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,680
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Did you get a call from her mom? Why?</font>

162
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,870
<font color="yellow">She asked to have her included in our swim team?</font>

163
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,360
<font color="yellow">Well... Will you let her in?</font>

164
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,670
<font color="yellow">Of course not. That's right.</font>

165
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,230
<font color="yellow">When there are kids like that in the mix, it's always our kids who suffer.</font>

166
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,530
<font color="yellow">Of course, I trust you. Then...</font>

167
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,220
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's talk details when we meet.</font>

168
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,260
<font color="yellow">Okay, yes. Bye!</font>

169
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,720
<font color="yellow">You were on the phone for 1.5 hours but you didn't discuss the details?</font>

170
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,950
<font color="yellow">Honey,</font>

171
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,580
<font color="yellow">did you get to talk to Chairman Heo?</font>

172
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,100
<font color="yellow">Well. I invited him to a dinner, but he acts all busy and doesn't set up the time.</font>

173
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,970
<font color="yellow">Omo, I've been providing endless supply of banchan <i>(side dishes)</i> for him</font>

174
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,440
<font color="yellow">since I was told he liked them.</font>

175
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,790
<font color="yellow">Is it like dine and dash? What's wrong with them?</font>

176
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,470
<font color="yellow">He's not an easy guy. If there's anything of investment value, he'd do that himself and won't give them to us.</font>

177
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,020
<font color="yellow">That's why we're trying this hard</font>

178
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,500
<font color="yellow">so he could share some of them, no?</font>

179
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,130
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

180
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,990
<font color="yellow">It's been so hard to put aside that secret fund.</font>

181
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,320
<font color="yellow">I was so careful not to get caught on by the external audits or the National Tax Services.</font>

182
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,170
<font color="yellow">We saved it up by working up our blood and sweat.</font>

183
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,960
<font color="yellow">Of course we have. If you call this black money,</font>

184
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,580
<font color="yellow">I feel wronged. I worked very hard for that money!</font>

185
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,130
<font color="yellow">Preach, honey!</font>

186
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,660
<font color="yellow">You've worked so hard. We really</font>

187
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,990
<font color="yellow">invest this money well</font>

188
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,890
<font color="yellow">and won't let your efforts</font>

189
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,560
<font color="yellow">go to waste.</font>

190
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, honey. Let's give our best tonight as well!</font>

191
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,870
<font color="yellow">Say what?</font>

192
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,640
<font color="yellow">- Who's it?<br><i>- Korea Post. Is Ms. Kang Seo Hee available?</i></font>

193
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,120
<font color="yellow"><i>It's court registered mail, so she has to accept it herself.</i></font>

194
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,060
<font color="yellow">How dare you show up here. Are you crazy?</font>

195
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,410
<font color="yellow">It's not like I wanted to. I am cold, hungry, and out of money.</font>

196
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,670
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae is not an easy target. He wiggles his way out every time.</font>

197
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:14,500
<font color="yellow">Chairman Heo is trying to set up meetings with his lawyers to legalize his will.</font>

198
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,310
<font color="yellow">Will you get your sense back after I lost everything?</font>

199
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,800
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do if Chairman Heo go meet Joon Jae and give all his fortune to him?</font>

200
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,060
<font color="yellow">Hurry and leave now.</font>

201
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,340
<font color="yellow">- Sorry about the trouble at this late hour.<br>- No problem.</font>

202
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,040
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

203
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,500
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

204
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,710
<font color="yellow">Oh, Chi Hyeon.</font>

205
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,360
<font color="yellow">Do they deliver at this late hour?</font>

206
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,590
<font color="yellow">That's what I wondering. He must be behind his schedule due to busy year-end season.</font>

207
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,450
<font color="yellow">- Have you eaten?<br>- Yes, I have.</font>

208
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,720
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,060
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten, Mother?</font>

210
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,230
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

211
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,860
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

212
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,640
<font color="yellow">Mother, Did you hear about Joon Jae, by any chance?</font>

213
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,160
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

214
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,290
<font color="yellow">I ran into him recently. By pure luck.</font>

215
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, you did?</font>

216
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,360
<font color="yellow">Did you tell your father?</font>

217
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,860
<font color="yellow">Of course not. I'm telling you first.</font>

218
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,130
<font color="yellow">Good job. He's been under stress for a few things recently.</font>

219
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,070
<font color="yellow">I think it will be better that you don't tell him that for a while.</font>

220
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,340
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you know already?</font>

221
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,120
<font color="yellow">- What?<br> - Where Joon Jae lives</font>

222
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,700
<font color="yellow">and how he is.</font>

223
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,820
<font color="yellow">I told you already that I don't know.</font>

224
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,820
<font color="yellow">Then why won't you ask me more about him? Aren't you curious since I met him?</font>

225
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,610
<font color="yellow">Your farther and I</font>

226
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,670
<font color="yellow">have huge scars we got from Joon Jae.</font>

227
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,030
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be weird if I get all interested when your father isn't?</font>

228
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:59,370
<font color="yellow">Mother, what if he couldn't show his emotions</font>

229
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,680
<font color="yellow">because of two of us?</font>

230
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,430
<font color="yellow">I am sorry that their relationship went south.</font>

231
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,900
<font color="yellow">But, I'm not sure if I'd like he'd come back.</font>

232
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,620
<font color="yellow">Don't you like how things are right now?</font>

233
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,830
<font color="yellow">Do you think we'll keep how things are right now when Joon Jae returns?</font>

234
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,770
<font color="yellow">- But I...<br>- Yes, you.</font>

235
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,910
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll keep what you have?</font>

236
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,300
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

237
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,130
<font color="yellow">I want to protect you.</font>

238
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,230
<font color="yellow">My good son! However...</font>

239
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,740
<font color="yellow">That's <i>my</i> job to protect us.</font>

240
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,540
<font color="yellow">Let's get in quickly.</font>

241
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,440
<font color="yellow">Yes. Bye.</font>

242
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,930
<font color="yellow">There's one footage of him from the surveillance camera from the nearby convenience store. It's back of him, though.</font>

243
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,080
<font color="yellow">He knows blind spots like nobody's business.</font>

244
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,660
<font color="yellow">That's why the police hasn't been able to catch him so far.</font>

245
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,070
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

246
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,050
<font color="yellow"><i>010-3654-23</i></font>

247
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,960
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

248
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,320
<font color="yellow"><i>Hi, do you happen to know Dept Head Nam Seong Joon? (using formal speech)</i></font>

249
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,400
<font color="yellow">Who is asking? <i>(using formal speech)</i></font>

250
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,230
<font color="yellow"><i>This is...(using formal speech)</i></font>

251
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,400
<font color="yellow">Is this Joon Jae? <i>(using informal speech)</i></font>

252
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,880
<font color="yellow"><i>You are. This is Chi Hyeon. (using informal speech)</i></font>

253
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,900
<font color="yellow">How did you get my number? <i>(using informal speech)</i></font>

254
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,690
<font color="yellow"><i>That's not what's important. Dept Head Nam is hurt greatly.</i></font>

255
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,360
<font color="yellow"><i>Your number is the last number that called him before the accident.</i></font>

256
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,170
<font color="yellow">Where is Cheong?</font>

257
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,440
<font color="yellow">- She went out.<br>- To where?</font>

258
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,940
<font color="yellow">I don't know, either.</font>

259
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,810
<font color="yellow">How could you just let her leave?</font>

260
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,930
<font color="yellow">When you don't know when and where that crazy bastard will pop up.</font>

261
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,950
<font color="yellow">He's the one who had Dept Head Nam's cell phone.</font>

262
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,430
<font color="yellow">Oh my, why do you direct your anger at me?</font>

263
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,570
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

264
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,640
<font color="yellow"><i>The phone is turned off. You'll get connected to the voicemail... </i></font>

265
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,730
<font color="yellow">She's not picking up again.</font>

266
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,570
<font color="yellow">Why does she go there so often?</font>

267
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,430
<font color="yellow">- So, the guy said he has plans to like you.<br>- Yes.</font>

268
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,060
<font color="yellow">Then today's the Day 1.</font>

269
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,440
<font color="yellow">Whoa. Good times.</font>

270
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,540
<font color="yellow">The one and only day in your love life.</font>

271
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,810
<font color="yellow">Of course, you'll have another one when you start dating another guy.</font>

272
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,990
<font color="yellow">Is it so?</font>

273
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,100
<font color="yellow">What you do from now on is very important if you want him to go head over heels for you.</font>

274
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,500
<font color="yellow">Tell me. How to make him go head over heels for me.</font>

275
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,370
<font color="yellow">So he won't ever get his head back up again.</font>

276
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,580
<font color="yellow">That's the way I can stay here ever after without hurting</font>

277
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,360
<font color="yellow">Are you Misery Chastain (from the movie Misery)?</font>

278
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,830
<font color="yellow">And do you think I'd be like this had I known how to do that?</font>

279
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,600
<font color="yellow">Look. There are three steps of love.</font>

280
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,600
<font color="yellow">The first step is romantic love, the second is hot love, the third is...</font>

281
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,050
<font color="yellow">"Dirty love."</font>

282
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,750
<font color="yellow">Dirty (love) belongs to the experts only.</font>

283
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,900
<font color="yellow">In my case, I'd go straight to the Dirty; but in your case, you should start with the Romantic.</font>

284
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,860
<font color="yellow">How do you do the Romantic?</font>

285
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,410
<font color="yellow">Honestly, that kind has all the bells and whistles for a show.</font>

286
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,560
<font color="yellow">Having a tea, having meals, going to the movies, taking you home,</font>

287
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,370
<font color="yellow">sending texts to check up on you, getting new sets of emojis,</font>

288
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,690
<font color="yellow">going to see the stars, planing an event for you, playing push and pull, and confessing his feelings for you...</font>

289
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,920
<font color="yellow">But all of this... is actually leading to dirty.</font>

290
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,070
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about that... dirty.</font>

291
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,210
<font color="yellow">Not yet for you.</font>

292
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,690
<font color="yellow">That, if you go recklessly then it could really be the end after seeing something nasty.</font>

293
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,290
<font color="yellow">You just shoot love guns.</font>

294
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,830

296
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,520
<font color="yellow">Look at that! Look at that; such young'uns.</font>

297
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,460
<font color="yellow">He's all over shooting hearts gun and all.</font>

298
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,510
<font color="yellow">Have you made nicknames for each other? Not your names but something only the two of you use.</font>

299

<font color="yellow">We don't.</font>

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,690
<font color="yellow">My first man called me "mong mong" (sound of dog barking).</font>

301
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,330
<font color="yellow">But it ended after a dog fight.</font>

302
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,810
<font color="yellow">Don't go towards animal names. The end isn't good.</font>

303
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,430
<font color="yellow">What would ours be?</font>

304
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,710
<font color="yellow">- Mermaid?<br>- What mermaid? You need something that's in this world.</font>

305
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,170
<font color="yellow">There's no mermaid in this world?</font>

306
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking like (Hans Christian) Andersen has come back to life? Then would there be one?</font>

307
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,790
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why aren't you answering your phone! What are you doing her-</font>

308
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,540
<font color="yellow">- Say hi, she's my friend.<br>- Oh, hello.</font>

309
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,110
<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

310
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,230
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go.</font>

311
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, you come here everyday and play with this beggar?</font>

312
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,790
<font color="yellow">I can hear it all, you know.</font>

313
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Let's go.</font>

314
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,290
<font color="yellow">I'm not a beggar!</font>

315
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,840
<font color="yellow">I'm homeless! Street people!</font>

316
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,300
<font color="yellow">I told you I'm not!</font>

317
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not a beggar! I don't accept freebies!</font>

318
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,560
<font color="yellow">Honey, Joon Jae is here.</font>

319
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,940
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae who you took care more than your son.</font>

320
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,800
<font color="yellow">You always said "Our Joon Jae, our Joon Jae."</font>

321
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,550
<font color="yellow">Wake up please.</font>

322
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,210
<font color="yellow">Ahjussi did not drink and drive.</font>

323
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,750
<font color="yellow">Have you checked the blackbox?</font>

324
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,700
<font color="yellow">There was no record from that day. It must have been broken.</font>

325
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,720
<font color="yellow"><i>Erasing records</i></font>

326
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,300
<font color="yellow">It looks like traumatic cataract.</font>

327
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,010
<font color="yellow">Seeing this here, there is a small wound.</font>

328
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,840
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, did you rub your eye hard or was it poked?</font>

329
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,960
<font color="yellow">No. None of that happened. These days my vision has been cloudy and darkened.</font>

330
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,760
<font color="yellow">I thought it was because of aging.

<font color="yellow">At any rate, I will prescribe anti-inflammatory and antibiotics.</font>

332
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,730
<font color="yellow">Take your medicines well. If this gets worse then complications could arise.</font>

333
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,190
<font color="yellow">Since there is no vein on cornea,</font>

334

<font color="yellow">Since you're here, eat dinner before you go.</font>

337
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,290
<font color="yellow">No, I have someone I have to visit. Next time.</font>

338
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,100
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae's family.</font>

339
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,160
<font color="yellow">At least, it's only Miss Sim Cheong who calls me Joon Jae's family.</font>

340
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,580
<font color="yellow">Did you come together with Joon Jae?</font>

341
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,110
<font color="yellow">I said it last time, but I'm not breaking up with Heo Joon Jae.</font>

342
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,390
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

343
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,450
<font color="yellow">But you two must be close. Are you going to get married?</font>

344
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,380
<font color="yellow">For now, we are still planning.</font>

345
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,090
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- A lot of things.</font>

346
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,200
<font color="yellow">But a family is looks like each other, warm and sweet.</font>

347
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,160
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you and Heo Joon Jae?</font>

348
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,130
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

349
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,110
<font color="yellow">Oh, Chi Hyeon, you're here.</font>

350
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

351
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,910
<font color="yellow">But, who?</font>

352
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,070
<font color="yellow">Father, that...</font>

353
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,860
<font color="yellow">Is this person Heo Joon Jae's family, too?</font>

354
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,680
<font color="yellow">Are you someone who knows my Joon Jae?</font>

355
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,300
<font color="yellow">- Ah, yes... the truth is...<br>- Yeah.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>You should rub my back properly for me to buy you. You can't do it sloppily like last time.</i></font>

358
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,370
<font color="yellow"><i>Buy me. Buy me.</i></font>

359
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,790
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay, you punk.</i></font>

360
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,190
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh yeah!</i></font>

361
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,060
<font color="yellow"><i>What about Joon Jae? Isn't he coming?</i></font>

362
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,050
<font color="yellow"><i>He must have slept early. Let's just go by ourselves.</i></font>

363
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,810
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's just get him food later when he says he's hungry.</i></font>

364
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad.</i></font>

365
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,780
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay.</i></font>

366
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Chi Hyeon, let's go. What do you want to eat?</i></font>

367
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,550
<font color="yellow"><i>- Steak.<br>- Okay, steak.</i></font>

368
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,430
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad, I'm sick.</i></font>

369
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,210
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?</font>

370
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,760
<font color="yellow">What have you been doing? Why did you get hurt?</font>

371
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,990
<font color="yellow">You're curious about me now?</font>

372
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,320
<font color="yellow">So who told you to leave home and suffer?</font>

373
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,100
<font color="yellow">You're doing good.</font>

374
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,000
<font color="yellow">I did not leave the house but I left your side.</font>

375
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,360
<font color="yellow">And I didn't suffer that much.</font>

376
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,550
<font color="yellow">If you compare it being in that house, it's much better.</font>

377
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,820
<font color="yellow">I feel like a burden has been lifted from me, too.</font>

378
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,380
<font color="yellow">What did I do? Taking care of Chi Hyeon a bit more than you?</font>

379
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,960
<font color="yellow">A son doesn't even know his father's heart?</font>

380
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,900
<font color="yellow">Did you really think I like Chi Hyeon more than you so I took care of him more?</font>

381
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,180
<font color="yellow">You are my son that's why I purposely--</font>

382
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,850
<font color="yellow">You gave up.</font>

383
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:06,000
<font color="yellow">On mom and me. And the time that we were together</font>

384
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,660
<font color="yellow">you threw it all away. Without looking back.</font>

385
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,250
<font color="yellow">Since you gave up and chose something else,</font>

386
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,900
<font color="yellow">don't hold on to what you let go and just forget it.</font>

387
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,160
<font color="yellow">You will know as you live.</font>

388
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,490
<font color="yellow">Life doesn't go the way you want it to.</font>

389
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,280
<font color="yellow">I'm now old</font>

390
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,290
<font color="yellow">and it's time to settle the inheritance.</font>

391
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,640
<font color="yellow">So, you should come back home.</font>

392
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

393
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,160
<font color="yellow">I will not receive anything.</font>

394
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,980
<font color="yellow">Be it money or the way life is lived.</font>

395
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,300
<font color="yellow">Or the way to throw people away, whatever it is.</font>

396
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,040
<font color="yellow">I don't wish to receive anything from you.</font>

397
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,660
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get involved with you. I don't want to meet you every again.</font>

398
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,480
<font color="yellow">This punk.</font>

399
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,750
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

400
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,830
<font color="yellow">please be healthy.</font>

401
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,880
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae.</font>

402
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,440
<font color="yellow">You can leave, too, if you want to.</font>

403
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,470
<font color="yellow">When I told you, "don't give up on what you have chosen,"</font>

404
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,530
<font color="yellow">it's all a non-sense.</font>

405
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,010
<font color="yellow">Where is such a thing?</font>

406
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:10,430
<font color="yellow">I also... was a whole lot comfortable and good when you weren't here.</font>

407
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,100
<font color="yellow">It hurts...</font>

408
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,510
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

409
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,360
<font color="yellow">I saw it on TV. Doing this got them better.</font>

410
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,190
<font color="yellow">Now you're not as hot.</font>

411
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,870
<font color="yellow">Who told you do this kind of thing?</font>

412
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,560
<font color="yellow">Go up.</font>

413
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,230
<font color="yellow">You say that, but you wish that I would stay next to you, right?</font>

414
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,410
<font color="yellow">No matter how much you tell me to give up, "no, I don't want to. I won't give up."</font>

415
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,320
<font color="yellow">Is what you wish I'd say, right?</font>

416
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Forget what you've given up. Don't have any lingering feelings.</i></font>

417
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,260
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to. I won't give up.</font>

418
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,190
<font color="yellow">No matter what you say, I'll stay by yourself without giving up,</font>

419
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,390
<font color="yellow">so don't get angry from not being able to say what you want and just say it.</font>

420
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,230
<font color="yellow">What it is that you really want to say.</font>

421
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,560
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

422
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,490
<font color="yellow">I couldn't.</font>

423
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,390
<font color="yellow">What I really wanted to say to my father.</font>

424
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,760
<font color="yellow">I couldn't say any of it.</font>

425
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,240
<font color="yellow">How difficult it was for me after leaving home.</font>

426
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,330
<font color="yellow">I hated my father so much,</font>

427
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,590
<font color="yellow">but because I thought he might look for me,</font>

428
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,900
<font color="yellow">I waited for a while without changing my phone number.</font>

429
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,400
<font color="yellow">But because in the end, he never called me once,</font>

430
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,020
<font color="yellow">how lonely I felt...</font>

431
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,370
<font color="yellow">I took the qualification exam on my own and went to college on my own,</font>

432
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,630
<font color="yellow">and while living on my own</font>

433
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,920
<font color="yellow">how much I missed him...</font>

434
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,170
<font color="yellow">That I...</font>

435
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,920
<font color="yellow">missed him so much...</font>

436
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,570
<font color="yellow">Are you a little better?</font>

437
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,330
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

438
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,460
<font color="yellow">- Earlier, that... <br> - Huh?</font>

439
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,550
<font color="yellow">- That. <br> - About you crying?</font>

440
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:36,860
<font color="yellow">Not so much crying but that there was a hint of tears.</font>

441
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:42,880
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I took some cold medicine before falling sleep so I wasn't in the right state of mind.</font>

442
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,410
<font color="yellow">I don't think there's any need to tell Nam Doo or Tae Oh about it.</font>

444
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:54,260
<font color="yellow">Okay. That's good then.</font>

445
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:00,360
<font color="yellow">From now on, you tell me as much as you want. What you can't tell the others.</font>

446
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,430
<font color="yellow">I'll listen to everything and forget it all. With everything in me.</font>

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,310
<font color="yellow">- Really, will you forget everything?<br>- Yeah.</font>

448
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,490
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

449
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,200

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

496
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,020
<font color="yellow">Let's go talk over there for a sec.</font>

497
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,160
<font color="yellow">Why? You can't say it here?</font>

498
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,580
<font color="yellow">I have something to explain while looking at the materials. Let's go.</font>

501
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,260
<font color="yellow">Oh, just a second.</font>

502
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,720
<font color="yellow">A few days ago, at the apartment redevelopment construction site in Dapsimni,</font>

503
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,010
<font color="yellow">a Joseon era site was discovered.</font>

504
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,280
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

505
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,670
<font color="yellow">This was the site of Kim Dam Ryeong's family home.</font>

506
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,670
<font color="yellow">While Professor Ha was telling us, I was so shocked that I came here to tell you first.</font>

507
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,850
<font color="yellow">As soon as we restore the relics from the shipwreck, we were going to open up an exhibition.</font>

508
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,720
<font color="yellow">If something more comes out of this excavation site,</font>

509
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,780
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be huge.</font>

510
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,870
<font color="yellow">You're saying this was Dam Ryeong's family home?</font>

511
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,320
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

512
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,620
<font color="yellow">- So?<br>- They say that</font>

521
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,150
<font color="yellow">What did they tell you at the hospital?</font>

522
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:17,940
<font color="yellow">That it's probably cataracts and that I should take my medicine.</font>

523
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,060
<font color="yellow">Hurry, take your medicine, and go to bed. You look really tired today.</font>

524
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,740
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

525
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,900
<font color="yellow">Aigoo.</font>

526
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,790
<font color="yellow">Honey, since Deputy Director Nam is in that state and all,</font>

527
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,580
<font color="yellow">shouldn't we hire a new person?</font>

528
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,280
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to look into it?</font>

529
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,600
<font color="yellow">Director Nam will probably be back on his feet soon...</font>

530
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,630
<font color="yellow">Let's just wait a bit.</font>

531
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,430
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure. Lie down.</font>

532
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,320
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

533
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,670
<font color="yellow">Omo, our Goo Bek <i>(900) came again.</i></font>

534
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,060
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, his nose seemed a little dry.</i></font>

535
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,550
<font color="yellow">Oh Bek <i>(500)</i> is here, too!</font>

536
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,250
<font color="yellow">- Oh, is his name Oh Bek (500)?<br>-Yes.</font>

537
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,980
<font color="yellow">- My dog's name is Goo Bek (900 in Korean). Because I spend 900 (man won) on him a month.<br>- Omo.</font>

538
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,340
<font color="yellow">I've already spent 8,500,000 won <i>($8500) on him this month.</i></font>

539
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,160
<font color="yellow">What do you do to spend 9,000,00 won on him? We do everything we need to.</font>

540
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,280
<font color="yellow">I even send him to Puppy Royal School. Isn't that right, Oh Bek?</font>

541
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, my child does some after-school activities.</font>

542
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,210
<font color="yellow">Ahh, after-school activities...</font>

543
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,680
<font color="yellow">What kind?</font>

544
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,570
<font color="yellow">On Monday, we teach him self-confidence. He just barks into the air.</font>

545
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,730
<font color="yellow">On Friday, he has learns about English manners.</font>

546
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,090
<font color="yellow">- I see, English manners? <br> - You know, we give orders a lot here.</font>

547
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,290
<font color="yellow">Sit. Lie down. Wait. Eat. We're very commanding.</font>

548
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,530
<font color="yellow">They say the English way is waiting.</font>

549
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,050
<font color="yellow">Oh I see.</font>

550
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,610
<font color="yellow">- I learned something today, thanks to you.<br>- It's nothing.</font>

551
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,120
<font color="yellow">- Goo Bek will now go in.<br>- Ah yes.</font>

552
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,240
<font color="yellow">I'll see you again.</font>

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,340
<font color="yellow">To the ladies of Seocho-dong Council, Daechi-dong, Apgujeong Department Store and Culture Center</font>

555
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,860
<font color="yellow">there is no better gossiper, than a Gangnam broker - which I've hired this time.</font>

556
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,370
<font color="yellow"><i>There is a social meeting called, Sawolhoe, that Ahn Jin Joo attends religiously for gossip. He also put in a few words.</i></font>

557
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,520
<font color="yellow">- Ladies, have you heard? <br> - What?</font>

558
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,480
<font color="yellow">This really remarkable guy, Kim Jae, just came back to Korea.</font>

559
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,790
<font color="yellow">While overseas, he started dabbling in international real estate, and turned himself into a wealthy man.</font>

560
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:50,720
<font color="yellow">This person owns a 57-floor building in Dubai, and runs a golf course. I hear he often closes doors</font>

561
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,640
<font color="yellow">to play golf with Mansour. He's on a whole new level.</font>

562
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,360
<font color="yellow">- For real?<br>- Are you talking about the Mansour we know?</font>

563
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,070
<font color="yellow">Last year, L-construction madam wanted to invest and</font>

564
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,820
<font color="yellow">brought her money bags and went all the way to Dubai, but returned after she was unable to even see him.</font>

565
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,810
<font color="yellow">- Really? Did Madam Choi really do that?<br>- Of course!</font>

566
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,520
<font color="yellow">Anyway, this guy was busy in Singapore.</font>

567
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,630
<font color="yellow">He was in the middle of a condominium building project,</font>

568
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:22,000
<font color="yellow">but came back to Korea in a hurry because...</font>

569
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,350
<font color="yellow">of his fiancé. She lives in Seoul, but he supposedly can't live without her.</font>

570
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,500
<font color="yellow">- Who's the fiancé?<br>- Is she a celebrity?</font>

571
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,780
<font color="yellow">I don't know that far because it's been hidden well. Anyway, because he's so into her</font>

572
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,320
<font color="yellow">that he's been buying out all the products in the Gangnam malls, everyday.</font>

573
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,480
<font color="yellow">Now that I've laid out the bait like this, what should we do now?</font>

574
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,270
<font color="yellow">All that's left is for Kim Jae and his fiancé to strut around the malls for a week.</font>

575
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,990
<font color="yellow">Who'll play the fiancé?</font>

576
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,230
<font color="yellow">Hey, Tae Oh!</font>

577
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,330
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding? You're telling me to take him?</font>

578
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,300
<font color="yellow">He's pretty, but this is stretching it too far, right?</font>

579
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,320
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

580
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,030
<font color="yellow">- What about Cheong?<br>- Stop saying nonsense.</font>

581
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,830
<font color="yellow">You've been super careful nowadays and taking Cheong everywhere you go.</font>

582
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,910
<font color="yellow">- So when you're working, are you going to leave her by herself?<br>- Ah, how can I take her there?</font>

583
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,050
<font color="yellow">- Where am I going?<br>- Gosh, you scared me.</font>

584
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,230
<font color="yellow">Hey Cheong! Our Cheong.</font>

585
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,790
<font color="yellow">Would you listen to me for a moment?</font>

586
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,790
<font color="yellow">You like dramas, right?</font>

587
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,770
<font color="yellow">The truth is, the people in the TV aren't small people...</font>

588
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,100
<font color="yellow">I know. They're in a studio. It's a drama.</font>

589
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,690
<font color="yellow">So you know?</font>

590
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,330
<font color="yellow">- Our Cheong is surprisingly smart.</font>

591
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,270
<font color="yellow">Our Cheong? Our?</font>

592
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,970
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying she's smart.</font>

593
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:49,520
<font color="yellow">So, we're going to be filming something like a drama.</font>

594
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,790
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae's role in this drama is a rich, cool man.</font>

595
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,160
<font color="yellow">General manager? Director?</font>

596
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,210
<font color="yellow">- All the cool guys in dramas play those kinds of roles<br>- Exactly like that!</font>

597
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:05,710
<font color="yellow">And our Cheong's role is his fiancé. They're going to get married!</font>

598
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,320
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

599
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,630
<font color="yellow">Right, you like it, right? See? She likes it, huh?</font>

600
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,640
<font color="yellow">Cheong, when you're there, there are just three things that you must not do.</font>

601
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,460
<font color="yellow">Don't talk.</font>

602
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,280
<font color="yellow">Don't laugh.</font>

603
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,010
<font color="yellow">Don't eat.</font>

604
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,340
<font color="yellow">- That's going to be a bit difficult.<br>- I'll buy you something more delicious afterwards.</font>

605
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,880
<font color="yellow">Specifically what?</font>

606
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,080
<font color="yellow">You like sweet things. Ice cream? Cake?</font>

607
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,020
<font color="yellow">- That plus...<br>-Plus?<br>-Plus?</font>

608
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,080
<font color="yellow">Sweet and sour pork.</font>

609
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,980
<font color="yellow">Deal.</font>

610
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,140
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

611
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,020
<font color="yellow">Our Cheong is a real Seoulite now.</font>

612
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,960
<font color="yellow">Let's go! To use money!</font>

613
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,600
<font color="yellow">This, this, and this.</font>

614
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,940
<font color="yellow">What else, honey?</font>

615
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,070
<font color="yellow">The 'La (Piazetta) Di Capri' one, too.</font>

616
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,030
<font color="yellow">- Oh just buy it all.<br>- Give us all of it.</font>

617
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,040
<font color="yellow">The end?</font>

618
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,150
<font color="yellow">Just give the whole thing with hangers.</font>

619
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,380
<font color="yellow">Okay this one. Okay this one, too!</font>

620
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,730
<font color="yellow">Please wrap all the jewels.</font>

621
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,870
<font color="yellow">Why can't I use the VVIP room, right now? You said you thought I could, earlier.</font>

622
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,140
<font color="yellow">I apologize. We have a guest who made a reservation just a while ago.</font>

623
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,380
<font color="yellow">I am also a guest who made a reservation just a while ago. Have I been pushed back? Why?</font>

624
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,390
<font color="yellow">I'm a White Magnolia Club member!</font>

625
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,650
<font color="yellow">I've seen this woman before.</font>

626
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,960
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

627
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,990
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?<br>- Omo! You're here.</font>

628
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:14,950
<font color="yellow">Our Honey, doesn't ever wear the same pair of shoes twice. We end up having to come back frequently.</font>

629
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:19,080
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's not like I can carry you around everywhere. Honey, do your feet hurt?</font>

630
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:26,020
<font color="yellow">Seoul is so uncomfortable.The buildings are too close by that we can ride on our private jet, unlike Dubai.</font>

631
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,180
<font color="yellow">Dubai? Dubai?</font>

632
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,520
<font color="yellow">Dubai?!</font>

633
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,610
<font color="yellow">Would you check it all? Hurry up. Hurry up!</font>

634
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,890
<font color="yellow">Goo Bek's dad?</font>

635
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,990
<font color="yellow">Goo Bek's dad!</font>

636
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,110
<font color="yellow">Goo Bek's dad?</font>

637
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,690
<font color="yellow">Oh, isn't it Oh Bek's mother?</font>

638
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,610
<font color="yellow">- Oh yes. It's good to see you!<br>- It's good to see you, too!</font>

639
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,560
<font color="yellow">The people who just came...</font>

640
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,980
<font color="yellow">Did you come with them?</font>

641
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:00,760
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. I run an investment company, and some VIP guests came from abroad.</font>

642
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,720
<font color="yellow">Ahh. The man who just went inside?</font>

643
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, well then.</font>

644
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,420
<font color="yellow">Oh wait! Did that person, perhaps,</font>

645
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,460
<font color="yellow">Did he come from Dubai?</font>

646
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,100
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

647
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,660
<font color="yellow">Well, in Dubai, he has a 57-story building</font>

648
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:25,300
<font color="yellow">and a like-a golfing course and like being friends with Mansour</font>

649
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,050
<font color="yellow">and like like, what was his name again?</font>

650
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,440
<font color="yellow">Kim Jae, and that fiancé he's so in love with.</font>

651
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,650
<font color="yellow">Wait, where did you hear those things from?</font>

652
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,710
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

653
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:40,200
<font color="yellow">If you tell anyone else, things will get messy around here so I'm telling you, you can't tell anyone--ever.</font>

654
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,240
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes, yes. Yes.</font>

655
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,580
<font color="yellow">Darling, how do you like it?</font>

656
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:57,530
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

657
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,810
<font color="yellow">Mhm, I see. Great comment, as expected from you.</font>

658
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,740
<font color="yellow">I want to eat spicy rice cakes.</font>

659
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:10,610
<font color="yellow">You are always __________. And I like that about you.</font>

660
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,040
<font color="yellow">And soondae. <i>(blood sausage)</i></font>

661
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:18,220
<font color="yellow">Your standards are unmatched as always, alright, let's buy that too then.</font>

662
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,570
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Take this.</font>

663
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,850
<font color="yellow">Alright, no problem.</font>

664
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,890
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait a minute.</font>

665
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:32,500
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. Can I ask you a favor?</font>

666
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, what is it?</font>

667
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:42,570
<font color="yellow">The thing is, do you think you could arrange a meal with us and them?</font>

668
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,380
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm actually in the position of tending to them as well so for me to make requests and such is a bit--</font>

669
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,130
<font color="yellow">We're actually very interested in investments too!</font>

670
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,840
<font color="yellow">I just want to maybe try to put in a word or two. What do you think? Impossible?</font>

671
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,160
<font color="yellow">The truth is, our CEO Kim has been away from Korea for so long</font>

672
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,960
<font color="yellow">he did mention that he wanted to eat home cooked Korean food.</font>

673
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,900
<font color="yellow">But I'm still not married so--</font>

674
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:13,130
<font color="yellow">Home cooked food! Then our house is a must, the food at our place is killer!</font>

675
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,430
<font color="yellow">At our house...we have the female Baek Jong Won. <i>(famous restaurant entrepreneur in Korea)</i></font>

676
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,410
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

677
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,350
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

678
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,670
<font color="yellow">He said he'll mention it to them.</font>

679
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,840
<font color="yellow">Honey, if we can get this done, then we've hit the jackpot!</font>

680
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,080
<font color="yellow">It's awesome. Totally awesome.</font>

681
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,690
<font color="yellow">I mean, just as when things were stared to work out, it gets completely solved! Just like that! Don't you think?</font>

682
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,170
<font color="yellow">Ahjumma! Please take good care of us!</font>

683
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,560
<font color="yellow">I'll just be doing as I always do.</font>

684
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,060
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

685
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,400
<font color="yellow">Don't be surprised.</font>

686
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,430
<font color="yellow">They said he's so close to Mansour, they play golf together.</font>

687
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,830
<font color="yellow">Totally awesome.</font>

688
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,230
<font color="yellow">You don't think he's a con artist?</font>

689
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,800
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

690
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,170
<font color="yellow">I mean, I get the feeling he's a con artist just by listening to you.</font>

691
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,610
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

692
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,370
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I even called Madam Choi of L-construction, and</font>

693
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,170
<font color="yellow">I even confirmed that she went to Dubai last year only to get rejected!</font>

694
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,100
<font color="yellow">Right. Then it's for sure.</font>

695
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,770
<font color="yellow">You're not going to help us, at the very least, don't ruin it for us.</font>

696
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:11,090
<font color="yellow">Even if we got him millions of dollars right now, he wouldn't spare a glance!</font>

697
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:11,930
<font color="yellow">Of course he won't.</font>

698
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,990
<font color="yellow">And that's what you'd expect from a typical Ponzi scheme.</font>

699
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,700
<font color="yellow">He pulls in investors as if he could afford everything</font>

700
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,160
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't let just anyone in, which makes you all the more ambitious to get in, or something like that.</font>

701
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,010
<font color="yellow">Then, when we invite him over to eat,</font>

702
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,640
<font color="yellow">Auntie, you can stay and see him with us, that's what we can do.</font>

703
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,210
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you can eat with us.</font>

704
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,450
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

705
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:42,050
<font color="yellow">Hello? Yeah, hold on.</font>

706
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,030
<font color="yellow">Really? Where is it right now?</font>

707
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,610
<font color="yellow">Wow, our Cheong did really well today.</font>

708
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,050
<font color="yellow">I did well?</font>

709
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,950
<font color="yellow">Yeah! What--You were just like a secret agent! Right, Joon Jae?</font>

710
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,100
<font color="yellow">Well, she was whatever--I told you before, this kid's smart.</font>

711
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,330
<font color="yellow">When you teach her one thing, she catches on real fast!</font>

712
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,480
<font color="yellow">What is this, PTA? Are you bragging about your kid right now?</font>

713
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,000
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

714
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,100
<font color="yellow">I had fun today too. Because I could help Heo Joon Jae with his good deeds.</font>

715
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,170
<font color="yellow">But Heo Joon Jae, did you know? The man in charge of that doll picking machine, he's a con artist.</font>

716
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,040
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

717
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,880
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

718
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,770
<font color="yellow">I kept trying to pull one but I couldn't get any so I asked around</font>

719
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:30,030
<font color="yellow">and people told me he's a con artist. Sick bastard.</font>

720
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,780
<font color="yellow">Con artist. Right. Con artists are definitely sick bastards, right?</font>

721
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,110
<font color="yellow">But! Con artists aren't always bad people.</font>

722
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,610
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, there are just sick bastards who con even sicker bastards.</font>

723
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,270
<font color="yellow">Still, they're lying to people.</font>

724
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:52,080
<font color="yellow">Cheong, you've never done that? Not once lied to people?</font>

725
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,950

<font color="yellow">I feel like you do.</font>

727
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,880
<font color="yellow">Just stop! Why're you cornering her like that!</font>

728
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,450
<font color="yellow">What the--Is this really a PTA meeting?</font>

729
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,040
<font color="yellow">Tae Oh, isn't this weird!? He's just completely sticking up for her!</font>

730
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,040
<font color="yellow">Between the two of you, is there a change in your relationship or something?</font>

731
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,120
<font color="yellow">- No.<br>- Yes.</font>

732
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,160
<font color="yellow">What?! What's the answer?! You said yes and no!? What's the right answer!?</font>

733
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,130
<font color="yellow">Just be quiet! Don't chat in my car.</font>

734
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,240
<font color="yellow">If you're going to chat then get off!</font>

735
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,230
<font color="yellow">Oh, Si Ah. Really?</font>

736
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,560
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

737
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,730
<font color="yellow">Let me out. I have to go somewhere.</font>

738
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,720
<font color="yellow">You are really going to get out? Where are you going?</font>

739
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,640
<font color="yellow">Si Ah said she has something to show me.</font>

740
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,800
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen it yet, either. But the underclassman that excavated it</font>

741
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,670
<font color="yellow">says this one's really special.</font>

742
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,320
<font color="yellow">Typically, porcelains or paintings and calligraphic works excavated from a house</font>

00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,340
<font color="yellow">cannot be preserved in a good condition.</font>

744
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:04,200
<font color="yellow">But this one, it was buried in a completely sealed box.</font>

745
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,640
<font color="yellow">Buried?</font>

746
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,770
<font color="yellow">Yeah. As if, someone was asking for it to be found in the future.</font>

747
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,900
<font color="yellow">- Wait a minute.<br>- Hm?</font>

748
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,600
<font color="yellow">Can I look by myself for a minute?</font>

749
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,730
<font color="yellow">Ah, well, sure.</font>
