<i>[EPISODE 12]</i>

3
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,100
Welcome.

4
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Thank you. Let's have
ourselves a marvelous fight.

5
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Well, I don't know.
It won't be over until one of us is dead.

6
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,100
Let's see what ends up
happening when the time comes.

7
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,100
All right. Welcome!

8
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you!

9
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,100
I'll do my very best!

10
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,700
Please help me to be
the best that I can be!

11
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,730
You people were going to
end up doing this anyway

12
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,600
so why did you end up resorting to
using your wife's secret home?

13
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,200
You people aren't going to win anyway,
so why did you crawl in here?

14
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,000
How about coming up with an original
retort instead of copying mine?

15
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Remember that.

16
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,500
What a load of bull.

17
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,700
Ah, Mr. Joo.
Long time no see.

18
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,900
No, that's not right. You became
a colonel thanks to Assemblyman Park.

19
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,000
No. It's all thanks to him that I ended
up leaving the military altogether.

20
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,700
What a complete asshole.

21
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,200
Is that the place...

22
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,600
where my mother is?

23
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,800
Wow, how is it that she
looks exactly like her mother?

24
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Even her proportions
and her stride are the same!

25
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah. I'd believe it if you
told me that she was Ume Hye Rin.

26
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,400
But that's kind of a shoddy grave for
someone who was Korea's top actress.

27
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

28
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,700
I mean, wasn't Madam Choi Yoo Jin
from JB Group her friend?

29
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
So why did she allow her to
be buried here like this?

30
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,800
That's a good point.

31
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Anna. You should say
hello to your mother.

32
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Give her the flowers first.

33
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,700
Mom.

34
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry that it took me
this long to get here.

35
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,300
I wanted to come by sooner...

36
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,100
but I couldn't.

37
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,900
Mom.

38
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Dad won't come.
So don't wait for him.

39
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
So...

40
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,100
rest in peace without
any pills this time.

41
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,600
What's going on?

42
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,200
Anna.

43
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,600
Your mother probably met
your father in heaven already.

44
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Mom. Mom! Mom!

45
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, Ms. Ji Yeon?

46
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,200
This seems to be
the juiciest bit

47
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,400
among all the other information
I've received about Ume Hye Rin.

48
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,030
Really?

49
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,100
Wait, seriously?
So where is that?

50
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,600
Thank you.

51
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,800
So you acted as if you beat
the crap out of Park Kwan Soo

52
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
but all you actually did was
hide in his hidden room?

53
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Yes.

54
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,900
Wow, I didn't even know that, and...

55
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,300
Wait.

56
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,000
So everyone else except
me knew about all this?

57
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Well, probably because
the mission's details were classified.

58
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,900
Yeah, figures.

59
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,600
Why would you tell an old fogey like me
about important things like that?

60
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't say things like that.

61
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,300
There's something I'm curious
about, though, Master Song.

62
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,600
What? Huh?

63
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,800
Geez.

64
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,800
About Chairman Choi Sung Won.
How did he come to inherit JB Group?

65
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,300
I'm sure that Choi Yoo Jin
was a formidable foe for him.

66
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,600
She was quite strong-willed.

67
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,800
A lot of the subsidiaries' CEOs were
pushing for Yoo Jin more, actually.

68
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,100
Yoo Jin... no, I mean, Madam Choi,
was quite clever since she was young.

69
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,800
She excelled in school too.

70
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,900
But her eye for men is terrible.

71
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
And that was to be
expected, really

72
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,400
since they only drilled her in
management since she was younger.

73
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,300
But then, a huge player like Jang
Se Joon came along and seduced her.

74
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,900
So it's only natural that she fell
head over heels for him.

75
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Wait, so the previous
chairman got angry at her

76
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
for marrying him despite
the chairman's opposition and...

77
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Yeah, more or less.

78
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,600
Also, JB Group was going through
a bit of a rough patch then

79
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
because they didn't restructure well
after the Asian financial crisis.

80
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
And because the chairman
was so opposed to Se Joon

81
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,600
he found tons of rich bachelors for her
to marry instead, to get through to her.

82
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,800
But alas, she wasn't
interested in any of them.

83
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,600
But Choi Sung Won was quick to marry
whoever his father chose for him.

84
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,300
And that's what led to all this.

85
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,200
The fact that Chairman Choi is chairman
now is largely thanks to his in-laws.

86
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,600
That's why he treats his father-in-law
so well even now too.

87
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,400
So Chairman Choi is a bit less
aggressive than his older sister then?

88
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
What?

89
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,300
Oh, geez. People don't
know anything, do they?

90
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,200
Sung Won is actually far more
aggressive than his sister.

91
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,900
Nobody can guess
what that man may be thinking.

92
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,800
But how is it that
you know all of this?

93
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,100
You didn't know that I'm the oldest
JSS veteran around, right?

94
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,900
I used to be a bodyguard for JB Group.

95
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,600
And this company basically started as
JB Group's exclusive bodyguards.

96
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
So it's only natural that
I'd know everything about that family.

97
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,300
Visiting hours are over now.

98
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,600
Don't worry too much.
Your uncle is here.

99
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
Don't be nervous, okay?

100
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,100
All right.

101
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,500
You got a smoke?

102
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,700
Hey, now!

103
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,800
Just let him off the hook this once.

104
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
It is a special occasion, after all.

105
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,100
All right then. Say what you need
to say first and quickly.

106
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,300
Wow, way to be petty.

107
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,500
That's what money is
good for, after all!

108
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,600
You don't remember me, Miss?

109
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
We met on that night.

110
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,000
In your mom's room.

111
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,900
Oh, do you not remember because
I shined a light on your face?

112
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Mom?

113
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,200
Do you remember now?

114
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,900
Burglary is my specialty.

115
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,400
<i>And I broke into your house that night
since you people seemed to be well off.</i>

116
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,600
<i>I never would've imagined that it was the
house of Ume Hye Rin, the movie star.</i>

117
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,400
I got to work because I
thought everyone was asleep

118
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,600
<i>but I felt someone creep into the room
without making any noise at all.</i>

119
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
<i>So I went and hid.</i>

120
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>I figured that it was just
another burglar like me.</i>

121
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,200
But that wasn't the case at all.

122
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,700
They crept into
the room I was in, silently.

123
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,600
And then, Ume Hye Rin,
who'd been there...

124
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm not sure if it's okay for me to
tell her daughter this sort of thing.

125
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,600
She'll be quite traumatized.

126
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,000
It's fine. Continue.

127
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,300
Sure. Prepare yourself, though.

128
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,300
<i>That person straddled Ume Hye Rin
and put a needle in her neck.</i>

129
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,500
I was right.
I remembered correctly.

130
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,600
I knew right there and then that I
witnessed something I shouldn't have.

131
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,100
Did you see the face of the person
who put the needle in her neck?

132
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
Yes, I did.

133
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
Do you remember
what they looked like?

134
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,800
Well...

135
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,700
probably.

136
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,600
It's about time for you to
do me a favor now, isn't it?

137
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,500
- Attorney Lee.
- Yes?

138
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,800
What can we do for this man?

139
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,800
He had three charges against him.
We can't do anything about the first one

140
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,600
but the second charge
is breaking and entering.

141
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,100
And the third charge is something that
can be settled with the victim's family.

142
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,600
If he does that, he'll be able to avoid
receiving any additional punishment

143
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,500
and can reduce his sentence
by up to four years.

144
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,600
All right, then. Do you remember the face
of the person who put the needle in her?

145
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,500
Of course I do!

146
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,400
Do you need any photos
for reference?

147
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,700
No.

148
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
The woman who was by
Young Miss's side.

149
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,700
When you were on TV, Young Miss.

150
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,600
The woman who was
by your side then.

151
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,000
It was that woman.

152
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,100
Can you testify about this in court?

153
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,290
Getting my sentence reduced
is nice and all

154
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,600
but I need to consider
the people who'll be after me regardless.

155
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Sure. Of course.

156
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,900
Sure, then.

157
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,300
Hey. Anna won't pick up her phone.

158
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,600
<i>She's probably busy
at the beauty salon.</i>

159
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Wait, where are you now?

160
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
<i>I'm doing security checks
at the fashion show location now.</i>

161
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What? Who's guarding Anna now then?

162
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,600
<i>Don't worry. Anna is at the salon now.
I talked to her not too long ago.</i>

163
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,500
<i>Anna said that she'll come with K2.
So you bring her, okay?</i>

164
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
All right, then.

165
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,700
Why? Why can't we report
Choi Yoo Jin for this now?

166
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,100
If we do that now, your father will
have to give up the presidential race.

167
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
Are you okay with that?

168
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,100
I don't care.

169
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
Anna.

170
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
It's only fair that my Big Sis who
committed a crime is punished.

171
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,300
And you'll only be free
if your father becomes president.

172
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,600
So we have to make sure your dad
isn't tangled up in this incident at all.

173
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,700
Big Sis was the assailant
and your father is a victim.

174
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,200
We have to make that clear to the public
before we reveal her crime to the world.

175
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you get what I'm saying?

176
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
So this all could end up being
a blessing in disguise

177
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,000
and may cause lots of people
to pity your dad.

178
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,700
So let's change people's opinions first.

179
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,900
This probably won't
take too long, either.

180
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,000
A few days is all it'll take.

181
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,100
How will we do that?

182
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,000
I have a way.
Just trust me.

183
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh yeah. You definitely can't
tell Je Ha about this, okay?

184
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Why not?

185
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,300
If she finds out about this,
all our plans will be foiled.

186
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,100
What? Je Ha definitely
won't tell Choi Yoo Jin, though.

187
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,300
Oh, my dear, innocent Anna.

188
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,500
He loves you, but he can't help
but be on Choi Yoo Jin's side.

189
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,100
Let's head to the salon
before Je Ha gets there.

190
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,700
An angel has to capture
the hearts of the people tonight.

191
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay?

192
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,500
- Oh, you're here?
- Yeah.

193
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Why did you send J4 ahead?

194
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,600
Huh?

195
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, because I'd be
keeping her here too long...

196
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,900
But still!

197
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,000
Well, okay. But don't do that again.

198
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Okay.

199
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
- Let's go.
- Um, excuse me.

200
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,900
I guess you two don't have
a normal VIP-and-bodyguard relationship.

201
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
- No...
- Yes.

202
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,300
He's my boyfriend.

203
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,200
Oh, I see!
Please take a seat, Mr. Boyfriend!

204
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,100
- No.
- I'll make you two both look great!

205
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,800
- Oh, thank you!
- Come now!

206
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
- Please sit!
- It's fine!

207
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,100
You'll be an embarrassment if you look
this uncool at a high-fashion event!

208
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,600
Isn't that right?

209
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,700
What? I look uncool?

210
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,200
- No!
- Just sit! I'll make you look great!

211
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
- Sit. She'll make you look good.
- Wait, do I look uncool?

212
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,900
- No, not at all!
- Sit! Sit!

213
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,900
All right, then.

214
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
Welcome.

215
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Are you all right?

216
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Did you take the medication I gave you?

217
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,100
Yes, I did.

218
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,500
Good.

219
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,100
Let me know if you need more.
I have more with me.

220
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,900
I will.

221
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,400
Oh yeah. Let's do well today, okay?

Hello.

224
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,400
Oh, Ms. Anna!

225
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,600
Oh my god!

226
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
To think that I'm in charge of
the Ume Hye Rin tribute fashion show!

227
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,800
It's such an honor to have you walk
for me before Jean-Paul Lafelt!

228
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
No, I'm the one who's honored.

229
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,400
I hope that your show isn't
ruined because of me.

230
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
No, no.

231
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm not sure if I'll be able to
walk down the catwalk well.

232
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,600
Ms. Anna, it's just walking.
So just walk. That's all there is to it.

233
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,300
Yes. And my clothes
will be your wings! Ta-da!

234
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,200
Please take good care of my Anna.

235
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,300
Don't worry, Chairman!

236
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,000
All right, let's start the rehearsal!

237
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,600
Just a moment.

238
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,800
Uncle.

239
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,200
Please give me some more medicine.

240
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
Why? Are you not feeling well?

241
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,500
No, I just feel really
uneasy and nervous.

242
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,800
Then you should take more.

243
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,100
Again?

244
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,400
It's fine. He said that they're safe.

245
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,900
Here.

246
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,100
What are you doing?

247
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
Just give them to me.

248
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,600
Come with me.

249
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,800
Anna. If you take these again,
that will be three times today.

250
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,000
I looked into these, and they're not
good for you if you take too many.

251
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
And you'll grow dependent on them.

252
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,800
Just let me do this, just for today.

253
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Look. Everyone is gathered
here today for Mom.

254
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,400
There's this many people
who remember Mom.

255
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
But still!

256
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,700
This is a tribute to her.
I really want to do well.

257
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,400
So help me do that. Okay?

258
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,500
I feel like I have to in order
to have no more regrets.

259

Okay?

262
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,500
Give that to me.

263
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,100
Ms. Anna!
What's taking you so long?

264
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,600
We only have 20 minutes
left until showtime!

265

What are you doing?

269
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
What do you mean?

270
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,700
Are you seriously going to act as if
you don't know what I'm talking about?

271
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,600
Why are you going so far as to pump her
with drugs to put her in the public eye?

272
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,700
We have to pay tribute to her.

273
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,600
A star garners love easily,
but they're also easily forgotten.

274
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,900
We have to make the public
remember Ume Hye Rin again

275
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,500
since they've forgotten about her.

276
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,800
And we have to make them
curious about her death.

277
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,100
That's what Anna and I want.

278
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,900
Anna wants me to give this to you.

279
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,900
She said that it seemed like you
didn't even have any water today.

280
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,400
<i>Je Ha, don't worry. I'll do
an awesome stride down the catwalk.</i>

281
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Yes. Yes, I understand.

282
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,300
Please come out, Ms. Go Anna!

283
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
She's coming out now.

284
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,800
Are you ready?

285
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
Wait! Wait.

286
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,800
The bracelet.
It's the finishing touch.

287
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Here.

288
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,900
There we go.

289
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,600
This is a style that Ms. Hye Rin
used to like back in the day.

290
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
I prepared this especially
to give to you today.

291
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I think it'll look great on you.
All right, let's see here now.

292
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,400
Hair, earrings, bracelet, dress!

293
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
And to top it off, your face!
It's all perfect!

294
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,400
We're good here!
All right, let's go!

295
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,600
Let's go.

296
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,900

Ume Hye Rin's daughter.

298
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,500
I felt like you were more used to seeing
her like this, so I came out like this.

299
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:30,500

and participating in this fashion show.

like this, even now, in my mother's name.

301
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,500

is with us here today too.

302
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,000
Thank you.

307
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,950

- Yeah.

hurry and get changed.

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,350
And Jang Se Joon gets to wiggle
his way out of all this, huh?

343
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,850
How about we cancel the volunteer
work scheduled for today?

344
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,450
No, there's no need for that.

345
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,150
I'll seem even more
pathetic if I do that.

346
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,750
Uncle. Did you really
make this post go viral?

347
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,050
Yes.

348
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,350
But how could you make up
something so ridiculous and untrue?

349
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,750
You can't make my mom out
to be such a terrible person!

350
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,650
Of course it has to be ridiculous.

351
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,850
If this were true,
it'd be big trouble.

352
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,850
What?

353
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,450
We have to sully your mother's name
with this kind of outlandishness

354
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,000
for it to be reported.

355
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,250
But you're the one
who put this online.

356
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,050
They should be reporting
Choi Yoo Jin, not you.

357
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,550
Oh, my innocent little angel.

358
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,850
I have to do this for Big Sis to
get investigated by the police

359
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,950
and that'll lead to her getting
questioned for being involved in murder.

360
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,050
And we'll pull out our hidden card then.

361
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,750
Do you get it now?

362
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,450
You're confused, right?

363
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,050
It's okay. Your uncle will
take care of all this.

364
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,750
Also, I'd never frame your mother
for this kind of ridiculous crime!

365
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,150
Everything will be revealed
once the investigation begins.

366
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,450
And Choi Yoo Jin will be
brought to justice for sure too.

367
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,250
You didn't tell Je Ha, right?

368
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,250
No, I didn't.

369
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,550
All right, good.

370
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,650
We have to drop by the police station,
so get ready and come down.

371
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:12,150
The rumor is quite shocking,
so it's spreading like wildfire.

372
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:18,950
Ms. Anna is Madam Choi's daughter
whom she had through an affair?

373
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:29,550
But Ms. Anna was born way before Madam
Choi and Assemblyman Jang got married.

374
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,150
How can someone have an affair
if they're not even married?

375
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,150
Can you really call
this an affair, then?

376
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,150
Well, yes, that's true.

377
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,250
An affair, by definition, is something
you have after getting married.

378
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,250
It'll only sully Madam Choi
and Assemblyman Jang's names

379
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:49,750
to continue talking
about this nonsense.

380
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,450
So I'll stop talking about it.

381
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,850
But!

382
00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:00,750
But regarding the issue that Ms. Anna
really is related to Madam Choi...

383
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,650
We're living in
the 21st century now, folks.

384
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,050
A simple DNA test will
resolve all this, won't it?

385
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,650
That's right, yes.

386
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:13,150
And regarding the rumor that Ms.
Ume Hye Rin blackmailed Madam Choi

387
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,150
and Madam Choi
killed her as a result...

388
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,650
that's just ridiculous.

389
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:26,750
<i>And all this happened due to the mystery
surrounding Ume Hye Rin's death, right?</i>

390
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,150
<i>But Assemblyman, wasn't that
already ruled a suicide?</i>

391
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,950
After hearing what Ms. Anna
said on TV the other day

392
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,150
I understood how she felt.

393
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,850
<i>Wouldn't anyone have suspicions
about their mother's death</i>

394
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,450
<i>with the circumstances surrounding
it being so mysterious?</i>

395
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:54,850
<i>So Madam Choi should go
to the police and confess everything</i>

396
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,150
and the police should look into
the mystery behind Ms. Ume's death.

397
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,450
I believe that such an investigation
should be carried out, yes.

398
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,050
So, a re-investigation?

399
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,450
Doesn't that require
the victim to petition for it

400
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,950
or for some new decisive
evidence to come out?

401
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:18,150
Exactly. But I'm just voicing
my own personal opinion.

402
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,250
<i>But if they don't want to, that's fine.</i>

403
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,850
Is that man really on our side?

404
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,550
Not anymore, it seems.

405
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,650
Oh, they're coming in!

406
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,350
Please say something, Chairman Choi!

407
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,050
I've never seen such
a vile post in my entire life.

408
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,250
We'll definitely be
suing for defamation

409
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,450
and we'll definitely find the one
trying to sully our family's name

410
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,950
and bring them to court!

411
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,750
Hey, isn't your uncle
an amazing actor?

412
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,650
Oh hello, Chairman.

413
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,450
Welcome, sir.

414
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,750
Hello, Police Chief.

415
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,550
Let us be on our way, then.

416
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,840
We heard all about it.
You must be quite upset.

417
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,340
No, I'm okay. We just have to
catch them and throw them in jail.

418
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,550
Here's the bill of indictment.

419
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,650
Oh, you didn't need to
bring this yourself!

420
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,150
I was thinking of sending
it directly to my attorney

421
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,840
but I figured I'd get some photos
of me taken by the press

422
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,740
and wanted to talk to you
in person, so I came here.

423
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,240
What?

424
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,950
Please take good care
of this investigation.

425
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,340
Of course!

426
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,840
People who are spreading
rumors like this...

427
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,950
There's that, but I'm talking about
Anna's mother's incident in particular.

428
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,950
What?

429
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,650
This may all start
as a defamation case

430
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,550
but once you get to investigating
the witnesses for the case...

431
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,840
you may find that this may be connected
to other cases too, don't you think?

432
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,950
By witnesses, do you mean...

Let me help you, ma'am!
Please get some rest!

435
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
You don't need to
help us this much.

436
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,140
Thank you so much.

437
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,240
No, no. You're always doing
such good deeds, Father.

438
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,740
I'm more thankful.

439
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
- Shall I put the chairs out too?
- Yes, please.

440
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,550
What? Is that true?

441
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,640
Yes. I'm sure that Chairman
Choi's target is Choi Yoo Jin.

442
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,050
And it seems that he has witnesses
prepared already too.

443
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:06,850
Wow, these rich people sure play
dirty when it comes to money!

444
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,550
What should I do, sir?

445
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,240
Hey, do you even need to ask?

446
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,640
Of course you should
start an investigation!

447
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,240
Dead people don't deserve to have their
reputations sullied because they're dead!

448
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,640
We need to help her
let go of her grudge!

449
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,950
All right, then.

450
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,240
Her... grudge?
What do you mean by that, sir?

451
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,740
Looks like all of this will come tumbling
down without me having to do anything!

452
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,740
Wow.

453
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,050
Call the prosecutor's office
for me, will you?

454
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,640
Yes, sir.

455
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,640
I have a really good
feeling about this.

456
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,550
Yep, yep.

457
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,550
Sir!

458
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,550
What will happen with
the accusations regarding Ms. Go Anna?

459
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,350
What do you mean "what'll happen"?

460
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,850
It's only natural that the police
investigate any accusation that comes in.

461
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:00,350
We have to investigate the people who
are spreading baseless rumors online.

462
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,350
No, not that!

463
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,450
I'm talking about
the parties involved in all that.

464
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,550
You know, like Choi Yoo Jin
and Jang Se Joon.

465
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,050
We'll only know after the police
do the initial investigation.

466
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,740
I'm sure Assemblyman Jang
will be disgraced

467
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,550
but it's not a situation
we can do anything about.

468
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,640
- And?
- As for Madam Choi Yoo Jin...

469
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,050
she should be investigated
if only as a potential witness.

470
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,740
She's a victim in this
defamation scandal, after all.

471
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,550
Really? And?

472
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,850
What do you mean "and?"

473
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,350
If something suspicious does turn
up during the investigation

474
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:33,140
and Ms. Ume's death may have been due to
foul play just as Ms. Anna suspected...

475
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,240
Then you'll re-investigate the
circumstances of Ms. Ume Hye Rin's death?

476
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,950
Well, duh.

477
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,350
Really? I'm writing about
this as an exclusive!

478
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,550
Don't share this with anyone else until

- Just a moment!
- Stop!

491
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,050
- Just for a moment, Father!
- Please!

492
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,350
Madam Choi! The police say that they
will re-open Ms. Ume Hye Rin's case!

493
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,850
Have you heard about that?

494
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,550
Is it true that there was a witness
at the scene of the murder?

495
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,240
You may be called in as a suspect
instead of just a witness!

496
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,050
Were you aware of that?
Please say something for us!

497
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,640
Please leave.
She'll do an interview later.

00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:53,050
<i>was taken to the emergency room
this morning while volunteering.</i>

510
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,140
<i>Ms. Choi, who is currently
a victim of a malicious post online...</i>

511
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,640
Wow, looks like Big Sis
sure was in a rush!

512
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,950
She thought to hide at the
hospital, even with that temper of hers!

513
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,850
Wait, so you're saying that
Madam Choi really passed out?

514
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,240
She wasn't putting on an act?

515
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,240
Yes, it seems that way.

516
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,740
Wow, no way!

517
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,140
She's the type to not shed blood in
public even when she's been shot!

518
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,140
I'm sure that she was
just putting on a show.

519
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,640
I wish that were the case, but...

520
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,950
Hey, don't worry!

521
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,240
I'm sure that this was all
part of some plan she had!

522
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,640
Oh, geez.

523
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,140
The claim that Madam Choi
gave birth to Anna is ridiculous

524
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,140
but she didn't even know that
Ms. Ume knew Mr. Lafelt

525
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,050
and only acted later as if she did.

526
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,140
And yet she says that she knows
nothing about Ume Hye Rin's death

527
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,240
even though the entire
situation was quite fishy.

528
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,950
And on top of all that, there's
even a rumor going around

529
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,740
that there was a witness to
Ms. Ume Hye Rin's murder!

530
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,850
Why not write about facts like
a real reporter if you really are one?

531
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,850
Why, you little...

532
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,740
What a dirty, rotten world this is.

533
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,240
People who loved
Madam Choi up until yesterday

534
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,350
are now writing
the nastiest comments about her.

535
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,640
Who do you mean?
Choi Yoo Jin?

536
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,240
Who else?

537
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,640
- What about Jang Se Joon?
- A lot more people pity him than not.

538
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,640
Really?

539
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,140
Isn't that obvious?

540
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,350
He may have been living with a woman who
had another man's child this whole time.

541
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:29,240
Yeah. And if this is true, Ms. Angel's
name will be dragged through the mud.

542
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,550
Aw, man.

543
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:46,550
Um, she's refusing to come out.

544
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,740
Really? I'll have to go to her then.

545
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,740
He didn't show when she was actually
waiting for him, and look at him now.

546
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,950
Anna.

547
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,140
Anna?

548
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,240
<i>Open the door.</i>

549
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:14,950
<i>Anna.</i>

550
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,240
<i>Let's talk, face-to-face.</i>

551
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,450
I have something to
talk to you about.

552
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,950
I have nothing to talk to
you about, so please leave.

553
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,350
I think you'll have to hurry
and go see Chairman Choi, sir.

554
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,240
I'll leave for today then, Anna.

555
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,240
See you next time, okay?

556
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,950
Master Song!

557
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,950
Hey, is Madam Choi inside?

558
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,640
She is, but... what brings you here?

559
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,050
What else?

560
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,240
She's sick, so I'm here
to visit her, obviously!

561
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,550
Just go back home, sir.

562
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,050
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Please leave, sir.

563
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,240
Hey, how dare you stand in my way!

564
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,850
Sir, she's sick right now!

565
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,140
<i>Get out of my way, punk!
I'm going in there!</i>

566
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,640
<i>- But...
- Shut it, punks!</i>

567
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,550
<i>- Please leave!
- Move!</i>

568
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,050
<i>- Master Song!
- Move!</i>

569
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,550
<i>- Just leave, please!
- Move!</i>

570
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,550
I told you to move!

571
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,550
Madam Choi!
It's me, Song Young Choon!

572
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,640
- I told you, she's not well!
- Shut it!

573
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,850
What the hell are you all doing?

574
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,050
Let him in, Chief Kim.

575
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,550
What?

576
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,850
See, you punks? Bunch of runts.

577
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,740
How are you feeling, Madam?

578
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:07,550
Please take one of these, Madam.

579
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,350
What are you doing?

580
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,550
It's the juice that I used to love.

581
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,850
Yes, that's right. You always wanted
this whenever you were ill.

582
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,850
- So they still make this, huh?
- Yes, ma'am.

583
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,350
Delicious.

584
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,450
Right? It's good, huh?

585
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,740
Master Song!

586
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,550
Step out, all of you.

587
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,640
I want to have a private
conversation with Master Song.

588
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,950
I really do feel a bit better
now that I've had this.

589
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,550
Really? What a relief.

590
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,350
Please get better soon, Madam!

591
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,350
You can just use informal
speech with me. It's okay, Mister.

592
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,640
Huh?

593
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,640
Is that okay?

594
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,350
Well... Yoo Jin.

595
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,050
Yes, Mister?

596
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:20,350
Leave Anna alone, if you can.

597
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:27,850
You came here to tell me that?

598
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,240
Yeah.

599
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,550
If you shoot a female animal when hunting
you're supposed to let the babies live.

600
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,140
Mister.

601
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,740
You're making me really uncomfortable.

602
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,140
Yoo Jin. If your father, the late
Chairman Choi, were alive

603
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,550
I'm sure that he'd be
against doing this too.

604
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Mister!

605
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,050
If you're really going to
continue being like this...

606
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,450
I won't be able to do what
my morals tell me to do.

607
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,450
See Master Song out!

608
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,450
Oh, Brother-in-Law!
Please, take a seat.

609
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,140
Someone else's house is in flames,
and yet it feels like a party here.

610
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,550
It is a party.

611
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,140
But it seems that you don't
know who this party is for.

612
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,350
Who else would it be for?
It's for Assemblyman Jang, of course.

613
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,950
Seems like you were quite worried
because of your wife, Assemblyman Jang.

614
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,950
Didn't that post online make
you feel anything, Brother-in-Law?

615
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,880
Like what?

616
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,640
You were conveniently
left out of this entire mess!

617
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,550
You'll rise to the top,
just as we planned.

618
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,350
Cast Choi Yoo Jin aside now.

619
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,450
It'll be a win-win situation if you do!

621
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,850
Are you okay?

622
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,850
I'm okay.

623
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,740
Why didn't you see your dad?

624
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,950
I don't need him.

625
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:32,240
Anna, I know you've been going
around with Chairman Choi a lot.

626
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,140
But Choi Yoo Jin isn't the type of person
to dirty her hands like that.

627
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:41,240
And if there really was a witness, she
would be aware of the danger they pose

628
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,850
and definitely
wouldn't have let them live.

629
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,050
That's not the case this time, though.

630
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,850
But...

631
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,350
are you on my side
or Choi Yoo Jin's side?

632
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,150
What do you mean by that?
Of course I'm on your side!

633
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,150
Why do you stick around
Choi Yoo Jin all the time, then?

634
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:06,850
Mi Ran and Sung Gyu quit working at
JSS to work for JB Group's chairman.

635
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,250
But you're still at JSS.

636
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,050
What are you and Choi Yoo Jin up to?

637
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,650
Anna.

638
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,670
The reason why I'm purposely not telling
you what I'm doing with Choi Yoo Jin...

639
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,950
is because it'd be best
if you didn't know.

640
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:33,950
<i>Because it involves killing someone.</i>

641
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,050
All right!

642
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:44,180
This is whiskey that's
been aged 40 years!

643
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,850
Are you sure that
this isn't a fake?

644
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,350
What? Fake?

645
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:51,150
Hey, I-I went to the store myself, and...

646
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,250
You took out a fake "insurance policy,"
so who knows? This might be fake too.

647
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,650
Oh, is that what
this is all about?

648
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:05,050
I'm sorry. That's why I'm buying
you this expensive liquor, after all.

649
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,750
Here, pour me a shot.

650
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,750
All right, then. Cheers.

651
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,350
Well, how is it?
Is it good?

652
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,950
Well, the taste is...

653
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,550
It's amazing, isn't it?

654
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,050
It sure is!

655
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,750
No, no. Allow me.

656
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,450
Sure, sure.

657
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:47,550
Well, then. Are you here to get
information about Choi Yoo Jin?

658
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:50,550
No, no need for that!
It's all clear as day anyway.

659
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,650
It'll be a bit difficult this time.

660
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,250
Well, that still doesn't
mean impossible, right?

661
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,550
Oh, but still,
regardless of the outcome...

662
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:05,050
Assemblyman Jang will still be
able to become president, right?

663
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,650
Also, Madam's reputation
may have been dealt some blows now

664
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:13,750
but Assemblyman Jang is
okay, so don't worry.

665
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,850
Then...

666
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,650
are you here to lay down some
sort of groundwork by using me?

667
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,350
Lay groundwork?
Of course not!

668
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:29,150
You have to stick right by
Park Kwan Soo's side.

669
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,650
- What?
- That way, I can follow your lead!

670
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,850
What's this, though? Looks like your
trust in Assemblyman Park has crumbled.

671
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:40,950
Then should I follow your lead
and switch sides to Assemblyman Jang?

672
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,450
Of course!

673
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,650
You've already shown
all your cards to me!

674
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,550
You don't need to worry about a thing!

675
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,650
Wow, how nice!

676
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,950
You get to have your cake and eat it too!

677
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:58,450
If we play both sides, we'll emerge
victorious no matter what!

678
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,250
You're absolutely right!

679
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,650
All right, then.
Let's drink up!

680
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,050
Yes, Senior!

681
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:30,950
I wouldn't be too shocked if you
really did kill Anna's mother.

682
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,050
I'm sure there's tons of
people you've gotten killed, anyway.

683
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,250
So I'd like it if you were honest
with me at the very least.

684
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,050
Why?

685
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,350
Why do you want to know that?

686
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,350
Because of Anna.

687
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,750
Anna firmly believes that
you killed her mother.

688
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:05,650
But I'm not sure if I should
hold her back or not.

689
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,750
Just let her be.

690
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,150
Let her do whatever she wants.

691
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,650
Fine.

692
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,150
Then let me just ask you this,
out of pure curiosity.

693
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,750
Did you...

694
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,850
kill Ume Hye Rin?

695
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,350
Fine.

696
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:50,250
I'll be honest, just with you.

697
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,350
I...

698
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,550
didn't kill Ume Hye Rin.

699
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:05,150
And I definitely didn't order
anyone to either.

700
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:14,550
So why did you let Assemblyman Jang
and Anna believe that up until now?

701
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,450
Because that's the only way...

702
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:23,450
that Jang Se Joon will truly believe
that I am capable of killing Anna.

703
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,950
Because that's the only way...

704
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,950
that I could ensure
that Jang Se Joon

705
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:40,050
could not leave me
that night, or ever.

706
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,750
And I...

707
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,650
know who the real murderer is.

708
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,450
But...

709
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,350
I can never say who it is.

710
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,970
If there's anything else
you're curious about

711
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,650
go and ask Mirror.

712
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,350
Mirror knows everything about me.

713
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,050
I've configured her so that
she'll obey you from now on too.

714
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,750
You're the only one with
that power besides me.

715
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:35,350
All I can do now is head
to the police office.

716
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,550
And I'll face the investigation
with confidence.

717
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:46,050
But I don't know what my
enemies will do in the meantime.

718
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,450
So someone needs to be able to access
Mirror while I'm gone, right?

719
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:56,750
But why is that me, of all people?

720
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,350
Because you trusted me
and deleted that incriminating email.

721
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,450
That email was like your lifeline.

722
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,850
Mirror is a similar existence for me.

723
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,050
It's no different than my own life.

724
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,150
And I'm entrusting it to you.

725
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,750
Oh no, I forgot to knock again.
My bad.

726
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,650
Oh?

727
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,250
What's with this strange mood in the air?

728
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,150
You can leave now.

729
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:17,050
You're doing better
than I'd heard.

730
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,450
Sung Won.

731
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,050
I'm really disappointed in your
writing composition skills.

732
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:31,350
What are you talking about? I've even
received an award for my writing before.

733
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,350
Don't do something that
you'll regret later.

734
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,950
If you do, I might just destroy
the company too.

735
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,450
Give JSS to me, then.

736
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:45,050
Wait, no. You can keep JSS.
Just give me Cloud Nine.

737
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,550
That'll solve everything.

738
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,850
Sung Won.

739
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,350
Lately, I've been thinking...

740
01:03:52,640 --> 01:04:00,150
about why Father gave JSS to me
while he made you the next chairman.

741
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:07,150
We needed Jin Han's help back then
to survive, so it was a strategic move.

742
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,950
But maybe he did this in
order to prevent JB Group

743
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,850
from being swallowed up
by Jin Han Group later on.

744
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:18,770
Why do you think that your greedy
father-in-law, who's eyeing JB Group

745
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:23,050
is so antsy about not
having Cloud Nine?

746
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:30,950
Father just didn't think that Jin Han
could be swallowed up by JB Group.

747
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,350
Big Sis.

748
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:41,450
If I trusted my father-in-law,
JB wouldn't still be alive and kicking.

749
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:43,650
Especially with that greedy
old geezer eyeing it for himself.

750
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:48,350
If I wasn't being held back by
Cloud Nine and its watch over me

751
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:51,250
Jin Han probably would've been
swallowed up by JB by now.

752
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,950
I see.

753
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,850
What a relief...

754
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:07,750
that you don't take
after your mother.

755
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:14,250
Fine. Just pick some of JB's
subsidiaries that you want.

756
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,550
They're yours.

757
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,150
Wow, I'm brought to tears.

758
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:19,150
Well, that's what family
is for, after all!

759
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:23,250
But you know, you won't have
much time to think things over.

760
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,550
You'll have to choose quickly

761
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,370
whether or not you want to
undergo a simple witness investigation

762
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:32,950
or be arrested for
Ume Hye Rin's murder.

763
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:39,140
Mirror. Do you know who I am?

764
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,750
<i>Yes, you're Agent Kim Je Ha.</i>

765
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,140
All right.

766
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,250
Can you answer my questions for me?

767
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,640
<i>Yes. Agent Kim Je Ha
has access authority over me.</i>

768
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,350
Are there any limitations
to what I can access?

769
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,350
<i>No, sir.</i>

770
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:58,450
So I can ask you whatever
I want to ask you?

771
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,050
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

772
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,730
Does that include questions
regarding Madam Choi Yoo Jin?

773
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:04,550
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

774
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:23,950
What did you want to see me
so early in the morning about?

775
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,950
I thought it'd appear better if we
head to the police station together

776
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:33,250
since we both have
to go there anyway.

777
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,140
Well, yes, I'm sure.

778
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:47,140
And I'd like you to be next to me.

779
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,250
What, do you need someone
to support you?

780
01:07:55,350 --> 01:08:00,250
Shall I send you some of my bodyguards?

781
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,750
They're coming!

782
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:42,450
- Madam, please say something!
- Please, anything!

783
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,950
To the reporters.

784
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,250
<i>And...</i>

785
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,550
<i>to the citizens of this country.</i>

786
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:08,050
I'm sorry that I withheld the truth
from all of you for all this time.

787
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:17,550
Everything is due to
my own shortcomings.

788
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:37,140
My Anna...

789
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,550
is my real daughter.

790
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:50,950
And Anna is a child who is
like my own daughter to me.

791
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,340
Anna is...

792
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,340
the blood-related daughter...

793
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,950
of my husband,
Assemblyman Jang Se Joon.

794
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:23,340
- What?
- Is this true, Assemblyman Jang?
