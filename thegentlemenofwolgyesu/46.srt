00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Today...</font>

4
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:13,497
<font color=#FFFF00>was our wedding day.</font>

5
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,227
<font color=#FFFF00>And you want to...</font>

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,657
<font color=#FFFF00>stay with Gi Pyo?</font>

7
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:20,427
<font color=#FFFF00>- Because of me... - I've told you it's not your fault.</font>

8
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:22,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Still you want to stay here. Does that mean...</font>

9
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:25,627
<font color=#FFFF00>that he's more important to you than me?</font>

10
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:28,227
<font color=#FFFF00>You know it's not like that. Why are you being unreasonable?</font>

11
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:29,927
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I don't know.</font>

12
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,757
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to think only about myself from now on.</font>

13
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home now.</font>

14
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:37,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo's mum collapsed. How can I ignore her?</font>

15
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:41,027
<font color=#FFFF00>The doctor told me to stay with her.</font>

16
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:44,457
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying I don't want you to.</font>

17
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:46,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to be so stubborn until the end?</font>

18
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:49,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,297
<font color=#FFFF00>(Operating Room)</font>

20
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,127
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 46)</font>

21
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,627
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still here.</font>

22
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:44,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I repaired the ruptured intestine.</font>

23
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:45,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Other than that,</font>

24
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,897
<font color=#FFFF00>we were concerned about the head trauma,</font>

25
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:51,257
<font color=#FFFF00>but fortunately, it wasn't deep.</font>

26
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Based on the CT scan,</font>

27
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:56,227
<font color=#FFFF00>the ruptured intestine was the only injury.</font>

28
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:58,197
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll keep him under observation.</font>

29
00:01:58,357 --> 00:01:59,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Doctor.</font>

30
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:01,927
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. - Sure.</font>

31
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:06,957
<font color=#FFFF00>- Wait. - Yes?</font>

32
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you taking him?</font>

33
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,097
<font color=#FFFF00>To the intensive care unit.</font>

34
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,357
<font color=#FFFF00>The intensive care unit?</font>

35
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:15,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

36
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,127
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take him. - Okay.</font>

37
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:19,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

38
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:38,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Yun Shil?</font>

39
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:41,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo's mother fainted.</font>

40
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,627
<font color=#FFFF00>She's at the hospital.</font>

41
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should she care about them?</font>

42
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:49,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should Yun Shil stay and take care of them?</font>

43
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:53,897
<font color=#FFFF00>She can't just leave them both knowing that someone collapsed.</font>

44
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,627
<font color=#FFFF00>He got us in this mess...</font>

45
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,857
<font color=#FFFF00>and she wants to stay with him?</font>

46
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Has Yun Shil lost her mind?</font>

47
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,257
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry, Mum. - You don't have to apologise.</font>

48
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:08,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I gave my consent to the marriage knowing that this would happen.</font>

49
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,357
<font color=#FFFF00>I should be responsible.</font>

50
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:13,527
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been through a lot today. Don't berate him too much.</font>

51
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go and get some rest. We can talk later.</font>

52
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:19,597
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have you eaten? - Yes.</font>

53
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:22,757
<font color=#FFFF00>This is such an embarrassment.</font>

54
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,927
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry, Dad. - Try to understand.</font>

55
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:33,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil's kind-hearted and generous.</font>

56
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:35,927
<font color=#FFFF00>When she sees someone in need or trouble,</font>

57
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:39,097
<font color=#FFFF00>she just can't ignore them, that's why.</font>

58
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:41,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I try to understand...</font>

59
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,397
<font color=#FFFF00>but I keep getting angry.</font>

60
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,297
<font color=#FFFF00>The man who loved her for years is now in hospital...</font>

61
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:51,427
<font color=#FFFF00>and now his mother also fainted.</font>

62
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,157
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure that...</font>

63
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:55,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil just can't turn away from them.</font>

64
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,427
<font color=#FFFF00>You can vent your anger at least,</font>

65
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:00,897
<font color=#FFFF00>but she has no one to turn to.</font>

66
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Do what you did until now...</font>

67
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:08,027
<font color=#FFFF00>and be a man and look out for her.</font>

68
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:10,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Comfort her.</font>

69
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,257
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Dong Jin and Na Yun Shil)</font>

70
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:41,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you asleep?</font>

71
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:43,557
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

72
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:47,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this the new bed?</font>

73
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,867
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nice and bouncy.</font>

74
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

75
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,027
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, of course. - You must feel downcast.</font>

76
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:58,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Come upstairs for a drink.</font>

77
00:04:58,427 --> 00:04:59,497
<font color=#FFFF00>No thanks.</font>

78
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:02,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't enjoy your first night without your bride.</font>

79
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:04,227
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll comfort you with a few drinks.</font>

80
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,157
<font color=#FFFF00>- But... - Come along.</font>

81
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Just look at the colour. Isn't it great?</font>

82
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:10,597
<font color=#FFFF00>It's perfectly cooked.</font>

83
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:13,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

84
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:15,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I invited myself.</font>

85
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:19,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I called our brothers in case Dong Jin was in a funk.</font>

86
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for helping out today.</font>

87
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:25,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too preoccupied to thank you earlier.</font>

88
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,927
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to thank us.</font>

89
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,997
<font color=#FFFF00>We're brothers, so forget about formalities.</font>

90
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:31,827
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's all sit. - Sure.</font>

91
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit.</font>

92
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Here comes the stew.</font>

93
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:37,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

94
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:39,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Dong Jin.</font>

95
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:42,257
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've been really stressed.</font>

96
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:44,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You've lost weight in just a day.</font>

97
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, Dong Sook, Sun Nyeo.</font>

98
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:48,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should you apologise?</font>

99
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,597
<font color=#FFFF00>That was brazen of him.</font>

100
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:53,227
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare he even kidnap the bride on her wedding day?</font>

101
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:56,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Jerks like that should be left to suffer with really...</font>

102
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:58,457
<font color=#FFFF00>hard and bloody stools.</font>

103
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,197
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hard and bloody stools... - Sun Nyeo.</font>

104
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,157
<font color=#FFFF00>We're trying to eat here.</font>

105
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I just lost my appetite.</font>

106
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:07,927
<font color=#FFFF00>My bad. I got just a bit carried away.</font>

107
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't Yun Shil with you?</font>

108
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,427
<font color=#FFFF00>She's at the hospital.</font>

109
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:14,127
<font color=#FFFF00>The hospital? Why?</font>

110
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:18,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she at the hospital Gi Pyo was admitted to?</font>

111
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:20,297
<font color=#FFFF00>It was an emergency.</font>

112
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,857
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care if it is.</font>

113
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Who cares if he lives or dies?</font>

114
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:26,057
<font color=#FFFF00>What business does she have with him?</font>

115
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:28,257
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, don't get too excited.</font>

116
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,357
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I not get excited?</font>

117
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:33,997
<font color=#FFFF00>The wedding was in a mess because of them.</font>

118
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:36,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does she care whether he dies or not?</font>

119
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Does she still have feelings for him?</font>

120
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:41,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, seriously. What are you talking about now?</font>

121
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,727
<font color=#FFFF00>They say that hateful passion lasts longer than love.</font>

122
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:46,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Unlike how Yun Shil talks about him, she might actually...</font>

123
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:48,657
<font color=#FFFF00>- still have feelings for... - Stop.</font>

124
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Ladies, please leave.</font>

125
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:52,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry? - Pardon?</font>

126
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,357
<font color=#FFFF00>There's something we need...</font>

127
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:57,457
<font color=#FFFF00>to talk about man to man, so get up and leave, please.</font>

128
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,227
<font color=#FFFF00>What secret will you talk about behind our backs?</font>

129
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,327
<font color=#FFFF00>If I tell you, it's no longer a secret.</font>

130
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:03,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't mind us and leave us alone.</font>

131
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:06,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, Honey. There's a bunch of things we need to talk about.</font>

132
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:08,797
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Okay.</font>

133
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,557
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thanks for the food. - No problem. Let's have a drink.</font>

134
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:14,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Guys, let's drink, too.</font>

135
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,057
<font color=#FFFF00>- Cheers. - Cheers.</font>

136
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:24,957
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a little embarrassing to compliment ourselves,</font>

137
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:27,827
<font color=#FFFF00>but the four of us were so amazing today.</font>

138
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:31,127
<font color=#FFFF00>It was almost like "Mission Impossible".</font>

139
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:34,557
<font color=#FFFF00>My flying kicks knocked those punks out like this.</font>

140
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:37,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt like I was Tom Cruise.</font>

141
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:39,857
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you do flying kicks?</font>

142
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:42,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you didn't see it because I was too fast.</font>

143
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Following the flying kick, I gave them a double side kick...</font>

144
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:46,457
<font color=#FFFF00>and knocked them straight out.</font>

145
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:49,127
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what got them.</font>

146
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:50,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin. You saw that, right?</font>

147
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry? Well, I'm not sure.</font>

148
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung, you're a liar.</font>

149
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Liar? Watch yourself!</font>

150
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,727
<font color=#FFFF00>We can enjoy pork belly and soju like this because they were drunk.</font>

151
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:04,227
<font color=#FFFF00>If they weren't, we could've been the ones at the hospital now.</font>

152
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:07,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, that fool. He's such a downer.</font>

153
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,597
<font color=#FFFF00>He doesn't understand how men's world works.</font>

154
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,227
<font color=#FFFF00>He's ruining the taste of this soju.</font>

155
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:13,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry. - Anyhow, good work today, everyone.</font>

156
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:16,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you guys, I could save Yun Shil.</font>

157
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,827
<font color=#FFFF00>How's that guy, Hong Gi Pyo?</font>

158
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,057
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think he has gained his consciousness yet.</font>

159
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:23,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, love is so tough.</font>

160
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,097
<font color=#FFFF00>It makes so many people's lives difficult.</font>

161
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:28,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

162
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,227
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why wouldn't I be? - You had...</font>

163
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,727
<font color=#FFFF00>a crazy fight with Sun Nyeo because of your first love.</font>

164
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,497
<font color=#FFFF00>To be exact, that wasn't really a fight. I almost...</font>

165
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:39,467
<font color=#FFFF00>died in Sun Nyeo's hands.</font>

166
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,757
<font color=#FFFF00>After meeting my first love again, I realised that no man...</font>

167
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,967
<font color=#FFFF00>should run into his first love again in his life.</font>

168
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung. You should be careful, too.</font>

169
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:51,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I'd never run into my first love again.</font>

170
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:54,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang.</font>

171
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:58,397
<font color=#FFFF00>How's your love life going after dumping Da Jeong?</font>

172
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:01,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Not well. Hyo Won's mum threw roasted chestnuts at me today.</font>

173
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:02,967
<font color=#FFFF00>- Roasted chestnuts? - Roasted chestnuts?</font>

174
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,027
<font color=#FFFF00>She hasn't been in the greatest mood these days,</font>

175
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,557
<font color=#FFFF00>so I bought some roasted chestnuts for her to win some points,</font>

176
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,357
<font color=#FFFF00>but she threw them all at me.</font>

177
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:13,557
<font color=#FFFF00>I took a quick look at her the other day, and she was very charismatic.</font>

178
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I could tell that she has a bit of a temper.</font>

179
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, none of us has it easy.</font>

180
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,897
<font color=#FFFF00>It must hurt to have chestnuts thrown at you.</font>

181
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Were they peeled or not?</font>

182
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,157
<font color=#FFFF00>- They weren't peeled. - Goodness.</font>

183
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:26,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's drink up.</font>

184
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,127
<font color=#FFFF00>(Ms Shiny Eyes)</font>

185
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:34,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, right?</font>

186
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:37,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me fill your glass.</font>

187
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,797
<font color=#FFFF00>The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.</font>

188
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Please leave a message after the tone.</font>

189
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,027
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be really mad at me.</font>

190
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

191
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Gi Pyo?</font>

192
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:17,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is my son?</font>

193
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo!</font>

194
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:24,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down. You might faint again if you get worked up.</font>

195
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,097
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Calm down?</font>

196
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:28,527
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I calm down when my son is hovering between life and death?</font>

197
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:29,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is he?</font>

198
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:31,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Gi Pyo now?</font>

199
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,657
<font color=#FFFF00>He was moved to the intensive care unit.</font>

200
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:36,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Intensive care unit?</font>

201
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

202
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:44,467
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to see my son. Take me to the intensive care unit.</font>

203
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Lead the way!</font>

204
00:10:56,357 --> 00:11:01,227
<font color=#FFFF00>(Intensive Care Unit)</font>

205
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:06,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You aren't allowed in here, Ma'am.</font>

206
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:08,697
<font color=#FFFF00>My son is in there. I'd like to see him.</font>

207
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,857
<font color=#FFFF00>You can only see him during designated visiting hours.</font>

208
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:13,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Please read the sign by the entrance and come back during the hours.</font>

209
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:15,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me see him for a few seconds.</font>

210
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I fainted all of a sudden,</font>

211
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,427
<font color=#FFFF00>so I couldn't see my son.</font>

212
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. Please come back during the visiting hours.</font>

213
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:30,597
<font color=#FFFF00>The universe is just heartless.</font>

214
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:34,627
<font color=#FFFF00>He went through such a hard time in jail...</font>

215
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,397
<font color=#FFFF00>and got out just a few days ago.</font>

216
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:40,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does his life have to hang by a thread?</font>

217
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:46,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo, I'm going to die with you if you don't survive this.</font>

218
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:49,557
<font color=#FFFF00>The doctor said that you might faint again if you aren't careful.</font>

219
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

220
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:55,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo. Gosh, Gi Pyo.</font>

221
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo...</font>

222
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am.</font>

223
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

224
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:09,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you let that happen to Gi Pyo? Where have you guys been?</font>

225
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:11,997
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys are so useless.</font>

226
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:16,327
<font color=#FFFF00>We were hungry, so we went to eat pork belly over some soju.</font>

227
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,227
<font color=#FFFF00>We're sorry.</font>

228
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:23,057
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all Yun Shil's fault.</font>

229
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:28,227
<font color=#FFFF00>If you go back to that jerk at the tailor shop after this,</font>

230
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,397
<font color=#FFFF00>both you and that jerk...</font>

231
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,497
<font color=#FFFF00>will die in our hands.</font>

232
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:34,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

233
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

234
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:41,427
<font color=#FFFF00>You had no idea what was happening to Gi Pyo and just got beaten up.</font>

235
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,897
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you blabber away!</font>

236
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,357
<font color=#FFFF00>You punks love to look menacing,</font>

237
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:47,397
<font color=#FFFF00>but you're actually completely useless.</font>

238
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:48,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Just leave!</font>

239
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:51,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Please. You're being too harsh on us.</font>

240
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,727
<font color=#FFFF00>We've done our best to serve Gi Pyo over the years.</font>

241
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:57,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why is he bedridden like that right now? Tell me!</font>

242
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:02,557
<font color=#FFFF00>This is exactly why I told him to stay away from stupid guys like you.</font>

243
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Get lost.</font>

244
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:07,097
<font color=#FFFF00>- Guys, let's go. - Okay.</font>

245
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:09,357
<font color=#FFFF00>You stupid jerks. Goodness.</font>

246
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil.</font>

247
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:18,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Those blokes must have been harassing you.</font>

248
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,727
<font color=#FFFF00>That's probably why you fell for the owner of the tailor shop.</font>

249
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:23,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, Yun Shil.</font>

250
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:28,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo is different from those ignorant and rude jerks.</font>

251
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:32,157
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, he's bedridden like that because he risked his life twice...</font>

252
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:33,727
<font color=#FFFF00>for the woman he loves.</font>

253
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:37,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

254
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:41,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't. Please don't apologise to me.</font>

255
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I beg you.</font>

256
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:48,457
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise I won't be mean to you.</font>

257
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,757
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll treat you like my own daughter, so please save Gi Pyo's life.</font>

258
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:55,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if he survives this, he'll strangle himself...</font>

259
00:13:55,497 --> 00:13:58,497
<font color=#FFFF00>or drug himself to death if you tell him that you want to end it.</font>

260
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:01,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't do this. This won't change anything.</font>

261
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:04,757
<font color=#FFFF00>If you leave Gi Pyo, he'll die.</font>

262
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:08,997
<font color=#FFFF00>If he dies, I'm going to die with him as well.</font>

263
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:14,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Two people's lives depend on you.</font>

264
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won needs to wave the white flag.</font>

265
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:42,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, I can put an end to acting like I have aphasia.</font>

266
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried about the company, too.</font>

267
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't really afford to be stuck at home like this now.</font>

268
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, I'm coming in.</font>

269
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to sleep beside you tonight.</font>

270
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Repeat after me, okay?</font>

271
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,657
<font color=#FFFF00>A, b, c, d,</font>

272
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,597
<font color=#FFFF00>e, f and g.</font>

273
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's hard, but you have to keep practising.</font>

274
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,757
<font color=#FFFF00>What if you really forget how to talk?</font>

275
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:28,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Repeat after me.</font>

276
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,097
<font color=#FFFF00>A, b, c, d,</font>

277
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,127
<font color=#FFFF00>e, f and g.</font>

278
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:45,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, I'm so sorry...</font>

279
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:54,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry, Mum...</font>

280
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't even talk because of me.</font>

281
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,197
<font color=#FFFF00>My poor mum.</font>

282
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:05,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, I'm so sorry.</font>

283
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum...</font>

284
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:20,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

285
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:23,827
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I do to help you talk again?</font>

286
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:30,127
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do to help you start talking again?</font>

287
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,097
<font color=#FFFF00>(Kang Tae Yang)</font>

288
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,527
<font color=#FFFF00>(Break up with Kang Tae Yang.)</font>

289
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you can speak again...</font>

290
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,397
<font color=#FFFF00>if I break up with Tae Yang?</font>

291
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:48,857
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

292
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:52,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do anything except this.</font>

293
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:54,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I can never do this.</font>

294
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:57,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

295
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:02,927
<font color=#FFFF00>It hurts, Mum.</font>

296
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:07,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to get out?</font>

297
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:10,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

298
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go. Calm down, Mum.</font>

299
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,857
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a good actress.</font>

300
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:40,727
<font color=#FFFF00>You deserve the Academy Best Actress Award.</font>

301
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,697
<font color=#FFFF00>She is so stubborn.</font>

302
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Even when her mum can't speak for many days,</font>

303
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:51,557
<font color=#FFFF00>she doesn't say that she would break up with Kang Tae Yang.</font>

304
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, Hyo Won wouldn't say such a thing.</font>

305
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:57,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Only you would keep feeling heavy and infuriated.</font>

306
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:00,227
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should stop acting now. - So why did you...</font>

307
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:04,927
<font color=#FFFF00>marry Choi Ji Yun and make this kind of trouble?</font>

308
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,457
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

309
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,527
<font color=#FFFF00>If only I had known earlier,</font>

310
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I would have separated you and Choi Ji Yun.</font>

311
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,097
<font color=#FFFF00>So do you mean...</font>

312
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:16,727
<font color=#FFFF00>it would have been better if you accepted Kang Tae Yang, not Ji Yun?</font>

313
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean that?</font>

314
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:20,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Frankly speaking,</font>

315
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I like Kang Tae Yang...</font>

316
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,297
<font color=#FFFF00>more than Ji Yun.</font>

317
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake up, Mum!</font>

318
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Tae Yang is such a jerk.</font>

319
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,527
<font color=#FFFF00>He had a grudge against Ji Yun,</font>

320
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,667
<font color=#FFFF00>so he intentionally approached to Hyo Won.</font>

321
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:35,227
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

322
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:38,357
<font color=#FFFF00>How is the company now?</font>

323
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you bring that oriental medicine to Mum?</font>

324
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Right, Hyo Won.</font>

325
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Give it to me. I'll bring it to Mum.</font>

326
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,057
<font color=#FFFF00>She suffers so much for love.</font>

327
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have focused on suits.</font>

328
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:06,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you launch outdoor look and make such a trouble?</font>

329
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I know that things will turn out this way?</font>

330
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:13,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that Mum's voice?</font>

331
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,667
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Mum.</font>

332
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,457
<font color=#FFFF00>As I promised some revenue to major shareholders,</font>

333
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:25,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I needed to make a new revenue model.</font>

334
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:26,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum agreed to it,</font>

335
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:29,427
<font color=#FFFF00>and told me to work with Hyo Won. Why are you doing this now?</font>

336
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, you should have done it within the range...</font>

337
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,397
<font color=#FFFF00>that the company can withstand.</font>

338
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, when we launch a new line,</font>

339
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,957
<font color=#FFFF00>we need a full scale advertisement in the early stage...</font>

340
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:41,227
<font color=#FFFF00>to draw attention for the new brand.</font>

341
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,827
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't be helpful at all if we advertise...</font>

342
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,057
<font color=#FFFF00>in a small scale.</font>

343
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:48,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing my best myself.</font>

344
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so tired.</font>

345
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,527
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that I have many children.</font>

346
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I only have two children,</font>

347
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:57,027
<font color=#FFFF00>and they make me worry in turn.</font>

348
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:02,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum,</font>

349
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:05,557
<font color=#FFFF00>- you can speak well. - Well,</font>

350
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:09,497
<font color=#FFFF00>that's, Hyo Won...</font>

351
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:10,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Then,</font>

352
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,957
<font color=#FFFF00>have you been lying to me all along?</font>

353
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:15,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, that's...</font>

354
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:18,097
<font color=#FFFF00>it's not like that.</font>

355
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:19,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to me.</font>

356
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

357
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

358
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know that. I was so worried.</font>

359
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:31,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Please.</font>

360
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:33,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

361
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you keep talking to me and make this happen?</font>

362
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:41,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you blame me every time something happens?</font>

363
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:44,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won, Hyo Won!</font>

364
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

365
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:55,357
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing now?</font>

366
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so disappointed with you.</font>

367
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,097
<font color=#FFFF00>It's natural that you got it wrong.</font>

368
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:03,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I just got to speak again right before you came.</font>

369
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,427
<font color=#FFFF00>After you came out of my room,</font>

370
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang came in and then I suddenly...</font>

371
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,057
<font color=#FFFF00>could speak again.</font>

372
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:11,997
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's a lie. - No, it isn't.</font>

373
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:15,167
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a lie. It's true. You can ask Hyo Sang.</font>

374
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how much I was troubled all along?</font>

375
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:19,827
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this to me?</font>

376
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:22,457
<font color=#FFFF00>If only you said you would break up with Kang Tae Yang earlier,</font>

377
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,397
<font color=#FFFF00>things would not have turned out like this.</font>

378
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:28,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I can never break up with Tae Yang if you act like this.</font>

379
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,357
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where are you going? - It's none of your business.</font>

380
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going to Kang Tae Yang? - Never mind.</font>

381
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Min Hyo Won!</font>

382
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:40,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop right there!</font>

383
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:46,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won, Hyo Won!</font>

384
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,827
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where are you going, Hyo Won? - Hold her so that she can't go out!</font>

385
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hold her now! - All right.</font>

386
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:56,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold her.</font>

387
00:21:57,697 --> 00:21:58,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of my way.</font>

388
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:00,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother is telling me to stop you.</font>

389
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:02,827
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can't go. - Can't you imagine...</font>

390
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,027
<font color=#FFFF00>why I even acted?</font>

391
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,697
<font color=#FFFF00>So, give up on Kang Tae Yang.</font>

392
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,457
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I would never give up on him.</font>

393
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:12,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Kang Tae Yang more important to you than your mum who gave...</font>

394
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:14,827
<font color=#FFFF00>birth to you and your own brother?</font>

395
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:16,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure about that,</font>

396
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,397
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't live if I break up with Tae Yang.</font>

397
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,697
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say such a thing in front of Mother, Hyo Won?</font>

398
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,557
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

399
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:28,597
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go.</font>

400
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:32,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll realise how precious I am after having a hard time outside.</font>

401
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Just let her leave. Get her out of the house.</font>

402
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:42,897
<font color=#FFFF00>What if she shacks up with Kang Tae Yang, Mother?</font>

403
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:45,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Tae Yang would never do such a thing.</font>

404
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,457
<font color=#FFFF00>He's an upright person.</font>

405
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,727
<font color=#FFFF00>He would never shack up without the consent from parents.</font>

406
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,357
<font color=#FFFF00>She favours Tae Yang so much.</font>

407
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:02,397
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, she can speak now.</font>

408
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:06,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, Mother!</font>

409
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm tired.</font>

410
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:18,557
<font color=#FFFF00>It was such a long day.</font>

411
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:25,657
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I shouldn't do this.</font>

412
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:31,057
<font color=#FFFF00>I should lie down on this bed with Ms Shiny Eyes.</font>

413
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:34,227
<font color=#FFFF00>My shoulder aches.</font>

414
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,297
<font color=#FFFF00>(Ms Shiny Eyes)</font>

415
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:52,227
<font color=#FFFF00>(Mr Pretty Eyes)</font>

416
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:02,057
<font color=#FFFF00>The phone has been turned off. Please leave a message.</font>

417
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:04,657
<font color=#FFFF00>it's me, Dong Jin.</font>

418
00:24:05,797 --> 00:24:07,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you back home all right?</font>

419
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:09,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to be...</font>

420
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:12,727
<font color=#FFFF00>the most beautiful bride...</font>

421
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,557
<font color=#FFFF00>and be with you.</font>

422
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I couldn't do that.</font>

423
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:22,197
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have been troubled because of me.</font>

424
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:25,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry...</font>

425
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,097
<font color=#FFFF00>that I insisted staying here.</font>

426
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:54,197
<font color=#FFFF00>(Intensive Care Unit)</font>

427
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,227
<font color=#FFFF00>How is Hong Gi Pyo's condition?</font>

428
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:19,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait a minute.</font>

429
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,227
<font color=#FFFF00>(Intensive Care Unit)</font>

430
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:32,597
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not in a serious condition, but he still hasn't woken up yet.</font>

431
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:36,057
<font color=#FFFF00>His doctor says he will wait and see.</font>

432
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:38,957
<font color=#FFFF00>You can see him if you come on visiting hours.</font>

433
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:40,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

434
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:52,357
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that there's a special reason.</font>

435
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:54,227
<font color=#FFFF00>My daughter-in-law...</font>

436
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:56,957
<font color=#FFFF00>was on her way from the beauty salon after her bridal make up...</font>

437
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,157
<font color=#FFFF00>and then she had a car accident.</font>

438
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:01,757
<font color=#FFFF00>No, no.</font>

439
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,757
<font color=#FFFF00>It was not a serious accident. It was just a little fender bender.</font>

440
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

441
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:09,727
<font color=#FFFF00>She went to the hospital for treatment and came home.</font>

442
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:12,497
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

443
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:15,557
<font color=#FFFF00>You came all the way for us.</font>

444
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:18,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. All right.</font>

445
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:20,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Talk to you later.</font>

446
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:26,627
<font color=#FFFF00>What a shame.</font>

447
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,427
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a shame.</font>

448
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:32,557
<font color=#FFFF00>They all think the bride got cold feet.</font>

449
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:36,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin ended up looking like a fool.</font>

450
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:41,227
<font color=#FFFF00>All sorts of things happen to all sorts of people.</font>

451
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:43,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't take it too seriously.</font>

452
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:45,327
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so laid back.</font>

453
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:48,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet you'll live a very long time.</font>

454
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:01,657
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't do that. - Can you stay still?</font>

455
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:03,327
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

456
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:05,957
<font color=#FFFF00>You're tickling me.</font>

457
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,857
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't move. Hold still.</font>

458
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,097
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is too much. - This is so annoying.</font>

459
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:14,457
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get the light. - Okay.</font>

460
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:19,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I know they're newlyweds but this is too much.</font>

461
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:22,497
<font color=#FFFF00>They aren't the only people here. They're so inconsiderate.</font>

462
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:24,927
<font color=#FFFF00>We were newlyweds once, too, you know.</font>

463
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:28,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe they get up to no good every night.</font>

464
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:33,157
<font color=#FFFF00>If they want to get some action, they should at least keep quiet.</font>

465
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:36,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet the whole neighbourhood knows what they're doing.</font>

466
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:40,297
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying. It's infuriating.</font>

467
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:43,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

468
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,227
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

469
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we get some action?</font>

470
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:50,957
<font color=#FFFF00>What action?</font>

471
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:53,227
<font color=#FFFF00>That action.</font>

472
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:56,427
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm tired.</font>

473
00:27:57,357 --> 00:28:00,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't be that tired. You don't even work anymore.</font>

474
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do our homework.</font>

475
00:28:03,757 --> 00:28:04,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we?</font>

476
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,797
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get the light. - Okay.</font>

477
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:15,357
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't done this in a while.</font>

478
00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:17,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy.</font>

479
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:22,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold me tighter, Mr Sam Do.</font>

480
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:24,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here, Sun Nyeo.</font>

481
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:29,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just sleep.</font>

482
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:31,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

483
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:33,457
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't done this in so long that...</font>

484
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,957
<font color=#FFFF00>it feels awkward and weird.</font>

485
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:38,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's sleep.</font>

486
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:40,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, then.</font>

487
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:45,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo, can you scratch my back?</font>

488
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:48,797
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where? - Right there.</font>

489
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,597
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here? - A bit lower.</font>

490
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,527
<font color=#FFFF00>That feels so good.</font>

491
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:56,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Your scratching my back feels much better than doing homework.</font>

492
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,197
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough, thanks.</font>

493
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:04,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you scratch my back now?</font>

494
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:06,227
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't reach. - Where?</font>

495
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:08,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here? - Lower.</font>

496
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:12,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sleepy.</font>

497
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Scratch harder.</font>

498
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:17,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Put your hand inside.</font>

499
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Will she really move in with him?</font>

500
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:31,527
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

501
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't trust my daughter...</font>

502
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:36,227
<font color=#FFFF00>but Tae Yang would never do that.</font>

503
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:49,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mother. Can you speak now?</font>

504
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:51,497
<font color=#FFFF00>A while ago... No.</font>

505
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,627
<font color=#FFFF00>A bit before a while ago...</font>

506
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,457
<font color=#FFFF00>I got my voice back.</font>

507
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:57,657
<font color=#FFFF00>That's great news. Congratulations.</font>

508
00:29:58,027 --> 00:30:00,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't congratulate me. Put Hyo Won on.</font>

509
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:01,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won?</font>

510
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,097
<font color=#FFFF00>- She isn't there? - No.</font>

511
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:05,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did she go?</font>

512
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:07,057
<font color=#FFFF00>She isn't at home?</font>

513
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,457
<font color=#FFFF00>She left home.</font>

514
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:12,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- She packed a suitcase and left. - She did what?</font>

515
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:17,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, honey.</font>

516
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won, did you leave home?</font>

517
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:22,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it my mum?</font>

518
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:28,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't come home until you let me date Tae Yang.</font>

519
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:31,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you being a bit too rash?</font>

520
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,727
<font color=#FFFF00>You crossed the line first.</font>

521
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,597
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you lie about not being able to speak?</font>

522
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:38,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you come home first?</font>

523
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:40,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me explain.</font>

524
00:30:40,857 --> 00:30:42,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me to leave.</font>

525
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:44,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget about it.</font>

526
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:45,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't go home...</font>

527
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:48,527
<font color=#FFFF00>- until you let me... - If you keep on being so bratty,</font>

528
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:52,157
<font color=#FFFF00>I will delete your name from the family registry!</font>

529
00:31:14,397 --> 00:31:18,327
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know having a second house could be such a good thing.</font>

530
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I can leave home without a worry.</font>

531
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:23,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if your mum upset you,</font>

532
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,797
<font color=#FFFF00>you shouldn't have left. Go back right now.</font>

533
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- I don't want to. - Hyo Won.</font>

534
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:31,457
<font color=#FFFF00>How could a mum deceive her own daughter like that?</font>

535
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:33,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea.</font>

536
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:36,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know how worried and scared I was.</font>

537
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,027
<font color=#FFFF00>For a short while,</font>

538
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:42,897
<font color=#FFFF00>a very short while,</font>

539
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:48,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I wondered if I really should break up with you.</font>

540
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

541
00:31:57,297 --> 00:32:00,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't force me to go home.</font>

542
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:05,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever happens, I'll fight until she gives her consent.</font>

543
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:18,327
<font color=#FFFF00>(Saemaeum Hospital)</font>

544
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I said it's not your fault.</font>

545
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:46,597
<font color=#FFFF00>You did more than enough for those two.</font>

546
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:50,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to think it's not my fault, like you say,</font>

547
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:54,427
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't deny that Gi Pyo lost a lot because of me.</font>

548
00:32:54,427 --> 00:32:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>That was his choice to make.</font>

549
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:59,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't want any of that.</font>

550
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I wronged him in so many ways.</font>

551
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:05,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to apologise for first.</font>

552
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:24,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm back.</font>

553
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Dong Jin.</font>

554
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

555
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:39,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mother.</font>

556
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:41,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on inside.</font>

557
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:52,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.</font>

558
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,327
<font color=#FFFF00>You went through much more than we did.</font>

559
00:33:56,957 --> 00:33:58,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you hurt?</font>

560
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:00,327
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

561
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:03,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, you must have been very shocked.</font>

562
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:06,357
<font color=#FFFF00>I was shocked beyond belief.</font>

563
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:10,857
<font color=#FFFF00>What upsets me even more is that you didn't come home...</font>

564
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:12,957
<font color=#FFFF00>to look after the fool who caused this mess.</font>

565
00:34:13,497 --> 00:34:15,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin said she had no choice...</font>

566
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:18,027
<font color=#FFFF00>because both mother and son were unconscious.</font>

567
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:22,157
<font color=#FFFF00>She had a long day and night. Let's not upset her even more.</font>

568
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

569
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:28,097
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do nothing but apologise to you both.</font>

570
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:29,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen carefully, Yun Shil.</font>

571
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,527
<font color=#FFFF00>If you go to the hospital once more,</font>

572
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll consider that you have turned against us.</font>

573
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:38,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean that.</font>

574
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:40,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

575
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:43,567
<font color=#FFFF00>You had a long day. You can go.</font>

576
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:46,127
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

577
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you off to work?</font>

578
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:13,157
<font color=#FFFF00>I was worried because you didn't answer your calls last night.</font>

579
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not a concern of yours.</font>

580
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:18,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Why were you worried?</font>

581
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,927
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't say that.</font>

582
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:23,697
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how important and precious you are to me.</font>

583
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:27,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I was, but yesterday made me rethink all that.</font>

584
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about that. Are you very angry?</font>

585
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,497
<font color=#FFFF00>You did something knowing I'd be angry,</font>

586
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:34,857
<font color=#FFFF00>so why bother apologising?</font>

587
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:39,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't care about me, so do whatever you want from now on.</font>

588
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin.</font>

589
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:17,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have given in so easily...</font>

590
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:20,897
<font color=#FFFF00>knowing something like this would happen.</font>

591
00:36:20,897 --> 00:36:23,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep bringing up the past?</font>

592
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:27,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand it. It's so infuriating.</font>

593
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:37,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad to hear that no one got hurt,</font>

594
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,897
<font color=#FFFF00>but what's going to happen to Mr Lee and Yun Shil now?</font>

595
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,727
<font color=#FFFF00>They never had a wedding,</font>

596
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,527
<font color=#FFFF00>so they're technically not married.</font>

597
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:46,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly. I'm wondering the same thing.</font>

598
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:49,597
<font color=#FFFF00>They're almost like a married couple,</font>

599
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:51,067
<font color=#FFFF00>but we can't say that they're married.</font>

600
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:54,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if they've done their homework yet.</font>

601
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:56,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Dong Jin.</font>

602
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:58,067
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hi, you're early today. - Yes.</font>

603
00:36:58,227 --> 00:36:59,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you heard from Yun Shil?</font>

604
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,127
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw her getting home as I was heading out.</font>

605
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:03,797
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've waited for her to come with her.</font>

606
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:07,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, right. She's probably not in the shape to come back to work yet.</font>

607
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:10,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm meeting with Gianni later today. I should go through the paperwork.</font>

608
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,197
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

609
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,097
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like he's very angry.</font>

610
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:18,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. He's being so cold even to us.</font>

611
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:20,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, that fool.</font>

612
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:31,297
<font color=#FFFF00>(You have a new voicemail. Press the call button to listen to it.)</font>

613
00:37:34,857 --> 00:37:36,397
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Dong Jin.</font>

614
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:38,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get home safely?</font>

615
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Today,</font>

616
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:44,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to be the most beautiful bride in the world...</font>

617
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:46,197
<font color=#FFFF00>and be with you.</font>

618
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:49,157
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I couldn't do that.</font>

619
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:52,567
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how distressed you must have been because of me.</font>

620
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:55,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry that I was stubborn...</font>

621
00:37:55,627 --> 00:37:57,197
<font color=#FFFF00>about staying here.</font>

622
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,397
<font color=#FFFF00>If I turn a blind eye to him...</font>

623
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:04,457
<font color=#FFFF00>and something happens to him,</font>

624
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:08,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't think I could thoroughly enjoy our happiness together.</font>

625
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:12,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I did it for myself.</font>

626
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to run to you...</font>

627
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,697
<font color=#FFFF00>and apologise as soon as the sun comes up,</font>

628
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:22,927
<font color=#FFFF00>so I hope you don't get too upset about this.</font>

629
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Sweet dreams.</font>

630
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:35,357
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have been waiting for me because you knew I was coming.</font>

631
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:39,797
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't even eat breakfast.</font>

632
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:41,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought toast for you.</font>

633
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a bite.</font>

634
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked them to fill it with special ingredients inside.</font>

635
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have any appetite.</font>

636
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. Just take a bite.</font>

637
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,797
<font color=#FFFF00>If you try a bite, it'll change your mind.</font>

638
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:05,157
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a lot of documents to go through. Let me focus on work.</font>

639
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:10,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Then eat while you get your work done.</font>

640
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,357
<font color=#FFFF00>(Fabric Inventory)</font>

641
00:39:43,457 --> 00:39:44,497
<font color=#FFFF00>It must have been so scary for you.</font>

642
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:47,497
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you get any injuries? - No, I'm fine.</font>

643
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:50,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Master Bae, thank you for yesterday.</font>

644
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I just did what I had to do. You don't need to thank me.</font>

645
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:55,227
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, I think Dong Jin is mad.</font>

646
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,497
<font color=#FFFF00>He drank a lot last night.</font>

647
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:59,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I understand why he's mad.</font>

648
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:00,957
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault.</font>

649
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:03,457
<font color=#FFFF00>You're too nice for your own good.</font>

650
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you even care about the guy who's been harassing you?</font>

651
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:09,297
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you ditch your husband to stay at the hospital for that jerk?</font>

652
00:40:09,597 --> 00:40:12,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you're seriously... I don't get you.</font>

653
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:42,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Since my darling doesn't seem to be in the greatest mood today,</font>

654
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:45,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to add an extra spoonful of sugar.</font>

655
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:48,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's your darling?</font>

656
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:49,897
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

657
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Lee Dong Jin who's right beside me now.</font>

658
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:00,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Does the coffee taste good?</font>

659
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:02,997
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too sweet.</font>

660
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:06,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Sweet things make you feel better.</font>

661
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,727
<font color=#FFFF00>This'll help you come back to being my husband who has a heart...</font>

662
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,597
<font color=#FFFF00>that's as broad as the sky and as deep as the ocean,</font>

663
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:11,997
<font color=#FFFF00>so please drink all of it.</font>

664
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:14,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Who says that my heart is like the sky and ocean?</font>

665
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not that broad-minded.</font>

666
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:19,497
<font color=#FFFF00>You are. My husband is...</font>

667
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:22,797
<font color=#FFFF00>very a broad-minded and understanding person.</font>

668
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:27,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm an extremely narrow-minded and jealous person.</font>

669
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been just putting on a show to impress you.</font>

670
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you see how I'm all mad at you now?</font>

671
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:33,097
<font color=#FFFF00>This is how I really am.</font>

672
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:37,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I just thought that you have...</font>

673
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:39,397
<font color=#FFFF00>forgiven me because you had...</font>

674
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:43,297
<font color=#FFFF00>the toast and coffee and you're talking to me like this now.</font>

675
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:45,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still mad at me?</font>

676
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:48,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not that easy.</font>

677
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:53,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. Please go easy on me.</font>

678
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm always easy with you, you know.</font>

679
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:57,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

680
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,597
<font color=#FFFF00>You think you're easy?</font>

681
00:42:02,097 --> 00:42:05,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you never listen to me and you're so bullheaded.</font>

682
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:06,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

683
00:42:07,097 --> 00:42:09,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi Pyo's mum also collapsed yesterday,</font>

684
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,027
<font color=#FFFF00>so I had no choice.</font>

685
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,097
<font color=#FFFF00>I do understand,</font>

686
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,197
<font color=#FFFF00>but don't do that again.</font>

687
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I won't visit Gi Pyo...</font>

688
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,627
<font color=#FFFF00>without your permission.</font>

689
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:25,097
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I won't even bring up his name.</font>

690
00:42:25,227 --> 00:42:26,297
<font color=#FFFF00>You're sure, right?</font>

691
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought about it all night,</font>

692
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:30,297
<font color=#FFFF00>and I think it's the right thing to do.</font>

693
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:32,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Here, promise me.</font>

694
00:42:36,027 --> 00:42:37,827
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, we made a pinky promise.</font>

695
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:39,827
<font color=#FFFF00>We're even swearing on our rings.</font>

696
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:43,297
<font color=#FFFF00>If you break this promise,</font>

697
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:45,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be so grumpy.</font>

698
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:46,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to be extremely difficult.</font>

699
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,457
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

700
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:51,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Good.</font>

701
00:42:57,227 --> 00:42:58,297
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so sweet.</font>

702
00:42:58,927 --> 00:43:01,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to have a meal with you.</font>

703
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:03,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sad that you have to move away so suddenly like this.</font>

704
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:06,597
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother-in-law's health is deteriorating, so I have no choice.</font>

705
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:09,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel bad that you have to go through this.</font>

706
00:43:12,227 --> 00:43:13,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, say something.</font>

707
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Seung Woo. You're a strong boy,</font>

708
00:43:21,497 --> 00:43:23,157
<font color=#FFFF00>so you have to be good to your mum and grandma, okay?</font>

709
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:24,457
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Come here.</font>

710
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:32,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to be generous.</font>

711
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:35,297
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to say goodbye to your first love.</font>

712
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:37,427
<font color=#FFFF00>You should give her a big hug as a farewell.</font>

713
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,757
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about now?</font>

714
00:43:39,857 --> 00:43:41,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Just do it when I'm giving you a chance.</font>

715
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:43,497
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll regret it later otherwise.</font>

716
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for everything, Sam Do.</font>

717
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:06,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Feel free to call us whenever you feel down or stressed out.</font>

718
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:09,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't forget that both Sam Do and I are always on your side.</font>

719
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:11,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Sun Nyeo.</font>

720
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:15,057
<font color=#FFFF00>The taxi is here.</font>

721
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:17,197
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll get going first. - Sure.</font>

722
00:44:18,027 --> 00:44:19,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Bye. - Seung Woo, say goodbye.</font>

723
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:22,957
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodbye. - All right, have a safe journey.</font>

724
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,397
<font color=#FFFF00>- I should get going now. - All right.</font>

725
00:44:55,857 --> 00:44:57,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You can cry if you want to.</font>

726
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:00,497
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

727
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:02,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel bad for her.</font>

728
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:05,157
<font color=#FFFF00>She's still young, but she lost her husband,</font>

729
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:07,527
<font color=#FFFF00>and she now has to look after her ill mother-in-law.</font>

730
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:09,527
<font color=#FFFF00>She lost her parents at an early age...</font>

731
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:12,427
<font color=#FFFF00>and went through so much while growing up as an orphan.</font>

732
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:15,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought she could finally be happy with her husband, but...</font>

733
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:19,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I feel so bad for her.</font>

734
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,927
<font color=#FFFF00>You're probably the only man in the entire Korea who cries...</font>

735
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:29,197
<font color=#FFFF00>in front of his wife because he feels bad about his first love.</font>

736
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:33,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Be grateful that you have such an understanding wife. Come here.</font>

737
00:45:42,227 --> 00:45:44,097
<font color=#FFFF00>(Sung Tae Pyung)</font>

738
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:50,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome to WN Entertainment.</font>

739
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:52,757
<font color=#FFFF00>You're our family now.</font>

740
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:56,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for allowing me to work under such favourable conditions.</font>

741
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:59,757
<font color=#FFFF00>We'd love to meet the CEO and thank him in person.</font>

742
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:02,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Our CEO is abroad at the moment due to a business trip.</font>

743
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:04,797
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll definitely arrange something soon.</font>

744
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:05,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

745
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,597
<font color=#FFFF00>- Shall we go now? - Shall we?</font>

746
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:23,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye.</font>

747
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:26,327
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd love to take you both out for soju when you're available.</font>

748
00:46:26,357 --> 00:46:27,397
<font color=#FFFF00>That sounds good.</font>

749
00:46:28,457 --> 00:46:29,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Please go ahead.</font>

750
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:34,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you giving me this?</font>

751
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:36,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I drive?</font>

752
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,397
<font color=#FFFF00>This is your car, Tae Pyung.</font>

753
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:40,427
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me? - Excuse me?</font>

754
00:46:41,127 --> 00:46:42,227
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my car?</font>

755
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:44,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. This is your car.</font>

756
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:47,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't it in the contract? We said we'd provide you a car.</font>

757
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:51,327
<font color=#FFFF00>That didn't mean only on days when I have a schedule?</font>

758
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:53,327
<font color=#FFFF00>We told you.</font>

759
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:57,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Our CEO makes sure that his artists can work in the best environment.</font>

760
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,357
<font color=#FFFF00>He is the type that gives full support to his artists.</font>

761
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:02,757
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, he's doing so much for us.</font>

762
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:04,797
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't know how we should react to this.</font>

763
00:47:17,957 --> 00:47:20,457
<font color=#FFFF00>This credit card has been suspended.</font>

764
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:24,097
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean suspended? That can't be possible.</font>

765
00:47:24,457 --> 00:47:26,857
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please try it again. - All right.</font>

766
00:47:30,527 --> 00:47:32,127
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not working.</font>

767
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,357
<font color=#FFFF00>One moment, please.</font>

768
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

769
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. Did you have my credit card suspended?</font>

770
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,597
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - How could you do that?</font>

771
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:51,397
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do that without telling me?</font>

772
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:54,527
<font color=#FFFF00>When you run away, that means you would cut off relations with me.</font>

773
00:47:55,057 --> 00:47:57,457
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why would you use my money? - You're being so mean.</font>

774
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,057
<font color=#FFFF00>If you choose to act out like that, I'm going to do just the same.</font>

775
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:01,697
<font color=#FFFF00>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</font>

776
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:03,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I understand you.</font>

777
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:07,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, exactly one hour from now,</font>

778
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:10,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be taking away your car.</font>

779
00:48:10,197 --> 00:48:12,397
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going to take my car, too? - Of course.</font>

780
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:15,997
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, I would even like to take all your clothes,</font>

781
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:17,427
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm stopping myself.</font>

782
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum!</font>

783
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:19,857
<font color=#FFFF00>What!</font>

784
00:48:22,227 --> 00:48:23,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won. What's wrong?</font>

785
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:25,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

786
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:29,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum had my credit card suspended.</font>

787
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:31,997
<font color=#FFFF00>She says she's also going to take away my car, too.</font>

788
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:35,227
<font color=#FFFF00>So stop acting stubborn and go back home.</font>

789
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:37,727
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm going to prove to Mum...</font>

790
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:40,297
<font color=#FFFF00>that I can do well on my own without her help.</font>

791
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:43,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. This war between mother and daughter is incredible.</font>

792
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:48,057
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, did you do well on your second exam?</font>

793
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:49,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

794
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Fortunately, it was a question I knew. I think I answered well.</font>

795
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:56,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Then does this mean you'll become a teacher soon?</font>

796
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:58,727
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too early to count the chickens before they're hatched.</font>

797
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,197
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll have wait and see.</font>

798
00:49:04,827 --> 00:49:06,057
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay for these.</font>

799
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:10,397
<font color=#FFFF00>She's taken my credit card and now my car.</font>

800
00:49:11,727 --> 00:49:13,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm penniless now.</font>

801
00:49:23,897 --> 00:49:26,057
<font color=#FFFF00>(CEO Min Hyo Sang)</font>

802
00:49:26,057 --> 00:49:27,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

803
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:33,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- There's been a problem. - What is it this time?</font>

804
00:49:33,757 --> 00:49:37,557
<font color=#FFFF00>The partners of our shopping complex have stopped all investments.</font>

805
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:39,357
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

806
00:49:39,357 --> 00:49:41,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll know the details when the documents arrive.</font>

807
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:43,527
<font color=#FFFF00>They must have found out that you bet all your money...</font>

808
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:46,197
<font color=#FFFF00>as security to extend time for the loan repayment.</font>

809
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:48,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I think they have doubts on proceeding the project.</font>

810
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:50,727
<font color=#FFFF00>That deal can be closed...</font>

811
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:53,097
<font color=#FFFF00>as soon as we sell property.</font>

812
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:56,227
<font color=#FFFF00>How did they know? That's classified information between the bank and us.</font>

813
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,757
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know, Sir.</font>

814
00:49:57,757 --> 00:49:59,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Then go call the bank and find out.</font>

815
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Bring me the documents as soon as they get here.</font>

816
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:01,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Sir.</font>

817
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:07,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, it's like one obstacle after another.</font>

818
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:10,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is this all happening to me?</font>

819
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:15,797
<font color=#FFFF00>The consortium partners have suspended all investments?</font>

820
00:50:16,497 --> 00:50:17,697
<font color=#FFFF00>What about the subcontractors?</font>

821
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:19,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Since Meesa Apparel is managing the business,</font>

822
00:50:19,657 --> 00:50:22,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard they're all heading to Meesa to demand construction costs.</font>

823
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:23,827
<font color=#FFFF00>That's good news.</font>

824
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:26,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me know as soon as you get updates.</font>

825
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:35,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just say you had a bad dream.</font>

826
00:50:36,457 --> 00:50:39,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Just get over it and wake up, Gi Pyo.</font>

827
00:50:40,527 --> 00:50:44,457
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so worried about you. You're breaking my heart.</font>

828
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:51,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh goodness. Who is this?</font>

829
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:53,057
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here, Board President?</font>

830
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:55,897
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be very worried.</font>

831
00:50:55,897 --> 00:50:58,427
<font color=#FFFF00>It's beyond words how worried I am.</font>

832
00:50:58,427 --> 00:51:02,357
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't tell you how worried I am.</font>

833
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:03,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't imagine.</font>

834
00:51:03,597 --> 00:51:07,457
<font color=#FFFF00>How unfair he must have thought?</font>

835
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:10,557
<font color=#FFFF00>I get so upset whenever I think about it.</font>

836
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:12,397
<font color=#FFFF00>How about your daughter-in-law?</font>

837
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:16,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she while you're here looking after your son?</font>

838
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:18,557
<font color=#FFFF00>She was here last night,</font>

839
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:21,697
<font color=#FFFF00>but she left as soon as the sun came up.</font>

840
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:23,827
<font color=#FFFF00>But your daughter-in-law must look after him.</font>

841
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:25,697
<font color=#FFFF00>He can't express it,</font>

842
00:51:26,297 --> 00:51:30,027
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm sure he's waiting for her even if he's unconscious.</font>

843
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:32,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think so, too?</font>

844
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:38,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Everything looks reasonable.</font>

845
00:51:38,797 --> 00:51:40,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad you're satisfied with the contract.</font>

846
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:44,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me know if there're any modifications you'd like to make...</font>

847
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:46,297
<font color=#FFFF00>before we finalise the contract.</font>

848
00:51:46,297 --> 00:51:49,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Let's sign the final contract next week.</font>

849
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:52,757
<font color=#FFFF00>And also, I drew up the press releases myself.</font>

850
00:51:52,757 --> 00:51:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>That's great. Please also send me the Korean translations...</font>

851
00:51:56,827 --> 00:52:00,397
<font color=#FFFF00>so I can confirm that it properly defines Tonelli's position as well.</font>

852
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:02,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I will. Thank you, Gianni.</font>

853
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:05,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin. No, CEO Lee.</font>

854
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,527
<font color=#FFFF00>- The talk went well, right? - Yes, of course.</font>

855
00:52:07,527 --> 00:52:09,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm looking forward to seeing you in action, Mr Bae.</font>

856
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:12,197
<font color=#FFFF00>What did he just say?</font>

857
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:14,497
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he has high expectations for you, Master Bae.</font>

858
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:15,497
<font color=#FFFF00>For me?</font>

859
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:17,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you crazy? No, wait.</font>

860
00:52:17,527 --> 00:52:18,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine, thank you.</font>

861
00:52:18,997 --> 00:52:21,657
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I better get going. I've got an interview to do,</font>

862
00:52:21,657 --> 00:52:23,457
<font color=#FFFF00>but let's stay in touch.</font>

863
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:24,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Let's go.</font>

864
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:28,127
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. - Goodbye.</font>

865
00:52:29,627 --> 00:52:32,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Then does this mean Wolgyesu Tailor Shop...</font>

866
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:34,627
<font color=#FFFF00>and Tonelli, the Italian company,</font>

867
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:36,297
<font color=#FFFF00>will be making suits together?</font>

868
00:52:36,297 --> 00:52:38,327
<font color=#FFFF00>I think that's what's going to happen.</font>

869
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:41,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Our CEO is truly amazing.</font>

870
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:43,327
<font color=#FFFF00>His business acumen is unbelievable.</font>

871
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree. I think I met...</font>

872
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:47,627
<font color=#FFFF00>the perfect husband.</font>

873
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:49,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you just see her?</font>

874
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought Dong Jin was the fool,</font>

875
00:52:52,997 --> 00:52:54,127
<font color=#FFFF00>but now that I see it, so is Yun Shil.</font>

876
00:53:01,227 --> 00:53:03,727
<font color=#FFFF00>It might be because this car's so nice,</font>

877
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:05,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I just put my foot on the accelerator and it moves smoothly.</font>

878
00:53:06,597 --> 00:53:08,727
<font color=#FFFF00>About the CEO...</font>

879
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:12,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder how wealthy he his to be supporting you like this.</font>

880
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:14,027
<font color=#FFFF00>It might not be because he has a lot of money.</font>

881
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure it's because he likes my music.</font>

882
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:19,927
<font color=#FFFF00>We musicians have such thing as pure passion.</font>

883
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:29,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I see Dad over there.</font>

884
00:53:30,097 --> 00:53:31,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Pull over, Sung Joon.</font>

885
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:33,057
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. Okay.</font>

886
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:43,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

887
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

888
00:53:45,827 --> 00:53:48,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. Dad.</font>

889
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:53,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

890
00:53:55,057 --> 00:53:58,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder what's wrong with Dad? He ignored me.</font>

891
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:01,297
<font color=#FFFF00>- Maybe he didn't see you. - I waved both hands.</font>

892
00:54:01,657 --> 00:54:03,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe he didn't notice because he was lost in his thoughts.</font>

893
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:09,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

894
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:11,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

895
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:16,497
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

896
00:54:16,497 --> 00:54:19,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook and I were going for a drive when we noticed you.</font>

897
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:22,957
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you just go without noticing your daughter?</font>

898
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:26,057
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I must have been thinking about something.</font>

899
00:54:26,057 --> 00:54:28,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung signed a contract with an agency today.</font>

900
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,127
<font color=#FFFF00>They gave us a car to use for free.</font>

901
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that right?</font>

902
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:35,597
<font color=#FFFF00>We were just driving. Why don't you join us, Dad?</font>

903
00:54:35,597 --> 00:54:37,227
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Sounds great.</font>

904
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:38,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

905
00:54:38,297 --> 00:54:39,727
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go, Dad. - Okay.</font>

906
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:51,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

907
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this Bok Sun Nyeo speaking?</font>

908
00:54:53,597 --> 00:54:55,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. This is she speaking.</font>

909
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:58,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you apply for our job opening?</font>

910
00:54:58,197 --> 00:54:59,997
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Congratulations.</font>

911
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,227
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been hired for the position.</font>

912
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, dear. - Please come tomorrow.</font>

913
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:06,297
<font color=#FFFF00>- Training will start from tomorrow. - Oh, gosh.</font>

914
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:09,657
<font color=#FFFF00>I got the job? Thank you.</font>

915
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:11,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Yes. Thank you.</font>

916
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:14,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my goodness.</font>

917
00:55:17,497 --> 00:55:19,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Talks went so well with Tonelli.</font>

918
00:55:19,657 --> 00:55:23,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't we call it a day and go for a drink on a day like this?</font>

919
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:26,527
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all on me today.</font>

920
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,097
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to apologise for worrying everyone so much.</font>

921
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:31,597
<font color=#FFFF00>How could we...</font>

922
00:55:31,597 --> 00:55:33,057
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Then you pay for the first round.</font>

923
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:34,657
<font color=#FFFF00>The groom can pay for the second round.</font>

924
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:38,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Before we head for drinks and food, let me treat you all to tea.</font>

925
00:55:40,827 --> 00:55:43,227
<font color=#FFFF00>How about we go to the new pork restaurant near the junction?</font>

926
00:55:43,227 --> 00:55:44,657
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - That sounds good.</font>

927
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:46,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You sure do like pork belly, don't you?</font>

928
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:50,227
<font color=#FFFF00>(Gi Pyo's Mother)</font>

929
00:55:52,397 --> 00:55:53,527
<font color=#FFFF00>(Gi Pyo's Mother)</font>

930
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:58,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you even worried about Gi Pyo?</font>

931
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:00,997
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you leave like that and not even call?</font>

932
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:02,657
<font color=#FFFF00>If you have anything to say, say it to me.</font>

933
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:03,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is this?</font>

934
00:56:04,697 --> 00:56:06,327
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the CEO of the tailor shop, aren't you?</font>

935
00:56:06,427 --> 00:56:08,657
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys couldn't wait to be together, could you?</font>

936
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,397
<font color=#FFFF00>If you have nothing else to say, I'm hanging up.</font>

937
00:56:10,597 --> 00:56:11,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

938
00:56:12,157 --> 00:56:14,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell Yun Shil that Gi Pyo...</font>

939
00:56:14,597 --> 00:56:17,397
<font color=#FFFF00>has been moved from the intensive care unit to the general ward.</font>

940
00:56:17,397 --> 00:56:19,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that mean his condition has gotten better?</font>

941
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:20,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

942
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:23,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you hoping he remains in the intensive care unit?</font>

943
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,727
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a relief to hear that he's better.</font>

944
00:56:25,857 --> 00:56:27,557
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pass the word on to Yun Shil.</font>

945
00:56:27,557 --> 00:56:28,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait a minute!</font>

946
00:56:29,227 --> 00:56:31,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I have an urgent business in Anseong,</font>

947
00:56:31,297 --> 00:56:32,657
<font color=#FFFF00>so I have to go there now.</font>

948
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:35,927
<font color=#FFFF00>If Yun Shil comes, tell her to stay in the ward.</font>

949
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:38,127
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm asking her since I'm in such a hurry.</font>

950
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:39,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell her to come right away.</font>

951
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:45,657
<font color=#FFFF00>(Peace Gosiwon)</font>

952
00:56:45,657 --> 00:56:46,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

953
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,057
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Give me the key.</font>

954
00:57:01,157 --> 00:57:02,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really have to do this?</font>

955
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:06,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You left home since you didn't like me.</font>

956
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:09,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to give you my credit card and car.</font>

957
00:57:10,657 --> 00:57:12,657
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll give you since you're being cheap.</font>

958
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:20,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Kim, what are you doing?</font>

959
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:31,657
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

960
00:57:32,757 --> 00:57:35,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you ask? Of course these are your clothes and bags.</font>

961
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you bring it here?</font>

962
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:39,797
<font color=#FFFF00>When you run out of money,</font>

963
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:41,827
<font color=#FFFF00>sell these and use the money.</font>

964
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum!</font>

965
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:47,627
<font color=#FFFF00>You're ignorant of the world. You should have a hard time...</font>

966
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:49,397
<font color=#FFFF00>and then you would appreciate your mum.</font>

967
00:57:51,997 --> 00:57:55,297
<font color=#FFFF00>You would realise soon...</font>

968
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:56,497
<font color=#FFFF00>what a good daughter I was.</font>

969
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:05,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Kim,</font>

970
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:07,327
<font color=#FFFF00>- let's go. - Yes, Madam Ko.</font>

971
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,697
<font color=#FFFF00>(Peace Gosiwon)</font>

972
00:58:28,357 --> 00:58:29,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye, Sally.</font>

973
00:58:31,227 --> 00:58:34,597
<font color=#FFFF00>You take advantage of subcontractors, Min Hyo Sang!</font>

974
00:58:34,697 --> 00:58:37,927
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should apologise! - You should apologise!</font>

975
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Min Hyo Sang should apologise!</font>

00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,157
<font color=#FFFF00>You take advantage of subcontractors, Min Hyo Sang!</font>

979
00:58:46,157 --> 00:58:48,457
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should apologise! - You should apologise!</font>

980
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:50,827
<font color=#FFFF00>What are they doing in front of my house?</font>

981
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,527
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should apologise! - You should apologise!</font>

985
00:58:59,357 --> 00:59:00,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

986
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:03,827
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

987
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:05,427
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't get the construction payment...</font>

988
00:59:05,427 --> 00:59:06,897
<font color=#FFFF00>due to the rumour of bankruptcy.</font>

989
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:08,597
<font color=#FFFF00>We came here to get the money from Min Hyo Sang.</font>

990
00:59:08,597 --> 00:59:09,597
<font color=#FFFF00>A bankruptcy?</font>

991
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:13,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who's going bankrupt? - It's Meesa Apparel, of course.</font>

992
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:15,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's telling you such a nonsense?</font>

993
00:59:16,027 --> 00:59:18,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Our Meesa Apparel would never go bankrupt!</font>

994
00:59:18,857 --> 00:59:19,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Our Meesa Apparel?</font>

995
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:22,097
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you related to Min Hyo Sang?</font>

996
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:24,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you saying my son's name thoughtlessly?</font>

997
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:27,857
<font color=#FFFF00>She must be Min Hyo Sang's mum.</font>

998
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell you son...</font>

999
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,797
<font color=#FFFF00>to pay for the delayed construction payment.</font>

1000
00:59:33,397 --> 00:59:35,227
<font color=#FFFF00>A vicious enterpriser Min Hyo Sang should...</font>

1001
00:59:35,227 --> 00:59:38,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- pay for the construction! - Pay for the construction!</font>

1002
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:41,797
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pay for the construction! - Pay for the construction!</font>

1003
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:45,227
<font color=#FFFF00>It is deafening.</font>

1004
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:48,157
<font color=#FFFF00>What are they doing?</font>

1005
00:59:49,697 --> 00:59:50,927
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

1006
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:52,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother!</font>

1007
00:59:55,597 --> 00:59:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Yun.</font>

1008
00:59:56,757 --> 00:59:59,497
<font color=#FFFF00>She must be Min Hyo Sang's wife.</font>

1009
00:59:59,497 --> 01:00:01,357
<font color=#FFFF00>A vicious enterpriser Min Hyo Sang should...</font>

1010

<font color=#FFFF00>- pay for the construction! - Pay for the construction!</font>

1011

1012
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:09,557
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pay for the construction! - Pay for the construction!</font>

1013
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:11,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are all these people?</font>

1014
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea...</font>

1015
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:14,597
<font color=#FFFF00>what's going on.</font>

1016
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:17,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pay for the construction! - Pay for the construction!</font>

1017
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:24,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I have a matter to take care of.</font>

1018
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:27,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's have a nice get-together later.</font>

1019
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,127
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Let's go home early today.</font>

1020
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:31,327
<font color=#FFFF00>See you tomorrow.</font>

1021
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:32,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

1022
01:00:35,597 --> 01:00:38,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still angry at me?</font>

1023
01:00:39,597 --> 01:00:41,927
<font color=#FFFF00>You talked about a get-together nicely before.</font>

1024
01:00:42,227 --> 01:00:45,827
<font color=#FFFF00>And then you suddenly cancel it and don't even look at me.</font>

1025
01:00:47,157 --> 01:00:50,057
<font color=#FFFF00>You thought that you forgot your anger so early.</font>

1026
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:51,797
<font color=#FFFF00>So you're being angry again, right?</font>

1027
01:00:52,227 --> 01:00:55,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you treating a sane man as if he were moody?</font>

1028
01:00:55,897 --> 01:00:58,757
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not nothing like that, so you can go home first.</font>

1029
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,927
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you sure? - Trust me.</font>

1030
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:04,897
<font color=#FFFF00>A friend asked to meet him...</font>

1031
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:07,527
<font color=#FFFF00>since he got an urgent matter. Don't worry.</font>

1032
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:09,697
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, then.</font>

1033
01:01:09,997 --> 01:01:11,557
<font color=#FFFF00>See you later at home.</font>

1034
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:43,157
<font color=#FFFF00>(Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

1035
01:01:48,627 --> 01:01:49,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm home.</font>

1036
01:01:51,057 --> 01:01:53,227
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where's Dong Jin? - He has an urgent matter.</font>

1037
01:01:53,227 --> 01:01:54,457
<font color=#FFFF00>So I came home first.</font>

1038
01:01:56,097 --> 01:01:59,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Promise me you won't go near to the hospital.</font>

1039
01:01:59,827 --> 01:02:00,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mother.</font>

1040
01:02:01,997 --> 01:02:04,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Go inside and have dinner. You must be hungry.</font>

1041
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:19,357
<font color=#FFFF00>(Saemaeum Hospital)</font>

1042
01:02:44,297 --> 01:02:45,827
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can remove his respirator. - Yes.</font>

1043
01:02:48,027 --> 01:02:49,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard he got better.</font>

1044
01:02:50,127 --> 01:02:51,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't he wake up yet?</font>

1045
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:53,797
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not serious,</font>

1046
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,427
<font color=#FFFF00>but his bleeding from head made him less immune...</font>

1047
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:59,957
<font color=#FFFF00>and breathe unstably. That's why he couldn't wake up.</font>

1048
01:02:59,957 --> 01:03:02,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that his breathing is stable,</font>

1049
01:03:02,497 --> 01:03:03,797
<font color=#FFFF00>he would wake up soon.</font>

1050
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:07,897
<font color=#FFFF00>The operation result for his enterorrhexis is also good.</font>

1051
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:11,427
<font color=#FFFF00>He had his kidney donated before.</font>

1052
01:03:11,597 --> 01:03:13,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Wouldn't he have a problem...</font>

1053
01:03:13,897 --> 01:03:15,057
<font color=#FFFF00>for his injury this time?</font>

1054
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:16,927
<font color=#FFFF00>He had his kidney donated?</font>

1055
01:03:18,557 --> 01:03:19,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think so.</font>

1056
01:03:20,127 --> 01:03:21,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you hold this?</font>

1057
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:27,457
<font color=#FFFF00>If he was a kidney donor,</font>

1058
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:30,857
<font color=#FFFF00>he should have a wound around here.</font>

1059
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:32,757
<font color=#FFFF00>When I saw his body before the operation,</font>

1060
01:03:32,957 --> 01:03:34,427
<font color=#FFFF00>he didn't have any surgical scar.</font>

1061
01:03:34,927 --> 01:03:37,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you run a test on his kidney?</font>

1062
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:39,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I had a CT scan all over.</font>

1063
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:42,227
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I see it? - Are you his guardian?</font>

1064
01:03:44,057 --> 01:03:45,927
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, I am. - Follow me.</font>

1065
01:04:02,857 --> 01:04:05,357
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the kidney.</font>

1066
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:07,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you see? Both kidney are...</font>

1067
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:09,527
<font color=#FFFF00>in the right place.</font>

1068
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:13,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure it's Hong Gi Pyo's picture?</font>

1069
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:15,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, this patient...</font>

1070
01:04:16,097 --> 01:04:17,657
<font color=#FFFF00>hadn't donated his kidney...</font>

1071
01:04:17,757 --> 01:04:21,097
<font color=#FFFF00>and hadn't had any surgery related to the kidney either.</font>

1072
01:04:57,657 --> 01:04:58,727
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

1073
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:01,757
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why are you here? - I appreciate...</font>

1074
01:05:02,827 --> 01:05:04,127
<font color=#FFFF00>that you woke up on time.</font>

1075
01:05:10,097 --> 01:05:11,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Yun Shil?</font>

1076
01:05:12,227 --> 01:05:14,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil! Na Yun Shil!</font>

1077
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:16,797
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you look for Yun Shil?</font>

1078
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:20,557
<font color=#FFFF00>You have deceived her all along.</font>

1079
01:05:21,227 --> 01:05:22,327
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1080
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:24,357
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

1081
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:27,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been emphasising your favour all along...</font>

1082
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:29,827
<font color=#FFFF00>that you had your kidney donated to Yun Shil's dad.</font>

1083
01:05:30,457 --> 01:05:31,527
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

1084
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:33,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think that would work now.</font>

1085
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:36,427
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

1086
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:40,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I just checked on your CT pictures.</font>

1087
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:44,597
<font color=#FFFF00>You have two kidneys right inside you.</font>

1088
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:46,457
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have any surgical scar on your stomach.</font>

1089
01:05:47,227 --> 01:05:48,357
<font color=#FFFF00>You are...</font>

1090
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:53,297
<font color=#FFFF00>a small-time crook.</font>

1091
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:55,927
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1092
01:06:12,827 --> 01:06:14,327
<font color=#FFFF00>(We thank Choi Ji Na for her special appearance.)</font>

1093
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,357
<font color=#FFFF00>(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)</font>

1094
01:06:36,757 --> 01:06:38,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin. How did you know that?</font>

1095
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,997
<font color=#FFFF00>How could she be fooled by a guy like that for over 10 years?</font>

1096
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,457
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't tell Yun Shil already, did you?</font>

1097
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,497
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not that.</font>

1098
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:44,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- Darn it. - Gosh, those love birds.</font>

1099
01:06:44,897 --> 01:06:47,957
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go ahead and live happily and be love birds like us then.</font>

1100
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:49,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Go buy some eel. Ones that were freshly caught from the sea.</font>

1101
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:51,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't you need a part-timer? - You're going to work?</font>

1102
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:54,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave things as they are? Nothing works out easily for you two.</font>

1103
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:57,557
<font color=#FFFF00>You ruined Yun Shil's life with your dirty lies.</font>

1104
01:06:57,557 --> 01:06:59,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if Yun Shil finds out, nothing will change.</font>

1105
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:00,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil's my woman.</font>
