00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,076
<font color="yellow">It's time to wake up, honey.</font>

5
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:23,606
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to wake up. - You don't want?</font>

6
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,706
<font color="yellow">Then shall we just go back to sleep?</font>

7
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,346
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

8
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,216
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

9
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,706
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Do you like our new room?</font>

10
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:43,106
<font color="yellow">Yes. I love it.</font>

11
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:45,176
<font color="yellow">I love the room...</font>

12
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,606
<font color="yellow">and my husband.</font>

13
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:50,506
<font color="yellow">Your becoming more aggressive in expressing your affection now.</font>

14
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:52,876
<font color="yellow">You're doing well, Ms Shiny Eyes.</font>

15
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,206
<font color="yellow">- I learned it from Mr Pretty Eyes. - Right?</font>

16
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:04,176
<font color="yellow">That hurts!</font>

17
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,206
<font color="yellow">This model is popular among newly married couples.</font>

18
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:13,076
<font color="yellow">What do you two think after lying on it?</font>

19
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:19,106
<font color="yellow">I like it. How about you?</font>

20
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:21,406
<font color="yellow">If the bride likes it, we should get it indeed.</font>

21
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:23,746
<font color="yellow">- We'll take this. - Then please follow me...</font>

22
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:24,876
<font color="yellow">so I can help you fill out an order sheet.</font>

23
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,946
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

24
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:29,076
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

25
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,506
<font color="yellow">Now that we've ordered the bed...</font>

26
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:39,746
<font color="yellow">let's go look at wedding rings next.</font>

27
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:42,376
<font color="yellow">We don't need wedding rings.</font>

28
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,746
<font color="yellow">This is more than enough for me.</font>

29
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:48,906
<font color="yellow">That's our couple ring. A wedding ring should be a diamond.</font>

30
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:50,776
<font color="yellow">I don't need a diamond ring.</font>

31
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:52,976
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it some day.</font>

32
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:56,606
<font color="yellow">You're more valuable to me than a diamond.</font>

33
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:58,176
<font color="yellow">We don't need to waste money, okay?</font>

34
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,806
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

35
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:08,906
<font color="yellow">If you say something that sweet,</font>

36
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:10,976
<font color="yellow">how can I not hug you like this?</font>

37
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,816
<font color="yellow">- People are looking at us. - It's okay. Stay still.</font>

38
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:18,506
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that I'm more valuable than a jewel.</font>

39
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,816
<font color="yellow">Now I see why men say that there's no one like their wife.</font>

40
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,606
<font color="yellow">Then we'll skip the ring.</font>

41
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:28,816
<font color="yellow">Now let's go to a travel agency.</font>

42
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:30,506
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a hot spring...</font>

43
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:33,246
<font color="yellow">with your parents for our honeymoon.</font>

44
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:34,776
<font color="yellow">We're not living in the 1970s.</font>

45
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:37,106
<font color="yellow">Who goes to a hot spring on their honeymoon?</font>

46
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:38,946
<font color="yellow">Would it be weird?</font>

47
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,816
<font color="yellow">Then how about Jeju Island or Gangwon Province?</font>

48
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:45,076
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Ms Choi and Mr Lee would be happy.</font>

49
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,306
<font color="yellow">The bride should go where she wants to go.</font>

50
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:49,376
<font color="yellow">A honeymoon is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.</font>

51
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,976
<font color="yellow">I can go anywhere if it's with you.</font>

52
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:55,046
<font color="yellow">I think Ms Shiny Eyes is in big trouble.</font>

53
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:57,446
<font color="yellow">You're so fascinated by me that you've lost your senses.</font>

54
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:59,676
<font color="yellow">Your world is filled with me.</font>

55
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,046
<font color="yellow">Why does that mean I'm in trouble?</font>

56
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:05,046
<font color="yellow">I know your world is filled with me, too.</font>

57
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:06,606
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

58
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,446
<font color="yellow">Then what about our wedding shoot?</font>

59
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,806
<font color="yellow">We did that already. Why do it again?</font>

60
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,076
<font color="yellow">If you say no to everything everyone does,</font>

61
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,106
<font color="yellow">then what on earth do we have left to prepare?</font>

62
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,606
<font color="yellow">We have each other...</font>

63
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:21,676
<font color="yellow">and we have family members who give us their blessings.</font>

64
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,376
<font color="yellow">What more can we ask for?</font>

65
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:27,306
<font color="yellow">I just want a quiet and simple wedding.</font>

66
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,876
<font color="yellow">You're so sweet and kind.</font>

67
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:37,776
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

68
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,106
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

69
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:43,406
<font color="yellow">I was just a bit startled because I stumbled.</font>

70
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:46,976
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Are you hurt?</font>

71
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,646
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay. Let's go.</font>

72
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,276
<font color="yellow">- Did you enjoy your honeymoon? - Yes.</font>

73
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,206
<font color="yellow">Madam Ko.</font>

74
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:09,546
<font color="yellow">We've returned safely from our honeymoon, Mother.</font>

75
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:12,146
<font color="yellow">Welcome back. Did you enjoy the trip?</font>

76
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:13,706
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother.</font>

77
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,046
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Won.</font>

78
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:20,406
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

79
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:23,776
<font color="yellow">Your brother and sister-in-law have returned from their trip.</font>

80
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:24,946
<font color="yellow">You're not going to greet them?</font>

81
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:29,246
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

82
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,076
<font color="yellow">It's been awhile.</font>

83
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:32,546
<font color="yellow">I've missed you.</font>

84
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:36,646
<font color="yellow">Mother, we'll go and change clothes and come make our deep bows.</font>

85
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,506
<font color="yellow">I don't need your deep bows.</font>

86
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,576
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun said it's a custom to bow deeply...</font>

87
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,616
<font color="yellow">to the elders in the family...</font>

88
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:46,346
<font color="yellow">to show that we've become adults after getting married.</font>

89
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,446
<font color="yellow">We'll be right back.</font>

90
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,046
<font color="yellow">Mum,</font>

91
00:04:57,706 --> 00:04:58,706
<font color="yellow">I want to move out.</font>

92
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:02,646
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - I can't stand living under...</font>

93
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:03,976
<font color="yellow">the same roof as pooper.</font>

94
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,116
<font color="yellow">How dare you call your sister-in-law pooper?</font>

95
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,276
<font color="yellow">You two got along fine until not long ago.</font>

96
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,076
<font color="yellow">Why do you hate her so much all of a sudden?</font>

97
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:15,506
<font color="yellow">The fact that she is two-faced...</font>

98
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,616
<font color="yellow">gets on my nerves.</font>

99
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:21,446
<font color="yellow">You're already starting to act like a wicked sister-in-law.</font>

100
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,506
<font color="yellow">That's not right!</font>

101
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:27,946
<font color="yellow">What's with the hanbok?</font>

102
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:30,176
<font color="yellow">Mum, please receive our bows.</font>

103
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:36,446
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

104
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:39,446
<font color="yellow">You should have been more careful.</font>

105
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,876
<font color="yellow">Your clumsier than you look.</font>

106
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:04,276
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

107
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:10,776
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? You look upset.</font>

108
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:14,846
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang and Ji Yun came back from their honeymoon.</font>

109
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,876
<font color="yellow">How can I live in the same house with them?</font>

110
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:21,606
<font color="yellow">I feel hopeless.</font>

111
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:25,206
<font color="yellow">I told Mum that I want to leave the house, but she wouldn't let me.</font>

112
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:28,606
<font color="yellow">They are your family now. Don't focus on the negative effect.</font>

113
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,846
<font color="yellow">Isn't he the model from the cosmetics commercial?</font>

114
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:33,846
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

115
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,246
<font color="yellow">- That's him. - Goodness.</font>

116
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:38,976
<font color="yellow">You look better in real.</font>

117
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,376
<font color="yellow">- You look prettier today. - You look prettier today, you said.</font>

118
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,506
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally! - Exceptionally!</font>

119
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,776
<font color="yellow">- Pretty! - Pretty!</font>

120
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:45,046
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally! - Exceptionally!</font>

121
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:47,076
<font color="yellow">Can I take a picture with you?</font>

122
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,146
<font color="yellow">I can take the picture for you.</font>

123
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,746
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - I want to take the picture, too.</font>

124
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,276
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won. - In 1, 2, 3!</font>

125
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,146
<font color="yellow">- Come quickly! - I want to take, too.</font>

126
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:08,046
<font color="yellow">- Honey! - I haven't given my autograph.</font>

127
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:09,806
<font color="yellow">- Honey! - Give me your autograph.</font>

128
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,046
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

129
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,376
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

130
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:16,746
<font color="yellow">- Honey! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

131

<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

132
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,246
<font color="yellow">- Honey! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:23,946
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

134
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:26,246
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Honey!</font>

135
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,606
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

136
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,976
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

137
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,906
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

138
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:35,706
<font color="yellow">- He looks so happy. - Exceptionally pretty.</font>

139
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,046
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

140
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:40,306
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

141
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,646
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty! - Exceptionally pretty!</font>

142
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,046
<font color="yellow">- Exceptionally pretty. - Hyo Won!</font>

143
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:46,576
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? - Wait.</font>

144
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,806
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won, wait. - Where are you going?</font>

145
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,276
<font color="yellow">- Don't go! - Where are you going?</font>

146
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,306
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won!</font>

147
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,506
<font color="yellow">- It's a misunderstanding. - Stay here.</font>

148
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:06,846
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won. - Give me your autograph.</font>

149
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:13,276
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that Tae Yang is such kind of person.</font>

150
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,076
<font color="yellow">He was so happy to see all those high school girls.</font>

151
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,346
<font color="yellow">Does it mean that he likes young girls or what?</font>

152
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:31,716
<font color="yellow">- How are you? - Hello.</font>

153
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,576
<font color="yellow">I heard that you went to see the furniture. How was it?</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't you dare look at other girls.</font>

305
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,806
<font color="yellow">Fix your eyes on me.</font>

306
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,046
<font color="yellow">You're so greedy.</font>

307
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,576
<font color="yellow">I wonder what all that greed is for?</font>

308
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:33,746
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

309
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:40,546
<font color="yellow">It's me, Man Sool.</font>

310
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,246
<font color="yellow">Did you receive the document...</font>

311
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,946
<font color="yellow">from Wolgyesu Tailor Shop?</font>

312
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:46,806
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

313
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:49,506
<font color="yellow">I've heard Dong Jin's plan...</font>

314
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:52,606
<font color="yellow">and I've agreed to it. So read through it carefully.</font>

315
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:56,806
<font color="yellow">It's time for tailors to start a new method of work. Don't you think so?</font>

316
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:59,206
<font color="yellow">It's not because it's my son's idea.</font>

317
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:03,546
<font color="yellow">I believe it will open new doors to tailors.</font>

318
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,206
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

319
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,046
<font color="yellow">Let's meet soon.</font>

320
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:12,146
<font color="yellow">My husband, Man Sool,</font>

321
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,206
<font color="yellow">looks excited for a change.</font>

322
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:17,006
<font color="yellow">Our Dong Jin is planning...</font>

323
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:19,976
<font color="yellow">something that no one else has thought up of before.</font>

324
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,546
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of him not just because he's my son.</font>

325
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:25,046
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin is indeed a man of great capacity.</font>

326
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,246
<font color="yellow">What is this man doing?</font>

327
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:32,276
<font color="yellow">What are you doing with your cellphone so close to your face?</font>

328
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,646
<font color="yellow">My eyes are bleary. It must be because I'm tried.</font>

329
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,506
<font color="yellow">- Should I help you? - It's okay.</font>

330
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,916
<font color="yellow">Go to the eye clinic tomorrow.</font>

331
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,306
<font color="yellow">You should have your eyesight tested again and get new glasses.</font>

332
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:45,776
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, you'll ruin your eyes.</font>

333
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:48,276
<font color="yellow">All right. I was going to go anyway.</font>

334
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:49,476
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

335
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,306
<font color="yellow">Welcome back.</font>

336
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:58,476
<font color="yellow">- Did you have dinner? - Yes, I ate out.</font>

337
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:01,676
<font color="yellow">I was in the middle of calling my fellow tailors.</font>

338
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,246
<font color="yellow">Regarding your plan,</font>

339
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,346
<font color="yellow">I think some are excited and some are worried.</font>

340
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,416
<font color="yellow">If I explain to them in detail in person,</font>

341
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,546
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they'll feel more relaxed.</font>

342
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,946
<font color="yellow">By the way, where's Yun Shil?</font>

343
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:15,476
<font color="yellow">Weren't you two at the tailor shop together?</font>

344
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:18,276
<font color="yellow">I thought she had come home first because she wasn't at the shop.</font>

345
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:21,006
<font color="yellow">She must have had some business to take care of.</font>

346
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,776
<font color="yellow">- Go get some rest. - Okay.</font>

347
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:29,646
<font color="yellow">It's me, Yun Shil. I'm coming in.</font>

348
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:33,946
<font color="yellow">What brings her here on her own?</font>

349
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,806
<font color="yellow">What brings...</font>

350
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,916
<font color="yellow">our precious Yun Shil all the way to this humble place?</font>

351
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,446
<font color="yellow">What is this? You should eat a proper meal.</font>

352
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:53,976
<font color="yellow">Did you come to make me angry?</font>

353
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:57,606
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I can't eat properly?</font>

354
00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:59,916
<font color="yellow">So go back to Anseong...</font>

355
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,376
<font color="yellow">and live in comfort.</font>

356
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:03,476
<font color="yellow">Why? Is it because you want to send me away...</font>

357
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:06,776
<font color="yellow">and get married to Dong Jin?</font>

358
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:10,006
<font color="yellow">Stop screwing around and come back to Gi Pyo...</font>

359
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,106
<font color="yellow">when I'm saying it nicely.</font>

360
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,576
<font color="yellow">The man I love is Dong Jin, not Gi Pyo.</font>

361
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:18,206
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you're talking about love to?</font>

362
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:19,376
<font color="yellow">I tried...</font>

363
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:22,416
<font color="yellow">really hard to like Gi Pyo.</font>

364
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,806
<font color="yellow">He can be tough but he's a good person.</font>

365
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:28,206
<font color="yellow">I thought I could like him eventually...</font>

366
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:31,676
<font color="yellow">if I try hard and live together.</font>

367
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:35,776
<font color="yellow">I thought we'd be able to live together somehow.</font>

368
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,806
<font color="yellow">But no matter how hard I tried, it didn't work.</font>

369
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,846
<font color="yellow">I wanted to run away from him several times a day...</font>

370
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,006
<font color="yellow">because I was scared of him.</font>

371
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:48,606
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk like that after all that he's done for you?</font>

372
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,876
<font color="yellow">You ungrateful brat!</font>

373
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,446
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to understand me.</font>

374
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,476
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you my feelings...</font>

375
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:58,346
<font color="yellow">so that you can help Gi Pyo...</font>

376
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,446
<font color="yellow">forget about a girl like me...</font>

377
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,376
<font color="yellow">and meet a better person and live happily.</font>

378
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:08,276
<font color="yellow">That's what I'd like to say.</font>

379
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,876
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I have no intention of...</font>

380
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:13,146
<font color="yellow">seeing a girl like you with no family...</font>

381
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:16,676
<font color="yellow">and who has been with another man as Gi Pyo's wife.</font>

382
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:20,346
<font color="yellow">But Gi Pyo says he can't live without you. What should I do?</font>

383
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:25,106
<font color="yellow">In order for Gi Pyo to change his mind, go back to Anseong.</font>

384
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,306
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

385
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:36,546
<font color="yellow">You're telling me to take this piece of meat and some fruits...</font>

386
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:37,706
<font color="yellow">and leave for good?</font>

387
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,106
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down on us?</font>

388
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,276
<font color="yellow">Good bye. Take care.</font>

389
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:46,906
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop there. I'm telling you to stop!</font>

390
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:50,976
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

391
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:00,176
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

392
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:04,646
<font color="yellow">Where have you been? You didn't even answer your phone.</font>

393
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,146
<font color="yellow">Did it hurt you that much?</font>

394
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:12,446
<font color="yellow">Are you upset because I left after answering my ex-wife's call?</font>

395
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:16,076
<font color="yellow">You went through much more...</font>

396
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:18,346
<font color="yellow">but still understood me and comforted me.</font>

397
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,746
<font color="yellow">How could I get upset over a small thing like that?</font>

398
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:23,706
<font color="yellow">I got worried not knowing your thoughts.</font>

399
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,076
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo was here...</font>

400
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:28,246
<font color="yellow">to ask for help because Meesa Apparel is having trouble.</font>

401
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:31,776
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to explain.</font>

402
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:35,176
<font color="yellow">If I were you, I would want to know why she was here.</font>

403
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:36,676
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you.</font>

404
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,746
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you, too.</font>

405
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,506
<font color="yellow">I received a letter from Gi Pyo.</font>

406
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:46,976
<font color="yellow">Do you mind if I ask you what it was about?</font>

407
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,476
<font color="yellow">The same as usual.</font>

408
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,846
<font color="yellow">So I'm on my way back from meeting Gi Pyo's mother.</font>

409
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:53,746
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking by going there alone?</font>

410
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,646
<font color="yellow">I went to ask...</font>

411
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:58,646
<font color="yellow">or even beg to end things,</font>

412
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:00,706
<font color="yellow">but it didn't go well.</font>

413
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,746
<font color="yellow">It's okay since you're back safely.</font>

414
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,806
<font color="yellow">Let's promise to continue being honest...</font>

415
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:14,246
<font color="yellow">without hiding anything as a married couple. Okay?</font>

416
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,276
<font color="yellow">Mum, Dad. Come out.</font>

417
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,376
<font color="yellow">Da Jeong, what is it?</font>

418
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:30,906
<font color="yellow">There's a video...</font>

419
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:32,846
<font color="yellow">of you singing on the bus posted on the Internet.</font>

420
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:35,046
<font color="yellow">You won't believe how many viewers have watched it.</font>

421
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:36,446
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

422
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

423
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:47,006
<font color="yellow">A passenger on the bus must have recorded a video.</font>

424
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:50,446
<font color="yellow">People are praising about how heartwarming this video is.</font>

425
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:52,576
<font color="yellow">You've become the hero in a moving story.</font>

426
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:54,246
<font color="yellow">This is embarrassing.</font>

427
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,776
<font color="yellow">I'm really proud of you, Dad.</font>

428
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:01,576
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of you, too, honey.</font>

429
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,106
<font color="yellow">This is so embarrassing.</font>

430
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:11,806
<font color="yellow">Hello? This is the gentleman of trot, Tae Pyung.</font>

431
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,476
<font color="yellow">A radio show?</font>

432
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,076
<font color="yellow">They want you to appear on a radio show?</font>

433
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,346
<font color="yellow">- Amazing! - Yes.</font>

434
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:22,376
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

435
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:27,006
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Tae Pyung's manager speaking.</font>

436
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:29,976
<font color="yellow">You'd like him to appear...</font>

437
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,006
<font color="yellow">as a guest singer at the Ice Flower Festival?</font>

438
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:35,646
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my goodness. - Okay.</font>

439
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:38,346
<font color="yellow">I'll call you right back after discussing things with my manager.</font>

440
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,476
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

441
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:43,606
<font color="yellow">Yes, please text us about the schedule first.</font>

442
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,806
<font color="yellow">Yes. Okay.</font>

443
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:49,806
<font color="yellow">You're getting a lot of calls. It looks like things will go well.</font>

444
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:50,806
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

445
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:54,976
<font color="yellow">Then let's cheer up to get this going.</font>

446
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:56,106
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

447
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,406
<font color="yellow">Gentleman of trot, Tae Pyung.</font>

448
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:00,146
<font color="yellow">My new song, "My Brother Goes".</font>

449
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,146
<font color="yellow">Please let it be a big hit!</font>

450
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:04,346
<font color="yellow">The magical cheer in 1, 2, 3.</font>

451
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:05,446
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - Let's go!</font>

452
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:06,906
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - Let's go.</font>

453
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,946
<font color="yellow">You look exceptionally pretty today.</font>

454
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:15,246
<font color="yellow">Is that really Tae Yang?</font>

455
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:19,476
<font color="yellow">He looks so awesome.</font>

456
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:25,176
<font color="yellow">Hey, I was watching.</font>

457
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:27,346
<font color="yellow">- Mum, will you be like this? - What?</font>

458
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:30,976
<font color="yellow">I've told you numerous times that I can't let Hyo Won and...</font>

459
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:33,876
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang get married, not even over my dead body.</font>

460
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:37,076
<font color="yellow">But if you keep adoring Tae Yang like that,</font>

461
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,606
<font color="yellow">will she listen to me?</font>

462
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:40,376
<font color="yellow">Why do you disapprove of Tae Yang...</font>

463
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:44,376
<font color="yellow">I mean, Kang Tae Yang so much?</font>

464
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:47,446
<font color="yellow">Mum, after you find out what kind of a guy he is,</font>

465
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:49,146
<font color="yellow">you will be more than shocked.</font>

466
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:54,906
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - We're back.</font>

467
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:58,546
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's with your outfit?</font>

468
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:02,706
<font color="yellow">I dressed up for Tae Yang.</font>

469
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:04,146
<font color="yellow">Hey, Tae Yang.</font>

470
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:06,776
<font color="yellow">You've gone so far that you have gone insane.</font>

471
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,146
<font color="yellow">I hate them.</font>

472
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,446
<font color="yellow">You. You have an odd taste.</font>

473
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:15,546
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

474
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:19,246
<font color="yellow">disabled somewhere?</font>

475
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,046
<font color="yellow">No. I didn't ask her to dress like this.</font>

476
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:24,676
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Unbelievable.</font>

477
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,006
<font color="yellow">Get changed right away!</font>

478
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:29,246
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

479
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:33,746
<font color="yellow">You're home, Hyo Won.</font>

480
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:36,606
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

481
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,046
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

482
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,346
<font color="yellow">Dinner is ready, Mother.</font>

483
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:45,806
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

484
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:47,676
<font color="yellow">Grab a bite before you go.</font>

485
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:50,306
<font color="yellow">I just had tteokbokki and gimbap. I'm fine, Mother.</font>

486
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:52,846
<font color="yellow">Tteokbokki and gimbap are not real food.</font>

487
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,746
<font color="yellow">Have a meal with a bowl of soup.</font>

488
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,376
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

489
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,506
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

490
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,376
<font color="yellow">What was that? What's with her?</font>

491
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:31,306
<font color="yellow">I heard your TV advertisement is receiving a lot of attention.</font>

492
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:34,746
<font color="yellow">It's not a lot, but people did notice.</font>

493
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:41,476
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

494
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:45,276
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing hanbok?</font>

495
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:46,946
<font color="yellow">I dressed up...</font>

496
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:49,046
<font color="yellow">for Tae Yang.</font>

497
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,306
<font color="yellow">Did you ask Hyo Won to wear hanbok?</font>

498
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:54,246
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

499
00:28:58,246 --> 00:28:59,776
<font color="yellow">Do I look prettier in hanbok,</font>

500
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:03,006
<font color="yellow">or does pooper look better?</font>

501
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:06,046
<font color="yellow">You look much prettier.</font>

502
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:08,646
<font color="yellow">I can hear you.</font>

503
00:29:08,806 --> 00:29:11,106
<font color="yellow">What a scene.</font>

504
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:12,846
<font color="yellow">I lost my appetite.</font>

505
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:14,446
<font color="yellow">I like this mood.</font>

506
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,146
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

507
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,806
<font color="yellow">Did you have fun on your honeymoon?</font>

508
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,046
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

509
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:21,646
<font color="yellow">You should have had fun.</font>

510
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:23,506
<font color="yellow">You won't be laughing again for a while.</font>

511
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,106
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

512
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,276
<font color="yellow">You should eat, Hyo Joo.</font>

513
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:32,706
<font color="yellow">I don't want to break up this cheerful mood.</font>

514
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:34,046
<font color="yellow">Have a great one.</font>

515
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:40,506
<font color="yellow">- I don't like her. - Me, too.</font>

516
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:44,006
<font color="yellow">She's just sour that things aren't going well with Dong Jin.</font>

517
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:49,676
<font color="yellow">Anyway, is Dong Jin still dating...</font>

518
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:51,076
<font color="yellow">your old friend?</font>

519
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,346
<font color="yellow">Yes. They set a date for a wedding.</font>

520
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:57,376
<font color="yellow">- A wedding? - A wedding?</font>

521
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:08,446
<font color="yellow">Ms Shiny Eyes, come and take a walk with me.</font>

522
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,846
<font color="yellow">Grab your coat and I'll see you at the door.</font>

523
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,506
<font color="yellow">A walk at this hour?</font>

524
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:18,306
<font color="yellow">This is great. I forgot to give it to him before.</font>

525
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:53,706
<font color="yellow">(Let's be pretty and shiny for all of our life.)</font>

526
00:30:57,476 --> 00:31:01,046
<font color="yellow">(Let's be pretty and shiny for all of our life.)</font>

527
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:09,676
<font color="yellow">(Let's be pretty and shiny for all of our life.)</font>

528
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:24,846
<font color="yellow">- Why are you laughing? - What's with that flower pot?</font>

529
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,476
<font color="yellow">Instead of a bouquet, I thought we could...</font>

530
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:29,806
<font color="yellow">grow this plant together.</font>

531
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:31,246
<font color="yellow">Was that funny?</font>

532
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:33,346
<font color="yellow">It wasn't funny,</font>

533
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:36,146
<font color="yellow">but I've never seen anyone give a flower pot during a proposal.</font>

534
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,376
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make it special.</font>

535
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,346
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd change it around.</font>

536
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:43,676
<font color="yellow">But we already have a date. Why are you proposing now?</font>

537
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:47,076
<font color="yellow">That's exactly why. You won't let me throw you a huge wedding...</font>

538
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:48,906
<font color="yellow">or let us live in a huge house.</font>

539
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:51,476
<font color="yellow">I wanted to at least give you a proposal.</font>

540
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:55,176
<font color="yellow">You don't even know anything. On top of that, you laughed.</font>

541
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:56,976
<font color="yellow">This is a mess.</font>

542
00:31:56,976 --> 00:32:00,646
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I laughed because you looked cute with a flower pot.</font>

543
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:03,076
<font color="yellow">Was I cute?</font>

544
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:07,406
<font color="yellow">Okay. It's too cold. Let's get in the car.</font>

545
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:15,606
<font color="yellow">You can't laugh now.

<font color="yellow">This is my proposal gift.</font>

547
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:37,376
<font color="yellow">I heard you gave your scissors to Ms Geum.</font>

548
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,746
<font color="yellow">I wanted to give it to you. It's a bit belated.</font>

549
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,676
<font color="yellow">I'm giving you this...</font>

550
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,646
<font color="yellow">to let you remember that your dream was to become...</font>

551
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:49,146
<font color="yellow">the best tailor in the country, so you have to achieve your dream.</font>

552
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:51,106
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

553
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:54,206
<font color="yellow">I will try very hard to become just that.</font>

554
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:59,706
<font color="yellow">And this is my gift to you.</font>

555
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:17,246
<font color="yellow">Come to think about it, I forgot to make a tie with the suit.</font>

556
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,846
<font color="yellow">I made that myself think it would look great on you.</font>

557
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:22,046
<font color="yellow">Do you like it?</font>

558
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,276
<font color="yellow">It's great.</font>

559
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:32,376
<font color="yellow">When a woman gives a man a tie as a gift,</font>

560
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,746
<font color="yellow">that means she wants to have him.</font>

561
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:40,246
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that Dong Jin is now Yun Shil's?</font>

562
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:42,376
<font color="yellow">It's a warning for you...</font>

563
00:33:42,376 --> 00:33:45,346
<font color="yellow">to never take your eyes off of me.</font>

564
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:49,646
<font color="yellow">Wow, if that's the case, I'll take that warning to my heart.</font>

565
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,046
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dong Jin. For being mine.</font>

566
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:56,946
<font color="yellow">Those were my words.</font>

567
00:33:57,646 --> 00:34:00,406
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You're the best.</font>

568
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,106
<font color="yellow">- Wait. - What?</font>

569
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,206
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure which one is the flower and which is you.</font>

570
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:18,446
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - Hold it up again.</font>

571
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:19,606
<font color="yellow">You're making fun of me.</font>

572
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:20,646
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

573
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:23,006
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, say something.</font>

574
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:26,376
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. Come on. - Yun Shil.</font>

575
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:27,776
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

576
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:31,546
<font color="yellow">You two are so loving, yet I tried to split you up.</font>

577
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:33,676
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

578
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,746
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, may I see you for a minute?</font>

579
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:48,076
<font color="yellow">What's this, Ms Choi?</font>

580
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:51,476
<font color="yellow">It'll take a fortune to prepare for a wedding.</font>

581
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:52,676
<font color="yellow">Please take it.</font>

582
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,646
<font color="yellow">I can't, Ms Choi.</font>

583
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:02,276
<font color="yellow">You haven't married Dong Jin yet,</font>

584
00:35:02,946 --> 00:35:05,746
<font color="yellow">so think of this as a gift from your own mother.</font>

585
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:08,646
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi...</font>

586
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:10,746
<font color="yellow">Once you two get married,</font>

587
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,476
<font color="yellow">I may be an in-law, but I'm still your mother.</font>

588
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,446
<font color="yellow">You can stop calling me Ms Choi.</font>

589
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,906
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you so much.</font>

590
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:27,606
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

591
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:36,376
<font color="yellow">What are you doing out in the cold?</font>

592
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:42,816
<font color="yellow">It's not much, but use it for your wedding.</font>

593
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:44,906
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

594
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,506
<font color="yellow">I've got enough money.</font>

595
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:49,476
<font color="yellow">I also got some from Ms Choi, too.</font>

596
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:51,776
<font color="yellow">It's from your father, so take it.</font>

597
00:35:52,506 --> 00:35:53,776
<font color="yellow">How many more times...</font>

598
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:56,316
<font color="yellow">could I give any pocket money to you?</font>

599
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:58,676
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

600
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,976
<font color="yellow">I'm saying...</font>

601
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:02,446
<font color="yellow">you two will have to give pocket money...</font>

602
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:04,316
<font color="yellow">to us from now on and longer.</font>

603
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:07,876
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about it and use it for your wedding.</font>

604
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,206
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's what you meant.</font>

605
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:11,876
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

606
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,476
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

607
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:17,406
<font color="yellow">I'll be good to you both and I'll work hard...</font>

608
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,276
<font color="yellow">to give a lot of pocket money to you two.</font>

609
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:20,906
<font color="yellow">Of course. I look forward to it.</font>

610
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,646
<font color="yellow">- You should rest. - Thank you.</font>

611
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:25,676
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight. - Sure.</font>

612
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:42,976
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

613
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:44,776
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

614
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,676
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry, did I surprise you? - What are you doing?</font>

615
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,346
<font color="yellow">I was watching you sleep.</font>

616
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:53,816
<font color="yellow">How can you be...</font>

617
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:56,776
<font color="yellow">so sexy and cool even when you sleep?</font>

618
00:36:58,106 --> 00:36:59,146
<font color="yellow">You're an odd one.</font>

619
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:00,946
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that before?</font>

620
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:03,376
<font color="yellow">I did, but today,</font>

621
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:06,546
<font color="yellow">you looked even sexier and cooler.</font>

622
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:08,676
<font color="yellow">Stop saying nonsense and let's sleep. I'm sleepy.</font>

623
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:10,606
<font color="yellow">Hey, Honey.</font>

624
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:12,546
<font color="yellow">About Young Eun.</font>

625
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:15,906
<font color="yellow">She closed down her store for a few days. Has she gone somewhere?</font>

626
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:18,546
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

627
00:37:19,046 --> 00:37:20,946
<font color="yellow">- Don't you really know? - No.</font>

628
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:24,316
<font color="yellow">Her phone is even turned off. I wonder what's going on.</font>

629
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:26,706
<font color="yellow">I have to go to work tomorrow.</font>

630
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:28,176
<font color="yellow">Let's just go to sleep.</font>

631
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,206
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

632
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:31,646
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to sleep?</font>

633
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:34,546
<font color="yellow">I can't seem to sleep. You can sleep first.</font>

634
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:42,046
<font color="yellow">She is overly suspicious these days.</font>

635
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:43,976
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

636
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:14,206
<font color="yellow">He's such a carefree soul.</font>

637
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:18,046
<font color="yellow">How could I tell him that I'm dying?</font>

638
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:22,906
<font color="yellow">I really can't do this.</font>

639
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:33,176
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking soju without any food?</font>

640
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,546
<font color="yellow">Did you fight with Sam Do?</font>

641
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,506
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm just depressed. - Sun Nyeo.</font>

642
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:41,876
<font color="yellow">I asked him man-to-man.</font>

643
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:45,446
<font color="yellow">There is nothing going on between him and that women from the bakery.</font>

644
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:46,906
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

645
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:50,846
<font color="yellow">Sam Do isn't the type to be in an affair.</font>

646
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,106
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

647
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:55,346
<font color="yellow">He may sound cold, but he only loves you.</font>

648
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,076
<font color="yellow">I can guarantee that.</font>

649
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:59,676
<font color="yellow">I wish he'd have an affair.</font>

650
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:01,506
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying? - What are you saying?</font>

651
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:04,906
<font color="yellow">Anyway.</font>

652
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:12,546
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad you two got together.</font>

653
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,246
<font color="yellow">When you become a famous singer,</font>

654
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,346
<font color="yellow">don't ever disregard Dong Sook.</font>

655
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:19,676
<font color="yellow">You should be good to him, too.</font>

656
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:23,046
<font color="yellow">I'm not concerned about anything else,</font>

657
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:25,776
<font color="yellow">but I'm sorry about the time I gave you a hard time...</font>

658
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:28,546
<font color="yellow">when you first came to get the money to fix your guitar.</font>

659
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:32,546
<font color="yellow">I should have made your favourite stir-fried chicken more often, too.</font>

660
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:34,506
<font color="yellow">Those are both on my mind.</font>

661
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:39,076
<font color="yellow">Why do you bring up such an old story?</font>

662
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,476
<font color="yellow">He's right. It's as if you are leaving to somewhere far.</font>

663
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:42,676
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

664
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:44,606
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

665
00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:46,816
<font color="yellow">I just thought of this and that...</font>

666
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,316
<font color="yellow">as I grabbed a drink.</font>

667
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:50,446
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

668
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:51,906
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

669
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,506
<font color="yellow">It's as if she is about to die any day soon.</font>

670
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:01,346
<font color="yellow">Wait, could she be diagnosed with a terminal illness?</font>

671
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:02,846
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

672
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:05,576
<font color="yellow">No, something is off.</font>

673
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:09,376
<font color="yellow">She would never drink just soju.</font>

674
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:19,576
<font color="yellow">- Who is it? - It's me, Mother.</font>

675
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

676
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:22,476
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

677
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,106
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang is leaving.</font>

678
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:32,046
<font color="yellow">- Already? - It's over 11pm already.</font>

679
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:35,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

680
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:39,406
<font color="yellow">Can you play just one round with me before you leave?</font>

681
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:42,206
<font color="yellow">Do you know how to play cards?</font>

682
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:45,976
<font color="yellow">I've seen my grandmother play.</font>

683
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,106
<font color="yellow">I can play a bit.</font>

684
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:51,246
<font color="yellow">That's great. Let's play just one round.</font>

685
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:52,746
<font color="yellow">I can't seem to fall asleep.</font>

686
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,106
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You're embarrassing.</font>

687
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:57,906
<font color="yellow">What's there to be embarrassed...</font>

688
00:40:57,906 --> 00:40:59,746
<font color="yellow">between Tae Yang and I?</font>

689
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:02,176
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, am I embarrassing you?</font>

690
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:03,676
<font color="yellow">No, never.</font>

691
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,576
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

692
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,906
<font color="yellow">- Let's play one round, then. - Okay.</font>

693
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:12,576
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it. - Okay, let's get started.</font>

694
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,046
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

695
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:27,046
<font color="yellow">Is that rice for breakfast?</font>

696
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:28,576
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

697
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:30,816
<font color="yellow">You're always a huge help.</font>

698
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:38,706
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

699
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:41,446
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

700
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:44,176
<font color="yellow">You have to help...</font>

701
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:46,976
<font color="yellow">me and Mother to be close.</font>

702
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,476
<font color="yellow">Please give me information about her, too.</font>

703
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:52,146
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I mean?</font>

704
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:55,476
<font color="yellow">Are you still doing something?</font>

705
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:58,246
<font color="yellow">Let's go to sleep. I'm tired.</font>

706
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:00,246
<font color="yellow">No, I'm done.</font>

707
00:42:00,946 --> 00:42:02,676
<font color="yellow">- Great job today. - Sure.</font>

708
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:04,746
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight. - Goodnight.</font>

709
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:12,476
<font color="yellow">She really is foxy.</font>

710
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,476
<font color="yellow">She's very manipulative.</font>

711
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:17,706
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

712
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:21,546
<font color="yellow">Don't get the card.</font>

713
00:42:24,206 --> 00:42:25,676
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

714
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:29,946
<font color="yellow">Okay, now.</font>

715
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:33,446
<font color="yellow">You don't have enough cards,</font>

716
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:35,976
<font color="yellow">and I'm on round three.</font>

717
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:40,076
<font color="yellow">And this card means I get another double score.</font>

718
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:44,906
<font color="yellow">Okay. I have the birds and blue flags.</font>

719
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:47,816
<font color="yellow">I made a fortune!</font>

720
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:50,076
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

721
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:54,316
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang doesn't have any money. Stop it, Mum.</font>

722
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,606
<font color="yellow">Why would I stop?</font>

723
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:57,676
<font color="yellow">I'm on a roll.</font>

724
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,006
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

725
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,946
<font color="yellow">May I come in?</font>

726
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:04,676
<font color="yellow">What? Well...</font>

727
00:43:05,606 --> 00:43:07,476
<font color="yellow">Give me a second. Hide it.</font>

728
00:43:16,146 --> 00:43:17,576
<font color="yellow">What are you all doing here?</font>

729
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:19,146
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

730
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:21,576
<font color="yellow">We were just...</font>

731
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,676
<font color="yellow">chatting. What is it?</font>

732
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:26,706
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

733
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:29,646
<font color="yellow">I came to say goodnight.</font>

734
00:43:29,746 --> 00:43:32,106
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

735
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:35,706
<font color="yellow">Goodnight to you, too. Have a sweet dream.</font>

736
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,776
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang. Aren't you going home?</font>

737
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:40,906
<font color="yellow">Why do you care...</font>

738
00:43:41,446 --> 00:43:42,846
<font color="yellow">if he stays or goes?</font>

739
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,806
<font color="yellow">Yes, exactly.</font>

740
00:43:45,576 --> 00:43:47,476
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang and I still have matters to discuss.</font>

741
00:43:47,776 --> 00:43:49,246
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about us...</font>

742
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,276
<font color="yellow">and go sleep.</font>

743
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:55,646
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

744
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:02,476
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - Hey.</font>

745
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:13,846
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lawyer.</font>

746
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:15,476
<font color="yellow">Hong Gi Pyo got bailed out.</font>

747

<font color="yellow">He'll be released tomorrow.</font>

748
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:18,946
<font color="yellow">Is this a hard fact?</font>

749
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:23,176
<font color="yellow">I've met all the major shareholders.</font>

763
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,706
<font color="yellow">Thanks for coming to pick me up.</font>

764
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:10,976
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

765
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:14,646
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to make the trip. Thanks.</font>

766
00:46:15,176 --> 00:46:17,076
<font color="yellow">I'm not here for that.</font>

767
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:20,406
<font color="yellow">I hope you don't make me regret...</font>

768
00:46:20,406 --> 00:46:22,706
<font color="yellow">paying to bail you out.</font>

769
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:26,876
<font color="yellow">We want the same thing.</font>

770
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:28,876
<font color="yellow">I don't have to say what, do I?</font>

771
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:30,506
<font color="yellow">You don't.</font>

772
00:46:30,676 --> 00:46:33,506
<font color="yellow">I can't wait to get started. I have to go.</font>

773
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,146
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Yes, Sir.</font>

774
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:58,076
<font color="yellow">As you can see, your wife seems to have...</font>

775
00:46:58,076 --> 00:46:59,876
<font color="yellow">shacked up with her boss.</font>

776
00:46:59,876 --> 00:47:03,206
<font color="yellow">They love each other so much. They kiss and hug in public...</font>

777
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:04,846
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

778
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:07,346
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk about her like that?</font>

779
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:08,346
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Boss.</font>

780
00:47:08,346 --> 00:47:11,546
<font color="yellow">You know that he tends to shoot off his mouth.</font>

781
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:14,376
<font color="yellow">Don't take it to heart. Have some tofu.</font>

782
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:30,506
<font color="yellow">Honey. Wife, can I come in?</font>

783
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:32,306
<font color="yellow">Yes, come in.</font>

784
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:38,976
<font color="yellow">- Did you sleep well? - Of course.</font>

785
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:40,576
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

786
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:43,906
<font color="yellow">You don't look like you slept well.</font>

787
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:46,846
<font color="yellow">You didn't sleep a wink without me.</font>

788
00:47:47,806 --> 00:47:49,206
<font color="yellow">I did sleep well.</font>

789
00:47:49,206 --> 00:47:51,176
<font color="yellow">This won't do. I'll put you to bed from now on.</font>

790
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,846
<font color="yellow">What if someone overhears?</font>

791
00:47:53,846 --> 00:47:56,646
<font color="yellow">Who cares? We'll be married soon.</font>

792
00:47:57,046 --> 00:47:59,106
<font color="yellow">You're so childish. Let's go.</font>

793
00:47:59,106 --> 00:48:01,476
<font color="yellow">I have to help Mother cook breakfast.</font>

794
00:48:01,706 --> 00:48:02,746
<font color="yellow">"Mother"?</font>

795
00:48:04,076 --> 00:48:07,776
<font color="yellow">She told me to call her that from now on.</font>

796
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:09,876
<font color="yellow">Do you like it that much?</font>

797
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:13,846
<font color="yellow">Of course I do. It feels like I finally have a family of my own.</font>

798
00:48:13,846 --> 00:48:15,446
<font color="yellow">I feel so happy.</font>

799
00:48:17,846 --> 00:48:21,346
<font color="yellow">What should I wear to work today?</font>

800
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:24,446
<font color="yellow">Should I wear this?</font>

801
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:26,676
<font color="yellow">What's this box?</font>

802
00:48:27,576 --> 00:48:29,576
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen this before?</font>

803
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,106
<font color="yellow">Did she go shopping again? Let's see.</font>

804
00:48:33,206 --> 00:48:34,976
<font color="yellow">(Will)</font>

805
00:48:37,606 --> 00:48:39,006
<font color="yellow">(Will)</font>

806
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,876

<font color="yellow">(Will)</font>

808
00:48:47,706 --> 00:48:48,746
<font color="yellow">A will?</font>

809
00:48:49,976 --> 00:48:52,206
<font color="yellow">"First, on my last moment, Bae Sam Do should hold my hands..."</font>

<font color="yellow">"and kiss on my forehead."</font>

811

814
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,276
<font color="yellow">What is she up to?</font>

815
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:13,446
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, where are you?</font>

816
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,106
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo.</font>

817
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,246
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

818
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,546
<font color="yellow">I just went to get tofu and beansprouts.</font>

819
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,206
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

820
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,276
<font color="yellow">How did you find that?</font>

821
00:49:25,776 --> 00:49:26,876
<font color="yellow">Give it back.</font>

822
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:31,276
<font color="yellow">Fess up.</font>

823
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:34,706
<font color="yellow">What are all these pictures and letters? Tell me now!</font>

824
00:49:35,546 --> 00:49:37,046
<font color="yellow">Tell me right now!</font>

825
00:49:37,276 --> 00:49:39,906
<font color="yellow">What happened now, Sam Do?</font>

826
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:41,406
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, what's wrong?</font>

827
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:44,576
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

828
00:49:46,076 --> 00:49:47,106
<font color="yellow">dying.</font>

829
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,246
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

830
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:51,806
<font color="yellow">- You're dying? - What?</font>

831
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:57,476
<font color="yellow">I went to see a doctor because I'd been having...</font>

832
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:59,506
<font color="yellow">bad headaches and dizzy spells.</font>

833
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,776
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

834
00:50:03,006 --> 00:50:06,606
<font color="yellow">He said it could be a brain tumour so I had some tests done.</font>

835
00:50:08,346 --> 00:50:09,346
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

836
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:11,276
<font color="yellow">Did you get the results back?</font>

837
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:16,606
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

838
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:18,806
<font color="yellow">Is it really a tumour?</font>

839
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:23,976
<font color="yellow">The doctor said he has to tell me in person.</font>

840
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,676
<font color="yellow">He told me to come by...</font>

841
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:28,906
<font color="yellow">but I was too scared to.</font>

842
00:50:34,276 --> 00:50:35,846
<font color="yellow">I'm scared, Sam Do.</font>

843
00:50:36,746 --> 00:50:38,046
<font color="yellow">I don't want to die.</font>

844
00:50:39,976 --> 00:50:43,206
<font color="yellow">Stop saying such silly things. Who said you're going to die?</font>

845
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:46,246
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about it for a few days.</font>

846
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:49,546
<font color="yellow">You'll help anyone and everyone get a loan...</font>

847
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,446
<font color="yellow">and you're so clueless.</font>

848
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:54,806
<font color="yellow">I can't bear the idea of leaving you alone.</font>

849
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:58,076
<font color="yellow">I can't die like this.</font>

850
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:03,046
<font color="yellow">Poor Sun Nyeo.</font>

851
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:07,476
<font color="yellow">Medicine has advanced in leaps and bounds.</font>

852
00:51:07,476 --> 00:51:10,706
<font color="yellow">Let's go and talk to the doctor first.</font>

853
00:51:10,706 --> 00:51:13,806
<font color="yellow">- Yes, let's go. - Come with me.</font>

854
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:15,476
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

855
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:18,276
<font color="yellow">- I won't go. - Why not?</font>

856
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:20,346
<font color="yellow">I'm too scared.</font>

857
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:23,876
<font color="yellow">Even if you are, we need to see the doctor...</font>

858
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:27,406
<font color="yellow">and discuss what kind of treatments are available.</font>

859
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:32,206
<font color="yellow">I can't go.</font>

860
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,046
<font color="yellow">I won't go.</font>

861
00:51:38,706 --> 00:51:41,276
<font color="yellow">I think she's having a headache.</font>

862
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:43,076
<font color="yellow">Poor Sun Nyeo.</font>

863
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:46,746
<font color="yellow">I know what I have.</font>

864
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:48,846
<font color="yellow">It's terminal.</font>

865
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:51,176
<font color="yellow">There's no hope.</font>

866
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,506
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. You aren't a doctor!</font>

867
00:51:55,006 --> 00:51:59,506
<font color="yellow">He's right. I know you're scared, but let's go and see the doctor.</font>

868
00:51:59,846 --> 00:52:02,606
<font color="yellow">Let's hear what he has to say.</font>

869
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:08,246
<font color="yellow">If the doctor confirms my suspicions...</font>

870
00:52:09,146 --> 00:52:11,446
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can last another day.</font>

871
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:14,776
<font color="yellow">I can't go to the hospital.</font>

872
00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:18,246
<font color="yellow">Stop being so silly. You have to come with me.</font>

873
00:52:18,246 --> 00:52:20,046
<font color="yellow">I don't want to!</font>

874
00:52:21,176 --> 00:52:23,906
<font color="yellow">Get up. I won't let you die.</font>

875
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:25,176
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung, help me.</font>

876
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:26,606
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

877
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:29,076
<font color="yellow">- Get up. We're going. - I'm not going!</font>

878
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:31,046
<font color="yellow">- Come along. - Come with us.</font>

879
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:32,876
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go.</font>

880
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:34,906
<font color="yellow">We'll take her straight there.</font>

881
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:37,446
<font color="yellow">Bring our coats and follow right away.</font>

882
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,706
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - I said I'm not going!</font>

883
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:40,846
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

884
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:44,476
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go!</font>

885
00:52:51,106 --> 00:52:54,006
<font color="yellow">What took you so long? The results came out long ago.</font>

886
00:52:54,206 --> 00:52:56,276
<font color="yellow">Weren't you under a lot of stress?</font>

887
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:59,046
<font color="yellow">I was, because of the terrible headaches.</font>

888
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:03,046
<font color="yellow">The thought of hearing the results...</font>

889
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,006
<font color="yellow">scared me too much.</font>

890
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:07,246
<font color="yellow">We are...</font>

891
00:53:09,046 --> 00:53:11,046
<font color="yellow">ready to hear the news.</font>

892
00:53:13,976 --> 00:53:15,406
<font color="yellow">Tell us, Doctor.</font>

893
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:16,946
<font color="yellow">How much longer...</font>

894
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:20,176
<font color="yellow">will I live?</font>

895
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:24,746
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

896
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:28,276
<font color="yellow">I have cancer.</font>

897
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:35,206
<font color="yellow">You don't.</font>

898
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:38,746
<font color="yellow">After hearing your symptoms, I ran a medical checkup...</font>

899
00:53:38,746 --> 00:53:40,706
<font color="yellow">starting from blood panel to scans.</font>

900
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:44,506
<font color="yellow">You don't have a tumor or brain haemorrhage.</font>

901
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:46,506
<font color="yellow">- She doesn't? - I don't?</font>

902
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:49,106
<font color="yellow">No, you don't.</font>

903
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,276
<font color="yellow">Then why did I have all those headaches?</font>

904
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:55,046
<font color="yellow">I thought my head was going to split in two.</font>

905
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:58,206
<font color="yellow">The tests results show that you have a pressure headache...</font>

906
00:53:58,206 --> 00:54:01,076
<font color="yellow">caused by a leak of cerebrospinal fluid.</font>

907
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:03,046
<font color="yellow">A pressure headache because of a leak?</font>

908
00:54:03,046 --> 00:54:04,876
<font color="yellow">What kind of illness is that?</font>

909
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:07,006
<font color="yellow">Is that a threat to her life?</font>

910
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:09,676
<font color="yellow">Not at all. You have nothing to worry about.</font>

911
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:14,346
<font color="yellow">Let me explain exactly what you have.</font>

912
00:54:14,346 --> 00:54:17,546
<font color="yellow">There's water inside our head that protects our brain.</font>

913
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:19,976
<font color="yellow">There's a hole somewhere in your body...</font>

914
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:22,106
<font color="yellow">and that water is leaking.</font>

915
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:26,446
<font color="yellow">A shortage of that water can cause excruciating headaches...</font>

916
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:30,076
<font color="yellow">and nausea, all of which you suffered from.</font>

917
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:33,846
<font color="yellow">Can you cure her with surgery?</font>

918
00:54:34,246 --> 00:54:36,646
<font color="yellow">We'll find a leak with a special scan.</font>

919
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:39,346
<font color="yellow">Plugging that should solve the problem.</font>

920
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:42,506
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

921
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:46,576
<font color="yellow">So I won't die?</font>

922
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:55,576
<font color="yellow">What's taking them so long?</font>

923
00:54:56,346 --> 00:54:58,106
<font color="yellow">I have a bad feeling about this.</font>

924
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:01,906
<font color="yellow">We should have gone in with them.</font>

925
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:03,506
<font color="yellow">Maybe we should have.</font>

926
00:55:04,406 --> 00:55:07,606
<font color="yellow">Perhaps we should have told your parents before we left.</font>

927
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:11,276
<font color="yellow">It's not too late to tell them once we're sure.</font>

928
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:21,876
<font color="yellow">- Did you get the results? - Yes.</font>

929
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:25,876
<font color="yellow">She has to get admitted right away.</font>

930
00:55:27,376 --> 00:55:28,646
<font color="yellow">Oh no...</font>

931
00:55:29,646 --> 00:55:32,376
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry for you.</font>

932
00:55:33,006 --> 00:55:34,406
<font color="yellow">How could this be?</font>

933
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:38,576
<font color="yellow">Don't drag it out. Tell them the truth.</font>

934
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:44,446
<font color="yellow">I slightly...</font>

935
00:55:44,946 --> 00:55:46,506
<font color="yellow">overreacted.</font>

936
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:49,876
<font color="yellow">- I don't have cancer. - What?</font>

937
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:52,006
<font color="yellow">You don't?</font>

938
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:54,446
<font color="yellow">You don't?</font>

939
00:55:56,276 --> 00:55:57,746
<font color="yellow">Then why do they want to admit you?</font>

940
00:55:57,806 --> 00:55:59,676
<font color="yellow">They want her admitted...</font>

941
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:01,776
<font color="yellow">to get a procedure done.</font>

942
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:03,746
<font color="yellow">- A procedure? - A procedure?</font>

943
00:56:05,606 --> 00:56:08,106
<font color="yellow">You are going to shorten...</font>

944
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:09,606
<font color="yellow">my life. Seriously.</font>

945
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,376
<font color="yellow">I'm going to lose my mind.</font>

946
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,076
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sam Do.</font>

947
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,246
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

948
00:56:26,776 --> 00:56:27,876
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

949
00:56:34,446 --> 00:56:36,006
<font color="yellow">Since you're all in the industry,</font>

950
00:56:36,006 --> 00:56:38,706
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you've heard of Tonelli of Italy.</font>

951
00:56:39,346 --> 00:56:40,646
<font color="yellow">Wolgyesu Tailor Shop...</font>

952
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:43,476
<font color="yellow">will open Tonelli's first flagship store in Asia...</font>

953
00:56:44,076 --> 00:56:46,906
<font color="yellow">as their partner.</font>

954
00:56:48,346 --> 00:56:49,406
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

955
00:56:50,846 --> 00:56:53,946
<font color="yellow">We will not stop at being a branch for them.</font>

956
00:56:54,276 --> 00:56:55,546
<font color="yellow">We will create Wolgyesu-Tonelli,</font>

957
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:57,646
<font color="yellow">a new brand,</font>

958
00:56:58,076 --> 00:56:59,646
<font color="yellow">which creates tailor-made suits.</font>

959
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:02,606
<font color="yellow">Of course, in order to maintain consistency within the brand,</font>

960
00:57:03,076 --> 00:57:05,106
<font color="yellow">we will provide a joint training with Tonelli.</font>

961
00:57:05,406 --> 00:57:07,406
<font color="yellow">We'll establish a system in which a tailor who passes the training...</font>

962
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:09,176
<font color="yellow">will become a master...</font>

963
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:12,776
<font color="yellow">and will be able to participate in the manufacture process.</font>

964
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:16,176
<font color="yellow">This is the union that I am trying to explain.</font>

965
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:19,446
<font color="yellow">All of you...</font>

966
00:57:20,076 --> 00:57:21,646
<font color="yellow">have worked with my father,</font>

967
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:23,676
<font color="yellow">Lee Man Sool,</font>

968
00:57:24,046 --> 00:57:26,506
<font color="yellow">and he personally recommended you.</font>

969
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,546
<font color="yellow">So I'm sure you'll have plenty of influence.</font>

970
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:30,846
<font color="yellow">Naturally.</font>

971
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:33,606
<font color="yellow">Going back to business,</font>

972
00:57:33,606 --> 00:57:36,406
<font color="yellow">we will purchase all fabrics and materials...</font>

973
00:57:36,946 --> 00:57:39,476
<font color="yellow">to maintain consistent quality and market strength.</font>

974
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:41,646
<font color="yellow">The database, which will include all patterns,</font>

975
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:44,046
<font color="yellow">will be shared digitally.</font>

976
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:45,606
<font color="yellow">Of course, the database...</font>

977
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:47,476
<font color="yellow">will be shared with Tonelli as well.</font>

978
00:57:47,906 --> 00:57:50,846
<font color="yellow">Thus, we will be able to cooperate...</font>

979
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,606
<font color="yellow">as partners with Tonelli,</font>

980
00:57:52,976 --> 00:57:55,176
<font color="yellow">the best in the world.</font>

981
00:57:56,276 --> 00:57:57,346
<font color="yellow">I'm touched.</font>

982
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:00,246
<font color="yellow">People mocked us, calling us useless tailors.</font>

983
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:02,276
<font color="yellow">I'm about to tear up.</font>

984
00:58:02,976 --> 00:58:05,976
<font color="yellow">Must we close the shops we currently run?</font>

985
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:08,706
<font color="yellow">No. If you go through the training and are accepted...</font>

986
00:58:08,706 --> 00:58:10,206
<font color="yellow">as a master, as I mentioned,</font>

987
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:14,746
<font color="yellow">you'll be given a license to use the Wolgyesu-Tonelli name.</font>

988
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:17,546
<font color="yellow">After creating the suit at your shop.</font>

989
00:58:17,776 --> 00:58:19,746
<font color="yellow">You may mark it, using that license.</font>

990
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,606
<font color="yellow">Then as a member,</font>

991
00:58:21,876 --> 00:58:24,376
<font color="yellow">we get training, participate in the manufacturing process...</font>

992
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,106
<font color="yellow">and gain a joint brand label as well.</font>

993
00:58:26,176 --> 00:58:29,076
<font color="yellow">That's right. The reason for this unity is to raise...</font>

994
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:31,406
<font color="yellow">profit and class.</font>

995
00:58:33,946 --> 00:58:36,646
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, you have a very impressive son.</font>

996
00:58:36,906 --> 00:58:37,976
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

997
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:47,406
<font color="yellow">If we don't want banks to retrieve our loans,</font>

998
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:50,246
<font color="yellow">we must announce the collaboration with Tonelli.</font>

999
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:51,546
<font color="yellow">How many times must I tell you that?</font>

1000
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:54,306
<font color="yellow">We tried various routes to request a meeting with Mr Gianni,</font>

1001
00:58:54,506 --> 00:58:55,906
<font color="yellow">but he said...</font>

1002
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:58,746
<font color="yellow">meeting Meesa Apparel is not in his agenda, and refused.</font>

1003
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:02,276
<font color="yellow">Even if we cannot work together with them,</font>

1004
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:05,376
<font color="yellow">we can't let them partner up with Wolgyesu.</font>

1005
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:08,246
<font color="yellow">So, get the planning team to figure out...</font>

1006
00:59:08,246 --> 00:59:10,546
<font color="yellow">- what we need to do to stop it! - Yes, Sir.</font>

1007
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:12,146
<font color="yellow">If we can't eat it,</font>

1008
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:14,076
<font color="yellow">we make sure no one else does!</font>

1009
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,606
<font color="yellow">- That's my business rule! - Yes, Sir.</font>

1010
00:59:28,676 --> 00:59:29,746
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

1011
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:32,906
<font color="yellow">You didn't go to work?</font>

1012
00:59:33,346 --> 00:59:35,246
<font color="yellow">- I'm off until today. - I see.</font>

1013
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:37,176
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

1014
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:41,546
<font color="yellow">Let's shake off the bad feelings we have toward each other...</font>

1015
00:59:41,776 --> 00:59:42,976
<font color="yellow">and get along.</font>

1016
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:45,346
<font color="yellow">We're family now.</font>

1017
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:47,206
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

1018
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:49,006
<font color="yellow">Since Tae Yang ask, too.</font>

1019
00:59:49,576 --> 00:59:50,846
<font color="yellow">Let's get along.</font>

1020
00:59:56,976 --> 00:59:59,046
<font color="yellow">- Why are you shaking hands? - It's nothing.</font>

1021
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:05,146
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Tae Yang's shoot.</font>

1022
01:00:05,546 --> 01:00:06,806
<font color="yellow">You should go, too.</font>

1023
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:08,976
<font color="yellow">I'll just get kicked out again.</font>

1024
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:11,476
<font color="yellow">I won't bother.</font>

1025
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,946
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come home after the shoot...</font>

1026
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:17,046
<font color="yellow">and play cards with me.</font>

1027
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,506
<font color="yellow">You took all his money last night, and now you're hooked.</font>

1028
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:21,376
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Bye.</font>

1029
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:26,776
<font color="yellow">She cares more about Tae Yang than her own mom already.</font>

1030
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:33,106
<font color="yellow">Hi, Hee Sun.</font>

1031
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:34,976
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

1032
01:00:35,906 --> 01:00:36,976
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

1033
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:44,106
<font color="yellow">A rumour? What kind of a rumour?</font>

1034
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:46,876
<font color="yellow">I feel like the woman in the rumour...</font>

1035
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,576
<font color="yellow">sounds like your daughter-in-law.</font>

1036
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:52,646
<font color="yellow">I didn't know whether or not to tell you,</font>

1037
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:55,276
<font color="yellow">but I thought you should know.</font>

1038
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:56,706
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1039
01:00:57,376 --> 01:00:59,876

1040
01:01:00,646 --> 01:01:04,146

1041

<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1042
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,476

1044

<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1045
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,046
<font color="yellow">Thanks for your concern.</font>

1046

<font color="yellow">Send me the article first, okay?</font>

1047
01:01:21,706 --> 01:01:22,706
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

<font color="yellow">I thought it'd be super comfortable living with Ji Yun,</font>
