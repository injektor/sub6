<font color="yellow">I should go home and get some rest.</font>

157
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:11,552
<font color="yellow">Is it hot?</font>

158
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:18,852
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it good? - Yes.</font>

159
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,982
<font color="yellow">Did I keep you waiting long?</font>

160
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,282
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

161
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,512
<font color="yellow">I just got here, too.</font>

162
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,682
<font color="yellow">- Where's Hyo Won? - I just took her home.</font>

163
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,352
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that, Mother?</font>

164
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:56,552
<font color="yellow">(Announcer C, the daughter-in-law of a top menswear company...)</font>

165
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,912
<font color="yellow">Those two people mentioned in that message.</font>

166
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:03,712
<font color="yellow">It's you and Ji Yun, isn't it?</font>

167
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:08,812
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

168
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:12,352
<font color="yellow">It's very exaggerated,</font>

169
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,482
<font color="yellow">but it's true that Ji Yun and I dated when we were in university.</font>

170
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:17,482
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

171
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:22,582
<font color="yellow">How can you have the audacity to date Hyo Won?</font>

172
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:26,882
<font color="yellow">Does Hyo Won know about it as well?</font>

173
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,082
<font color="yellow">Yes, she does.</font>

174
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:32,252
<font color="yellow">That foolish girl.</font>

175
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,412
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Don't call me like that.</font>

176
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:39,112
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me. You must have...</font>

177
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,012
<font color="yellow">approached Hyo Won intentionally to get back at Ji Yun.</font>

178
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,782
<font color="yellow">No, that's not what happened. I swear.</font>

179
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:47,952
<font color="yellow">Do you actually expect me to believe that?</font>

180
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:52,312
<font color="yellow">How I feel about Hyo Won has nothing to do with this. I'm serious.</font>

181
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,512
<font color="yellow">Even if that's the case, I can't allow the two of you to get married,</font>

182
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:00,452
<font color="yellow">now that Hyo Sang and Ji Yun are married. I absolutely can't.</font>

183
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,982
<font color="yellow">What I had with Ji Yun in the past shouldn't affect our relationship.</font>

184
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,482
<font color="yellow">Now that I look back,</font>

185
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,582
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun and I were more like friends who were there for each other...</font>

186
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:13,112
<font color="yellow">Who's going to believe that? No one will believe you.</font>

187
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,412
<font color="yellow">I mean, people are already gossiping about you two.</font>

188
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,312
<font color="yellow">It must have surprised you, and you must be concerned about it.</font>

189
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:21,982
<font color="yellow">But I'll be better to Hyo Won and prove myself to you.</font>

190
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,852
<font color="yellow">You sure have a way with words.</font>

191
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,112
<font color="yellow">This world isn't an easy place.</font>

192
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:34,252
<font color="yellow">You seduced Hyo Won by sweet-talking like this...</font>

193
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:37,752
<font color="yellow">just to toy with her emotions, didn't you?</font>

194
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:40,882
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? That's not true at all.</font>

195
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:44,312
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep this short. Get out of Hyo Won's life.</font>

196
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,712
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

197
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,582
<font color="yellow">- What? - If I was going to give up,</font>

198
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:57,712
<font color="yellow">I would've done so when I found out that Hyo Won is Hyo Sang's sister.</font>

199
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:00,612
<font color="yellow">It's too late now. I cannot break up with her.</font>

200
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:02,512
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd be like this.</font>

201
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,952
<font color="yellow">I can't believe how shameless you are.</font>

202
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:08,752
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won is a part of me now.</font>

203
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,982
<font color="yellow">I can't even imagine a life without her.</font>

204
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,852
<font color="yellow">If she's not in my life, I won't be able to breathe.</font>

205
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:21,812
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to think at all, either.</font>

206
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,812
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won is my everything.</font>

207
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,482
<font color="yellow">How dare you try to trick me?</font>

208
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:36,582
<font color="yellow">My quick wits are what got me to where I am now.</font>

209
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:39,782
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll be swayed by your sweet talks?</font>

210
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,212
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - You'd better...</font>

211
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,982
<font color="yellow">break up with Hyo Won immediately,</font>

212
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:45,052
<font color="yellow">or I'll have to take drastic measures.</font>

213
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,312
<font color="yellow">Is he still with his friend?</font>

214
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,252
<font color="yellow">Break up with Tae Yang.</font>

215
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:27,182
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about all of a sudden, Mum?</font>

216
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,652
<font color="yellow">Did you not hear me?</font>

217
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,952
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me why. Just break up with him immediately.</font>

218
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:36,312
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Mum?</font>

219
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:40,552
<font color="yellow">Did my darling make a mistake or something?</font>

220
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:43,312
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to hear you calling him Darling any more!</font>

221
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,182
<font color="yellow">What's going on? You're scaring me.</font>

222
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,252
<font color="yellow">All this time...</font>

223
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,252
<font color="yellow">- Why did you fool me? - What do you mean?</font>

224
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,452
<font color="yellow">I heard that Tae Yang and Ji Yun...</font>

225
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,582
<font color="yellow">dated in the past.</font>

226
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,952
<font color="yellow">- Mum, how did you know that? - That's not important.</font>

227
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,712
<font color="yellow">Do you not have any pride?</font>

228
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,352
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't say anything if it was someone else.</font>

229
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,912
<font color="yellow">How can you want to marry a guy who used to be in love with Ji Yun?</font>

230
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,612
<font color="yellow">Are you dumb? Are you an idiot?</font>

231
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,782
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past. Why should it matter?</font>

232
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:18,452
<font color="yellow">- What? - Tae Yang didn't do anything wrong.</font>

233
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:22,252
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun dumped Tae Yang after she met Hyo Sang because Hyo Sang is rich.</font>

234
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,882
<font color="yellow">You should pity him if anything.</font>

235
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:26,352
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

236
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:29,312
<font color="yellow">It looks like you've lost your mind.</font>

237
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,282
<font color="yellow">She's a bad person because she dumped him.</font>

238
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:33,312
<font color="yellow">Why are you blaming Tae Yang when he's the one who was dumped?</font>

239
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:34,952
<font color="yellow">He's the victim.</font>

240
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:38,312
<font color="yellow">Shut it! Break up now unless you want to infuriate me more.</font>

241
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:40,282
<font color="yellow">Don't disgrace our family.</font>

242
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:42,682
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. I absolutely cannot break up with him.</font>

243
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,512
<font color="yellow">You little... How dare you!</font>

244
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:52,882
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

245
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:55,982
<font color="yellow">I've never...</font>

246
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:58,952
<font color="yellow">hit you before.</font>

247
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,082
<font color="yellow">It shows how serious...</font>

248
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,752
<font color="yellow">and desperate I am about this matter.</font>

249
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:09,252
<font color="yellow">No means no.</font>

250
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,252
<font color="yellow">Don't be so bullheaded.</font>

251
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,812
<font color="yellow">End it with him completely.</font>

252
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,082
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

253
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:17,552
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

254
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:18,752
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

255
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,352
<font color="yellow">Even if you beat me up to a pulp,</font>

256
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,552
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

257
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,282
<font color="yellow">I'll never give up on Tae Yang.</font>

258
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,282
<font color="yellow">Hey. You!</font>

259
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:34,082
<font color="yellow">You stop right there. Stop!</font>

260
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:36,282
<font color="yellow">Stop right there...</font>

261
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,552
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

262
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,652
<font color="yellow">- Hey, did you have a good day? - Yes.</font>

263
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:51,352
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hyo Won. Are you crying right now?</font>

264
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:55,582
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with her?</font>

265
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,082
<font color="yellow">Why are you sitting there looking all spaced out?</font>

266
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:08,512
<font color="yellow">Read the newspaper or something.</font>

267
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,182
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

268
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,512
<font color="yellow">Shall I get herbal medicine made for you?</font>

269
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,182
<font color="yellow">You seem to get tired easily.</font>

270
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:16,712
<font color="yellow">Gok Ji,</font>

271
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:20,352
<font color="yellow">why don't we use this comforter ourselves?</font>

272
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,612
<font color="yellow">Let's not give it to Dong Jin and Yun Shil.</font>

273
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,012
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - Dong Jin and Yun Shil...</font>

274
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,682
<font color="yellow">have long years to live and they have great things ahead.</font>

275
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,012
<font color="yellow">Why don't we enjoy some luxury ourselves?</font>

276
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,612
<font color="yellow">Don't be too serious.</font>

277
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,422
<font color="yellow">They'll use this comforter when they come back from honeymoon.</font>

278
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,952
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to use this one?</font>

279
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:40,652
<font color="yellow">I'd like to fall asleep in a nice comforter with you.</font>

280
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,952
<font color="yellow">You're getting silly as you grow old.</font>

281
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:47,612
<font color="yellow">Can you thread a needle for me?</font>

282
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:50,112
<font color="yellow">My eyes are blurry. I can't see the eye of the needle.</font>

283
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:52,922
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

284
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,952
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

285
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:03,552
<font color="yellow">Can't you see this?</font>

286
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,512
<font color="yellow">I see it.</font>

287
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,952
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, then?</font>

288
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,552
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm tired. My hands are shaking.</font>

289
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,952
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the oriental medicine clinic tomorrow.</font>

290
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:17,052
<font color="yellow">Mum, we're home.</font>

291
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:18,952
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

292
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,082
<font color="yellow">You must be tired.</font>

293
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,582
<font color="yellow">I will do it, Mother.</font>

294
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,352
<font color="yellow">She's so happy...</font>

295
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:36,152
<font color="yellow">that you told her to call you Mother.</font>

296
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,852
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to have a daughter like Yun Shil.</font>

297
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:43,612
<font color="yellow">Let's not have a silly conflict between us.</font>

298
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,312
<font color="yellow">We'll be happy together.</font>

299
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:46,922
<font color="yellow">Sure, Mother.</font>

300
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:49,112
<font color="yellow">I'll do the sewing.</font>

301
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:50,652
<font color="yellow">No, leave it to me.</font>

302
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:54,652
<font color="yellow">This is my present for you and Dong Jin.</font>

303
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,752
<font color="yellow">Your sewing skill might be better than mine,</font>

304
00:18:58,152 --> 00:18:59,782
<font color="yellow">but I'd like to finish this myself.</font>

305

<font color="yellow">Get me down.</font>

393
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:22,452
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you cook any meat when I came back in a long time?</font>

394
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:25,352
<font color="yellow">- It's all tofu dishes. - Stop talking.</font>

395
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:26,882
<font color="yellow">Eat all these...</font>

396
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:29,812
<font color="yellow">and never go near to the penitentiary again.</font>

397
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:31,052
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

398
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,682
<font color="yellow">Here you go, my son.</font>

399
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:37,882
<font color="yellow">Did you sometimes see Yun Shil?</font>

400
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,882
<font color="yellow">Well, a few days ago,</font>

401
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:44,352
<font color="yellow">she came with some meat and fruit, and asked to change your mind.</font>

402
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:47,212
<font color="yellow">Have you met Yun Shil yet?</font>

403
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:49,812
<font color="yellow">- No. - I thought you'd meet her...</font>

404
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:52,452
<font color="yellow">right after you came out. That's strange.</font>

405
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,012
<font color="yellow">Have you given up on her?</font>

406
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,752
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

407
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:59,382
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

408
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:02,652
<font color="yellow">She didn't like you and flirted with another man.</font>

409
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:05,412
<font color="yellow">Just forget her...</font>

410
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:07,082
<font color="yellow">and go away.</font>

411
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,382
<font color="yellow">You don't need to have feeling for her. That's nonsense.</font>

412
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:14,082
<font color="yellow">You made the right decision.</font>

413
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,552
<font color="yellow">I will find better woman...</font>

414
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,552
<font color="yellow">for you to be your wife,</font>

415
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,012
<font color="yellow">someone much better than Yun Shil.</font>

416
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,712
<font color="yellow">I can't give up on Yun Shil...</font>

417
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,382
<font color="yellow">as long as I'm alive.</font>

418
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,282
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

419
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,752
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone I'm out for a while, Mum.</font>

420
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,282
<font color="yellow">Even to Yun Shil. Do you get it?</font>

421
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,282
<font color="yellow">This tastes amazing.</font>

422
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:45,352
<font color="yellow">Now that he came out after all that, he would do his part.</font>

423
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:53,882
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang.</font>

424
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:05,112
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? You didn't give me a call.</font>

425
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,712
<font color="yellow">Mum hit me.</font>

426
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:11,112
<font color="yellow">- What? - She found out...</font>

427
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:13,912
<font color="yellow">what happened between you and Ji Yun.</font>

428
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:17,482
<font color="yellow">So she told me to break up with you.</font>

429
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:19,412
<font color="yellow">I told her I couldn't...</font>

430
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:21,912
<font color="yellow">and she slapped me on the face.</font>

431
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:23,882
<font color="yellow">Mother shouldn't have done that.</font>

432
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,412
<font color="yellow">How could she hit you?</font>

433
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,412
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

434
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,282
<font color="yellow">- Did it hurt? - Yes.</font>

435
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,352
<font color="yellow">It hurt so much.</font>

436
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:47,112
<font color="yellow">The urgent appointment you said,</font>

437
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,452
<font color="yellow">was it with Mum?</font>

438
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,682
<font color="yellow">Did she tell you to break up with me?</font>

439
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:01,952
<font color="yellow">Yes, she did.</font>

440
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:04,312
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

441
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:07,712
<font color="yellow">Do you have to ask that? I surely answered no.</font>

442
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:11,212
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

443
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,812
<font color="yellow">Did my mum slap you as well?</font>

444
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:24,482
<font color="yellow">She didn't, so don't worry.</font>

445
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:26,082
<font color="yellow">I'll leave home right away.</font>

446
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:29,652
<font color="yellow">I'll ask her to delete me from the family records.</font>

447
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:32,012
<font color="yellow">I won't put up with violence.</font>

448
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:36,382
<font color="yellow">She lashed out at you in surprise and anger.</font>

449
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:38,712
<font color="yellow">Try to understand.</font>

450
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:41,812
<font color="yellow">I can't. I'm going to leave home.</font>

451
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:43,912
<font color="yellow">I'll move in with you.</font>

452
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:46,512
<font color="yellow">There you go again.</font>

453
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:49,412
<font color="yellow">Let me take you home.</font>

454
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:54,152
<font color="yellow">My mum might scream and curse at you...</font>

455
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:56,312
<font color="yellow">and she might even hit you.</font>

456
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,252
<font color="yellow">If that scared me,</font>

457
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:06,552
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have dated you in the first place.</font>

458
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:09,682
<font color="yellow">I understand how your mum feels.</font>

459
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,882
<font color="yellow">The only thing I can do is persuade her...</font>

460
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:21,282
<font color="yellow">by showing her how sincere I am.</font>

461
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,582
<font color="yellow">You brats.</font>

462
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:40,752
<font color="yellow">You deceived me...</font>

463
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,912
<font color="yellow">and got married.</font>

464
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,852
<font color="yellow">I can't believe my daughter-in-law...</font>

465
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:50,282
<font color="yellow">used to date my son-in-law!</font>

466
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,452
<font color="yellow">Since Hyo Sang and Ji Yun are already married,</font>

467
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:56,212
<font color="yellow">I won't allow you two.</font>

468
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:57,752
<font color="yellow">Break up.</font>

469
00:28:57,752 --> 00:28:59,982
<font color="yellow">Why should we break up because of them?</font>

470
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:03,182
<font color="yellow">- No, I won't do that. - How dare you.</font>

471
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:08,752
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, it's up to you now.</font>

472
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:10,282
<font color="yellow">Persuade her into leaving you.</font>

473
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:16,012
<font color="yellow">As I told you before, I cannot do that, Mother.</font>

474
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,212
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

475
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:21,412
<font color="yellow">You just do as she says. How dare you object!</font>

476
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:22,852
<font color="yellow">Break up right now!</font>

477
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:25,152
<font color="yellow">If one of us must break up,</font>

478
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:26,812
<font color="yellow">then it should be you.</font>

479
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:31,682
<font color="yellow">- There's no way it'll be us. - You aren't making any sense.</font>

480
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:34,852
<font color="yellow">Your brother and I are already legally married.</font>

481
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:36,782
<font color="yellow">You have no right to make any comments!</font>

482
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:43,752
<font color="yellow">Don't be so stubborn. Tae Yang and Hyo Won...</font>

483
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,252
<font color="yellow">must break up. That's the right thing to do.</font>

484
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,712
<font color="yellow">I won't do that.</font>

485
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:49,882
<font color="yellow">I'll move out if I must.</font>

486
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:51,652
<font color="yellow">I won't leave Tae Yang.</font>

487
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:53,312
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Hyo Won.</font>

488
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:57,112
<font color="yellow">Does Tae Yang mean more to you...</font>

489
00:29:57,382 --> 00:29:59,452
<font color="yellow">than your own mum and brother?</font>

490
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:01,482
<font color="yellow">My moving out will solve all the problems.</font>

491
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:03,412
<font color="yellow">If I stop being your daughter and sister...</font>

492
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,712
<font color="yellow">I won't have to break up with Tae Yang.</font>

493
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,052
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

494
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:16,952
<font color="yellow">How could you say such a thing?</font>

495
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,712
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Mother.</font>

496
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:23,312
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

497
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:24,912
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

498
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:26,412
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - What's wrong?</font>

499
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:28,782
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Mum? Are you okay?</font>

500
00:30:32,512 --> 00:30:35,282
<font color="yellow">- Can you not talk, Mum? - Mother!</font>

501
00:30:35,812 --> 00:30:38,012
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no. - Mum.</font>

502
00:30:38,012 --> 00:30:40,812
<font color="yellow">I think she has aphasia.</font>

503
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:42,652
<font color="yellow">- Aphasia? - Aphasia?</font>

504
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:48,382
<font color="yellow">- Mum, try to relax and breathe. - Mum.</font>

505
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,582
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

506
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,952
<font color="yellow">Why is she suddenly unable to speak?</font>

507
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:03,212
<font color="yellow">I'll need to run some tests to be sure,</font>

508
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:07,282
<font color="yellow">but based on her condition, an immense shock...</font>

509
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,512
<font color="yellow">caused her to lose her ability to speak.</font>

510
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:12,182
<font color="yellow">So does she have aphasia?</font>

511
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:16,212
<font color="yellow">Yes. Bring her to the hospital for a medical check up.</font>

512
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:17,252
<font color="yellow">Is there a cure?</font>

513
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:20,082
<font color="yellow">For severe cases, I recommend psychiatric treatment,</font>

514
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:23,852
<font color="yellow">but it's best to discuss that once we have the test results.</font>

515
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,812
<font color="yellow">Make sure she doesn't get stressed...</font>

516
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:28,082
<font color="yellow">and keep her relaxed at all times.</font>

517
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:33,512
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm really sorry.</font>

518
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,752
<font color="yellow">Say something.</font>

519
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,082
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

520
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:50,082
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

521
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:54,082
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry, Mother. - How can you call her like that?</font>

522
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,482
<font color="yellow">Not in front of the doctor, honey.</font>

523
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,882
<font color="yellow">It's my fault.</font>

524
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:15,052
<font color="yellow">I said I'd stop being her daughter.</font>

525
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:17,712
<font color="yellow">That's why she got so upset.</font>

526
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:28,452
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself.</font>

527
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:31,012
<font color="yellow">She'll recover soon.</font>

528
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:34,752
<font color="yellow">The doctor said she'll recover...</font>

529
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,252
<font color="yellow">once she calms down.</font>

530
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:42,152
<font color="yellow">Why is it so difficult?</font>

531
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:46,612
<font color="yellow">Isn't it enough that we love each other?</font>

532
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:50,452
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone so determined to break us up?</font>

533
00:32:55,382 --> 00:32:56,982
<font color="yellow">Cry all you want.</font>

534
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:27,752
<font color="yellow">You're awake.</font>

535
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:32,052
<font color="yellow">I must have fallen asleep.</font>

536
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:35,712
<font color="yellow">Where are Dong Sook and Tae Pyung?</font>

537
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,152
<font color="yellow">They went home.</font>

538
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:39,312
<font color="yellow">You should've gone with them.</font>

539
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:43,552
<font color="yellow">You should get a good sleep. You have to work tomorrow.</font>

540
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,452
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

541
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:48,452
<font color="yellow">I can't work with you lying here.</font>

542
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,582
<font color="yellow">What's the point in making suits when you're sick?</font>

543
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:55,382
<font color="yellow">You've grown up.</font>

544
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:59,082
<font color="yellow">You were begging for a divorce just a few days ago.</font>

545
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:01,912
<font color="yellow">That was because I got infuriated...</font>

546
00:34:01,912 --> 00:34:04,182
<font color="yellow">because you kept acting up.</font>

547
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,752
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

548
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,682
<font color="yellow">I had no idea you were so sick.</font>

549
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:16,982
<font color="yellow">I'm a terrible husband.</font>

550
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:21,852
<font color="yellow">Thinking about how sad and scared you must have felt...</font>

551
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,752
<font color="yellow">all that while...</font>

552
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:28,212
<font color="yellow">My heart breaks.</font>

553
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:31,452
<font color="yellow">I deserve to die.</font>

554
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:38,452
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself. It's my fault for not telling you.</font>

555
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:42,152
<font color="yellow">I promise that from now on,</font>

556
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:46,012
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you like how the prince treats the princess...</font>

557
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:48,552
<font color="yellow">in a fairy story.</font>

558
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:51,752
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare take that back.</font>

559
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:55,112
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

560
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:13,712
<font color="yellow">Your wife needs to rest.</font>

561
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:16,212
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

562
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:19,212
<font color="yellow">Will she be okay, Doctor?</font>

563
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,682
<font color="yellow">Yes. We located the right spot...</font>

564
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:24,412
<font color="yellow">and the surgery went well. You don't need to worry about it.</font>

565
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:27,212
<font color="yellow">You might have lingering headaches while your body replenishes...</font>

566
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,822
<font color="yellow">the cerebrospinal fluid.</font>

567
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:31,412
<font color="yellow">It would be best if you stay in bed.</font>

568
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:34,322
<font color="yellow">You should recover in three days.</font>

569
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:36,612
<font color="yellow">Make sure she drinks a lot of water.</font>

570
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,952
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

571
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:41,712
<font color="yellow">If water leaks from my brain...</font>

572
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:43,752
<font color="yellow">does that cause forgetfulness as well?</font>

573
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:46,082
<font color="yellow">Ever since I had those headaches...</font>

574
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:48,082
<font color="yellow">I've been forgetting things.</font>

575
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:51,882
<font color="yellow">Headaches have many causes and so does forgetfulness.</font>

576
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,082
<font color="yellow">In severe cases we'd suspect dementia,</font>

577
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:59,082
<font color="yellow">but your tests results were clean so that's not a concern.</font>

578

762
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:35,512
<font color="yellow">It wasn't my intention to hide it from you.</font>

763
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:38,612
<font color="yellow">But it's clearly all my fault. I don't have a leg to stand on.</font>

764
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:41,152
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

765
00:47:41,912 --> 00:47:44,012
<font color="yellow">I can promise you that I've never done anything...</font>

766
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:46,682
<font color="yellow">to shame or dishonor you nor Hyo Won.</font>

767
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:51,452
<font color="yellow">Also, my love for your daughter was truly sincere and pure.</font>

768
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,152
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

769
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:02,082
<font color="yellow">Mum. Mum.</font>

770
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,412
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

771
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,282
<font color="yellow">Quickly.</font>

772
00:48:12,312 --> 00:48:14,512
<font color="yellow">Your legs feel numb, don't they?</font>

773
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:16,182
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

774
00:48:23,682 --> 00:48:26,712
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. They hurt a lot, don't they?</font>

775
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:27,982
<font color="yellow">I'm all right.</font>

776
00:48:30,212 --> 00:48:32,952
<font color="yellow">It will only make Mother more upset. Why does he keep coming?</font>

777
00:48:35,252 --> 00:48:39,082
<font color="yellow">- Is the oriental medicine ready? - Yes, I warmed it up just right.</font>

778
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:43,082
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. The smell of oriental medicine.</font>

779
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:51,112
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

780
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:53,452
<font color="yellow">She's cunning as a fox.</font>

781
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:03,612
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

782
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,382
<font color="yellow">I've warmed up some medicine for you.</font>

783
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:20,582
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Mother?</font>

784
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:28,812
<font color="yellow">(Did you really...)</font>

785
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:33,012
<font color="yellow">(break up with Tae Yang...)</font>

786
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,652
<font color="yellow">(for my son's money?)</font>

787
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:45,282
<font color="yellow">"Did you really break up..."</font>

788
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,412
<font color="yellow">"with Tae Yang for my son's money?"</font>

789
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:52,612
<font color="yellow">How many times have I told you? That's not true.</font>

790
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:55,152
<font color="yellow">It was Hyo Sang's ambitious...</font>

791
00:49:55,252 --> 00:49:57,482
<font color="yellow">and dignified features that made me fall in love with him.</font>

792
00:49:58,052 --> 00:49:59,952
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you the truth.</font>

793
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:04,612
<font color="yellow">I did date Tae Yang for a long time,</font>

794
00:50:04,912 --> 00:50:08,782
<font color="yellow">but our relationship wasn't as serious as you think.</font>

795
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:12,182
<font color="yellow">I can swear on my late parents.</font>

796
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:14,952
<font color="yellow">Leave. Get out.</font>

797
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:19,782
<font color="yellow">You want me to leave?</font>

798
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:21,682
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll leave as you say.</font>

799
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:39,912
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

800
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,682
<font color="yellow">There's no need for you to apologise.</font>

801
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:44,182
<font color="yellow">I'm the one that should be sorry.</font>

802
00:50:45,282 --> 00:50:47,082
<font color="yellow">This is so frustrating.</font>

803
00:50:47,482 --> 00:50:49,482
<font color="yellow">The doctor said nothing's wrong.</font>

804
00:50:49,482 --> 00:50:51,582
<font color="yellow">I wonder why she still can't talk.</font>

805
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:54,982
<font color="yellow">I sometimes feel like she's doing this on purpose.</font>

806
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:56,752
<font color="yellow">Why say such a thing?</font>

807
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,712
<font color="yellow">Why would she do this on purpose?</font>

808
00:50:59,712 --> 00:51:01,882
<font color="yellow">Your second exam is coming up.</font>

809
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:05,052
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're having trouble in concentrating because of Mum.</font>

810
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:06,582
<font color="yellow">The exam isn't important...</font>

811
00:51:06,882 --> 00:51:08,912
<font color="yellow">because your mother can't speak any more.</font>

812
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:10,882
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

813
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,712
<font color="yellow">This is so upsetting.</font>

814
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:19,552
<font color="yellow">The doctor said it caused by shock.</font>

815
00:51:19,552 --> 00:51:22,452
<font color="yellow">As time passes, I'm sure she'll start to understand...</font>

816
00:51:22,852 --> 00:51:24,412
<font color="yellow">and eventually learn to speak again.</font>

817
00:51:33,852 --> 00:51:36,452
<font color="yellow">So don't get too upset.</font>

818
00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:42,512
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

819
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:48,382
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

820
00:51:49,712 --> 00:51:51,312
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil will be receiving her gifts from the groom today,</font>

821
00:51:51,312 --> 00:51:53,552
<font color="yellow">so I might not be able to answer your call.</font>

822
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,152
<font color="yellow">Gifts from the groom?</font>

823
00:51:57,612 --> 00:52:00,982
<font color="yellow">You mean Dong Jin and Yun Shil are really getting married?</font>

824
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:12,912
<font color="yellow">Did something happen this afternoon?</font>

825
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:15,252
<font color="yellow">No, nothing happened.</font>

826
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:17,652
<font color="yellow">I feel suspicious.</font>

827
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:20,982
<font color="yellow">You told me to stay put at the tailor shop.</font>

828
00:52:21,412 --> 00:52:24,652
<font color="yellow">That was because although we were apart for a while,</font>

829
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:25,952
<font color="yellow">I suddenly missed you so much.</font>

830
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:28,252
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you to wait for me there.</font>

831
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:32,982
<font color="yellow">Who told you to be so charming?</font>

832
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:35,852
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

833
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:43,582
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

834
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,752
<font color="yellow">Did you prepare this all by yourself?</font>

835
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:47,782
<font color="yellow">I noticed people order everything nowadays.</font>

836
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:49,852
<font color="yellow">This rice cake is made...</font>

837
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:52,582
<font color="yellow">to prevent misfortune...</font>

838
00:52:52,582 --> 00:52:55,512
<font color="yellow">and brings the bride and groom closer together.</font>

839
00:52:55,512 --> 00:52:59,352
<font color="yellow">Therefore, mother must make it as it gives the best wishes.</font>

840
00:52:59,652 --> 00:53:03,012
<font color="yellow">Mum, why is there only one chestnut?</font>

841
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:05,482
<font color="yellow">Chestnuts and jujubes symbolises...</font>

842
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,882
<font color="yellow">giving birth to many sons and daughters.</font>

843
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:12,112
<font color="yellow">The bride must eat this, so don't think of eating it.</font>

844
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:15,252
<font color="yellow">Can I have a baby if I eat that?</font>

845
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:24,082
<font color="yellow">You must be feeling better now that you're talking about babies.</font>

846
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:26,382
<font color="yellow">You must be. You are you feeling?</font>

847
00:53:26,382 --> 00:53:28,212
<font color="yellow">My energy's back...</font>

848
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:30,082
<font color="yellow">and my headache's gone. I feel good.</font>

849
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:31,782
<font color="yellow">That's good news.</font>

850
00:53:31,782 --> 00:53:33,612
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't be wasting time here.</font>

851
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:36,012
<font color="yellow">It's time for the groom to arrive. Let's hurry up.</font>

852
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,282
<font color="yellow">- All right. - All right.</font>

853
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:39,352
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

854
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:51,612
<font color="yellow">Why? Do I look weird?</font>

855
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:53,582
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You look beautiful.</font>

856
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:56,312
<font color="yellow">I was just amazed at how beautiful you are again.</font>

857
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:58,482
<font color="yellow">The elders will hear you.</font>

858
00:54:00,452 --> 00:54:01,652
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

859
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:04,312
<font color="yellow">Since the gifts are arriving today,</font>

860
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:08,112
<font color="yellow">let's take a picture to remember this day.</font>

861
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:13,512
<font color="yellow">Come and get the gifts!</font>

862
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:14,952
<font color="yellow">They must have arrived.</font>

863
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:19,382
<font color="yellow">Come and get the gifts!</font>

864
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,712
<font color="yellow">The gifts are here!</font>

865
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:25,512
<font color="yellow">- The gifts are here! - Come and get the gifts!</font>

866
00:54:26,552 --> 00:54:29,352
<font color="yellow">Come and get the gifts!</font>

867
00:54:31,912 --> 00:54:34,152
<font color="yellow">It's cold out there. Why don't you just go inside?</font>

868
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:38,712
<font color="yellow">Look. The groom is empty-handed.</font>

869
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:40,612
<font color="yellow">You have no manners.</font>

870
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:43,482
<font color="yellow">I guess we'll just have to hit your soles until they're on fire.</font>

871
00:54:43,482 --> 00:54:45,412
<font color="yellow">Let me give you this on behalf of the groom.</font>

872
00:54:45,412 --> 00:54:47,282
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee. You shouldn't have.</font>

873
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:51,652
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let's see.</font>

874
00:54:52,552 --> 00:54:55,712
<font color="yellow">I think we can move to the front yard with this much of money.</font>

875
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:57,412
<font color="yellow">Squid, move forward.</font>

876
00:54:57,412 --> 00:55:00,982
<font color="yellow">- Let's move forward. - To the front yard.</font>

877
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:03,252
<font color="yellow">We can't be too nice.</font>

878
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:05,482
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. We're moving all the way to the front yard.</font>

879
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:11,882
<font color="yellow">- Come and get the gifts! - The gifts are here!</font>

880
00:55:11,882 --> 00:55:14,412
<font color="yellow">My father just paid you for them.</font>

881
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:17,912
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? That was to move to the front yard.</font>

882
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:21,252
<font color="yellow">We'll surely need more to move from here to the bride's room.</font>

883
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,882
<font color="yellow">Nonsense. I gave you more than enough.</font>

884
00:55:23,882 --> 00:55:26,382
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

885
00:55:26,382 --> 00:55:28,712
<font color="yellow">Our carrier refuses to budge because we don't have...</font>

886
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:30,982
<font color="yellow">enough labour money. What shall we do?</font>

887
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:32,652
<font color="yellow">We're in a difficult situation here.</font>

888
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:34,652
<font color="yellow">- Can I have some water, too? - The food is getting cold.</font>

889
00:55:34,652 --> 00:55:36,112
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come inside.</font>

890
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:39,782
<font color="yellow">They give me no choice. I'll have to use my good looks.</font>

891
00:55:39,782 --> 00:55:42,152
<font color="yellow">My good looks. My charm.</font>

892
00:55:44,752 --> 00:55:45,752
<font color="yellow">My good looks.</font>

893
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:47,212
<font color="yellow">One step backwards.</font>

894
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:50,112
<font color="yellow">- Why? - It's my turn, then.</font>

895
00:55:50,712 --> 00:55:52,412
<font color="yellow">Okay. You try.</font>

896
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:57,752
<font color="yellow">Is our carrier feeling all right?</font>

897
00:55:57,752 --> 00:55:59,982
<font color="yellow">Three steps forward!</font>

898
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:02,512
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

899
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:06,652
<font color="yellow">- My wife is just as sexy. - My husband is the best.</font>

900
00:56:08,682 --> 00:56:10,312
<font color="yellow">We'll be up until dawn.</font>

901
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:12,852
<font color="yellow">Wrap it up and come inside. The food will get cold.</font>

902
00:56:12,852 --> 00:56:14,582
<font color="yellow">That won't be possible.</font>

903
00:56:14,912 --> 00:56:17,782
<font color="yellow">All right. Let me close the deal here and now.</font>

904
00:56:18,552 --> 00:56:20,852
<font color="yellow">Here. Will this do it, Sam Do?</font>

905
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,882
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - What do you think?</font>

906
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:29,112
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can go inside with this amount?</font>

907
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:33,252
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

908
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:35,012
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

909
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:39,252
<font color="yellow">the groom will break this.</font>

910
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:42,012
<font color="yellow">May all the misfortune go away!</font>

911
00:56:42,552 --> 00:56:43,552
<font color="yellow">I'm going to break it now.</font>

912
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:59,782
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is not only our daughter-in-law but like a daughter.</font>

913
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:02,152
<font color="yellow">So your mother and I prepared...</font>

914
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,882
<font color="yellow">both gifts for the bride and groom.</font>

915
00:57:06,352 --> 00:57:08,612
<font color="yellow">She was like a daughter to us,</font>

916
00:57:08,612 --> 00:57:11,012
<font color="yellow">so it wasn't easy to come all this way.</font>

917
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:12,282
<font color="yellow">Above all,</font>

918
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:14,852
<font color="yellow">it must have been hard for both of you.</font>

919
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:18,112
<font color="yellow">You went through all that...</font>

920
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:21,182
<font color="yellow">and only good things will be ahead.</font>

921
00:57:22,812 --> 00:57:24,712
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say much.</font>

922
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:27,312
<font color="yellow">Just have a married life like that of your parents.</font>

923
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,012
<font color="yellow">That's the right answer.</font>

924
00:57:32,152 --> 00:57:33,552
<font color="yellow">Everyone, clap your hands!</font>

925
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,182
<font color="yellow">Mum said...</font>

926
00:57:37,712 --> 00:57:39,712
<font color="yellow">you have to eat this, so I brought it.</font>

927
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:43,912
<font color="yellow">You have to eat chestnut and jujube,</font>

928
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:45,912
<font color="yellow">so that we can have a lot of children.</font>

929
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:53,052
<font color="yellow">- You should eat too, Dong Jin. - The bride is supposed to eat it.</font>

930
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,082
<font color="yellow">Eat it quickly.</font>

931
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:56,982
<font color="yellow">Oh, can you give me the phone?</font>

932
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:00,552
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

933
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:02,612
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

934
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,152
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

935
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,082
<font color="yellow">I downloaded a location tracking application.</font>

936
00:58:10,082 --> 00:58:11,212
<font color="yellow">A location tracking application?</font>

937
00:58:12,082 --> 00:58:14,712
<font color="yellow">- Why do you need that? - Husband and wife are one.</font>

938
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:16,652
<font color="yellow">We should know where the other is.</font>

939
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:20,112
<font color="yellow">We're together at the tailor shop and home.</font>

940
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:21,252
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why we need it.</font>

941
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:25,382
<font color="yellow">- Is something wrong? - No, nothing is wrong.</font>

942
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:29,312
<font color="yellow">Here you go. I wonder you want to keep a secret to me.</font>

943
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:31,382
<font color="yellow">- No, I don't. - It's all right, then.</font>

944
00:58:32,682 --> 00:58:34,812
<font color="yellow">It must have been hard for you today.</font>

945
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,612
<font color="yellow">Is everything all right?</font>

946
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:39,082
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

947
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:41,912
<font color="yellow">Finish eating now.</font>

948
00:58:51,282 --> 00:58:52,582
<font color="yellow">This is Hong Gi Pyo speaking.</font>

949
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:55,482
<font color="yellow">Your wife received a wedding present box today.</font>

950
00:58:56,982 --> 00:58:58,682
<font color="yellow">Are you going to just wait and see?</font>

951
00:58:58,682 --> 00:59:02,012
<font color="yellow">Why don't you do anything after you came out of the prison?</font>

952
00:59:02,712 --> 00:59:04,052
<font color="yellow">Do you think I paid for all the bail...</font>

953
00:59:04,982 --> 00:59:06,382
<font color="yellow">for you to do nothing?</font>

954
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:08,282
<font color="yellow">Don't order me to do anything.</font>

955
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:09,812
<font color="yellow">I'll take care it myself.</font>

956
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:32,352
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

957
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:42,082
<font color="yellow">Here we are.</font>

958
00:59:43,612 --> 00:59:47,582
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. It's so beautiful. - I agree.</font>

959
00:59:47,812 --> 00:59:50,012
<font color="yellow">I'd like to have a wedding again at such a nice place like here.</font>

960
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:52,752
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about in front of your husband?</font>

961
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,482
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have a wedding again?</font>

962
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:59,352
<font color="yellow">I mean with you, not with another man. All right?</font>

963
00:59:59,352 --> 01:00:01,582
<font color="yellow">With me? You should have said that.</font>

964
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:03,682
<font color="yellow">What a sight!</font>

965
01:00:04,952 --> 01:00:06,552
<font color="yellow">The groom is here.</font>

966
01:00:07,012 --> 01:00:08,052
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

967
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:12,052
<font color="yellow">- Where are Mum and Dad? - They're coming in aunt's car.</font>

968
01:00:12,212 --> 01:00:13,452
<font color="yellow">They'll be here soon.</font>

969
01:00:13,612 --> 01:00:15,482
<font color="yellow">I see. Get inside. It's cold.</font>

970
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:17,352
<font color="yellow">- All right. - Let's take a look.</font>

971
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,452
<font color="yellow">It's beautiful.</font>

972
01:00:22,112 --> 01:00:23,552
<font color="yellow">Do you need to tell me something?</font>

973
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:30,552
<font color="yellow">I really cherish this, but you can have it.</font>

974
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:33,112
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

975
01:00:36,852 --> 01:00:37,952
<font color="yellow">You're so silly.</font>

976
01:00:38,382 --> 01:00:41,212
<font color="yellow">You may need this, Dong Jin doesn't.</font>

977
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:43,652
<font color="yellow">He needs this. Don't you see?</font>

978
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:46,012
<font color="yellow">He's been just studying since he was young. He's not strong.</font>

979
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:47,552
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

980
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:51,312
<font color="yellow">This is the blue tablet the big shots take when they go climbing.</font>

981
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,912
<font color="yellow">You keep this and use it when you need.</font>

982
01:00:55,912 --> 01:00:57,682
<font color="yellow">Neither Dong Jin nor I need that.</font>

983
01:00:57,682 --> 01:00:58,912
<font color="yellow">You know what,</font>

984
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:01,082
<font color="yellow">I don't need it myself.</font>

985
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:04,152
<font color="yellow">By the way, where's Yun Shil?</font>

986
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,282
<font color="yellow">She's wearing the bridal makeup.</font>

987
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:07,552
<font color="yellow">She'll come with Tae Yang.</font>

988
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:09,782
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take just one?</font>

989
01:01:11,852 --> 01:01:13,152
<font color="yellow">He doesn't give up.</font>

990
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:14,612
<font color="yellow">How come he keeps it in this pocket all the time?</font>

991
01:01:57,152 --> 01:01:59,552
<font color="yellow">Do I look all right? Isn't the makeup too heavy?</font>

992
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:00,712
<font color="yellow">You're beautiful.</font>

993
01:02:01,082 --> 01:02:02,712
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin will love it.</font>

994
01:02:05,212 --> 01:02:07,812
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right, by the way? - What do you mean?</font>

995
01:02:08,052 --> 01:02:10,882
<font color="yellow">I heard that Madam Ko got very angry.</font>

996
01:02:11,112 --> 01:02:13,112
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You're the bride today.</font>

997
01:02:13,812 --> 01:02:16,712
<font color="yellow">Don't mind my business. Just think about yourself.</font>

998
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:17,952
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

999
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:20,012
<font color="yellow">I mean, aunt.</font>

1000
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:23,952
<font color="yellow">- I packed everything. - Thank you.</font>

1001
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,082
<font color="yellow">I'll bring the car.</font>

1002
01:02:25,082 --> 01:02:26,312
<font color="yellow">- Wait for a minute. - All right.</font>

1003
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:29,782
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Aunt. - All right.</font>

1004
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:34,282
<font color="yellow">Where is he? He's keeping the bride waiting.</font>

1005
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,712
<font color="yellow">I don't like this.</font>

1006
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,912
<font color="yellow">I left my bag packing your things.</font>

1007
01:02:43,752 --> 01:02:45,512
<font color="yellow">- Stay here for a second. - All right.</font>

1008
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,152
<font color="yellow">You look stunning.</font>

1009
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:32,082
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

1010
01:03:32,082 --> 01:03:34,382
<font color="yellow">I came here to talk with you.</font>

1011

1020
01:04:23,312 --> 01:04:25,612
<font color="yellow">She was right here.</font>

1021
01:04:25,912 --> 01:04:27,282
