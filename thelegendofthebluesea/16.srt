48

51
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:15,213

52
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:21,913

53
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,093
<font color="yellow">How lonely would you have been?</font>

54

<font color="yellow">Mommy had no idea...</font>

55
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,063
<font color="yellow">That's why</font>

56
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,413
<font color="yellow">you can't go anywhere anymore.</font>

57
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:45,753
<font color="yellow">When we are apart, you don't know anything.</font>

58
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:50,193
<font color="yellow">So, don't go anywhere.</font>

59
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:06,653
<font color="yellow">Really? The ahjumma that works at Si Ah's was Joon Jae's mom?</font>

60
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,853
<font color="yellow">Yeah, so the two of them are talking right now.</font>

61
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:14,193
<font color="yellow">It's not just Joon Jae who's been searching for his mom. I've also searched for her everywhere.</font>

62
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,003
<font color="yellow">But I can't believe she was right here all along!</font>

63
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:20,293
<font color="yellow">It's something to congratulate them for,</font>

64
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,863
<font color="yellow">but what about your birthday party? It's a little ambiguous now.</font>

65
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:26,083
<font color="yellow">That's true. Why did you make it today of all days?</font>

66
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,913
<font color="yellow">It's because I picked the right date that Heo Joon Jae met his mom.</font>

67
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:35,613
<font color="yellow">That's true, too. Not only are you better at speaking, you've become perfectly logical, too.</font>

68
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,993
<font color="yellow">The plate's empty over here.</font>

69
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:54,043
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

70
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,143
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing.</font>

71
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:59,763
<font color="yellow">This place doesn't refill very well.</font>

72
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:03,953
<font color="yellow">Other parties never let the dishes go empty.</font>

73
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:13,323
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy. What is this?</font>

74
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:17,063
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there's something. Something huge.</font>

75
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:22,663
<font color="yellow">I couldn't have dreamt that this was the house you lived in.</font>

76
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:26,873
<font color="yellow">I didn't know either. I ate the food that you made</font>

77
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:31,513
<font color="yellow">and just thought they tasted similar. I couldn't have dreamed that you made it.</font>

78
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,323
<font color="yellow"><i>Whose house is this?</i></font>

79
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:41,203
<font color="yellow"><i>The house of my boyfriend...or will be.</i></font>

80
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:45,583
<font color="yellow">By chance, is Ji Yong's aunt, Cha Si Ah, your girlfriend?</font>

81
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:51,083
<font color="yellow">What? No she's not. She's just my college classmate.</font>

82
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,263
<font color="yellow">Right? It's Cheong, right?</font>

83
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:59,743
<font color="yellow">Omo, look at how you smile. You like her that much?</font>

84
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:04,783
<font color="yellow">But... you're already living together?</font>

85
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,873
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have a suitable place to go because of her circumstances.</font>

86
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:15,753
<font color="yellow">Fate is such a strange thing. I've received helped from Cheong many times.</font>

87
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:21,753
<font color="yellow">She helped me when I got pick-pocketed, and she also saved me from getting hit by a car when I was walking while distracted.</font>

88
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:28,153
<font color="yellow">How did you almost get hit by a car? You and Cheong both, don't you think about getting out of the way of a car?</font>

89
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,623
<font color="yellow">Be careful. Please.</font>

90
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:32,803
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

91
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:38,313
<font color="yellow">But... how can you afford to live in such a nice house?</font>

92
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:42,263
<font color="yellow">I earned a lot of money. Although, this is a rental.</font>

93
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:45,713
<font color="yellow">I can at least get a place for us to live together in.</font>

94
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:51,483
<font color="yellow">So... stop working so hard and live with me.</font>

95
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,563
<font color="yellow">What kind of work do you do, Joon Jae?</font>

96
00:10:57,863 --> 00:11:01,603
<font color="yellow">Just... this and that.</font>

97
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:04,503
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

98
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:14,203

102
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:36,673
<font color="yellow">A wish should be made in your heart for it to come true. If you say it aloud, it won't come true.</font>

103
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:39,573
<font color="yellow">Really? Oh, what do I do?</font>

104
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:43,303
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It'll come true even if you say it aloud. Blow the candles out.</font>

105
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,523
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

107
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:58,923
<font color="yellow">There's another thing to congratulate. You and your mom found each other.</font>

108
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:19,833
<font color="yellow">Wait. That is... is there anyone else who needs to be congratulated?</font>

109
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:24,913
<font color="yellow">Me. I did get a hundred on my English vocabulary test.</font>

110
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:28,183
<font color="yellow">Oh, we should congratulate her. Let's blow it out one more time, huh?</font>

111
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:30,803
<font color="yellow">You're doing this because you think it's fun, right?</font>

112
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,313
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

113
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,643

121

133
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:55,043

139
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:17,783

140
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:21,073

141

00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,843
<font color="yellow">See that? We're friends.</font>

149
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:00,943
<font color="yellow">Hey, if you're friends with my mom, where does that leave me?</font>

150
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:05,143
<font color="yellow">Ah, this house is becoming more and more strange.</font>

151
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:11,293
<font color="yellow">Mother, you don't know how hard I searched for you.</font>

152
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:16,433
<font color="yellow">I've got all of your old addresses memorized, and I know all of your friends and relatives, too.</font>

153
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:21,423
<font color="yellow">I see. I was overseas for several years after the divorce</font>

154
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:25,863
<font color="yellow">and after going through all my savings and coming back, I've just been taking care of other people's households.</font>

155
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:29,233
<font color="yellow"><b>- So it would have been hard to find me.  - Aigoo...</b></font>

156
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,843
<font color="yellow">You must have been through a lot.</font>

157
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:35,153
<font color="yellow">Shall we toast in light of that?</font>

158
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:36,883
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

159
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:46,143
<font color="yellow">But Mother, since the emotional reunion has</font>

160
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,773
<font color="yellow">died down a little, could I ask you something?</font>

161
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,643
<font color="yellow">Yes. What is it?</font>

162
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:55,683
<font color="yellow">Do you by any chance know someone named Kang Ji Hyun?</font>

163
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:58,013
<font color="yellow">You went to the same high school.</font>

164
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:05,273
<font color="yellow"><b>- Kang... Ji Hyun?  - Yes.</b></font>

165
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:07,303
<font color="yellow">Is she someone you know?</font>

166
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:13,493
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking?</font>

167
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:15,603
<font color="yellow">Well... there was some issue,</font>

168
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:18,243
<font color="yellow">so we've been looking into Kang Ji Hyun.</font>

169
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:22,383
<font color="yellow">Her resident ID has been cancelled and there's no record of her at all.</font>

170
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:29,373
<font color="yellow">She is someone I know. Who I know all too well.</font>

171
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:31,743
<font color="yellow"><b>- Really?  - Yeah.</b></font>

172
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,823
<font color="yellow">You know her, too.</font>

173
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,263
<font color="yellow">I... know her?</font>

174
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:42,133
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, it's your stepmother.</font>

175
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:49,313
<font color="yellow">Huh? What?</font>

176
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,783
<font color="yellow">But... that's not her name.</font>

177
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:55,883
<font color="yellow">She told me she changed her name to Kang Seo Hee.</font>

178
00:16:55,883 --> 00:17:00,333
<font color="yellow">She changed her name? Then there would have been some kind of record left but there wasn't anything.</font>

179
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:07,413
<font color="yellow">I don't know about all that, but her name in school was Kang Ji Hyun. I'm sure of at least that much.</font>

180
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:12,353
<font color="yellow">Kang Ji Hyun was that woman?</font>

181
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:15,313
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's wrong?</font>

182
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:18,813
<font color="yellow"><b>- The thing is--  - No, it's nothing.</b></font>

183
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:23,053
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's wrong?</font>

184
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:27,813
<font color="yellow">Mother, do you know an escapee named Ma Dae Young?</font>

185
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,583
<font color="yellow">I think I've heard the name.</font>

186
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:34,663
<font color="yellow">You see, we've been trying to track Ma Dae Young.</font>

187
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:38,403
<font color="yellow">But Kang Ji Hyun seems to be a bit related to Ma Dae Young.</font>

188
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,973
<font color="yellow">Related how?</font>

189
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,733
<font color="yellow"><b>- That is---  - That's enough.</b></font>

190
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:51,593
<font color="yellow">It's nothing much. The detective we know was asking about it.</font>

191
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,043
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

192
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:12,663
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae's mother is i-inside, right?</font>

193
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:14,293
<font color="yellow">Probably.</font>

194
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:19,153
<font color="yellow">By any chance... did she say anything about... me?</font>

195
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:22,813
<font color="yellow"><b>- What kind of things?  - Never mind.</b></font>

196
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,353
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going in?</font>

197
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,213
<font color="yellow">Tae Ho, do you want to have a drink with me?</font>

198
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:31,993
<font color="yellow">I...don't want to drink with you, Noona.</font>

199
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,983
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's have a drink.</font>

200
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,713
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much you like me,</font>

201
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:46,553
<font color="yellow">but do you want me to make you dislike me altogether?</font>

202
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:53,683
<font color="yellow">I... knew that that ahjumma was Joon Jae's mother.</font>

203
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,213
<font color="yellow">So why didn't you say anything?</font>

204
00:18:57,213 --> 00:19:01,983
<font color="yellow">I... have been really awful to her.</font>

205
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:04,673
<font color="yellow">So we didn't get along at all.</font>

206
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:10,013
<font color="yellow">But then I found out. That she's his mother.</font>

207
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:15,643
<font color="yellow">So I tried to restore my relationship with her somehow and then tell him,</font>

208
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:19,213
<font color="yellow">but everything is all over now. Once he finds out,</font>

209
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:23,633
<font color="yellow">he won't even want to be friends with me, right? He'll tell me to get lost, right?</font>

210
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,903
<font color="yellow">I know that I'm a horrible bitch.</font>

211
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:32,093
<font color="yellow">How do you feel? After hearing this,</font>

212
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,583
<font color="yellow">any feelings you had for me disappeared completely, right?</font>

213
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,893
<font color="yellow">Be thankful.</font>

214
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:42,443
<font color="yellow">My wish is for my feelings for Joon Jae to disappear completely.</font>

215
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:45,203
<font color="yellow">But because I can't help it, it's made it so difficult for me.</font>

216
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:48,613
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you so that you won't suffer like me.</font>

217
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:54,273
<font color="yellow">Your ardent feelings for me, that love, I'm telling you to throw it away.</font>

218
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:05,663
<font color="yellow">Yes. Kang Ji Hyun, whom my mother knows, is my stepmother.</font>

219
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:10,783
<font color="yellow">If she is still related to Ma Dae Young...</font>

220
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:15,783
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that the reason Ma Dae Young has been after you could be because your stepmother instigated it?</font>

221
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:18,233
<font color="yellow">But why? Why would he try to kill you?</font>

222
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:23,323
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Heo Joon Jae bastard did something bad to annoy her.</font>

223
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,263
<font color="yellow"><i>Father's will and testament was notarized,</i></font>

224
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:32,263
<font color="yellow"><i>but he left almost all of his assets to me and mom.</i></font>

225
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:35,673
<font color="yellow">The first thing I can say is that it would be over inheritance.</font>

226
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:40,473
<font color="yellow">Inheritance? How much wealth could there be that she'd go that far to harm you?</font>

227
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:43,433
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

228
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:49,193
<font color="yellow"><i>Rascal. You're defrauding me again! Stop!</i></font>

229
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:51,553
<font color="yellow">You're going to get it. Is your father a Chaebol?</font>

230
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,293
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

231
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,293
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

232
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:02,933
<font color="yellow"><i>Is that important right now? Can't you subpoena him right away?</i></font>

233
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:06,523
<font color="yellow">We can't without any crucial proof.</font>

234
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:10,533
<font color="yellow">And that could alert her that we're suspecting her,</font>

235
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,333
<font color="yellow">so we have to careful until we find some proof.</font>

236
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,143
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, I have a sense about this. The puzzle is coming together.</font>

237
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,653
<font color="yellow">And we don't have time to wait either.</font>

238
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:18,843
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

239
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:23,913
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do it my way. I'm going to find proof and reveal everything as soon as possible.</font>

240
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:33,593
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, he was in the state of being able to breath on his own a little.</font>

241
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:38,043
<font color="yellow">It happened when he was using the breathing machine only as a support.</font>

242
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:40,543
<font color="yellow">So there was no fatal cardiac arrest.</font>

243
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:45,343
<font color="yellow">He nearly died once. How could something like this happen again?</font>

244
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:48,753
<font color="yellow">I don't know if he'll be able to live a normal life even if he wakes up...</font>

245
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:54,563
<font color="yellow">In this patient's case, he has diffuse axonal injury.</font>

246
00:21:54,563 --> 00:22:00,693
<font color="yellow">In cases like his, sometimes the patient can suddenly wake up from a coma.</font>

247
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:05,403
<font color="yellow">Since we don't know the exact process how injured brain gets recovered,</font>

248
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:09,593
<font color="yellow">we just call it a miracle.</font>

249
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:14,643
<font color="yellow">I hope for a miracle, Doctor.</font>

250
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:04,433
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Chi Hyeon?</font>

251
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,183
<font color="yellow">Is he my father?</font>

252
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,023
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young?</font>

253
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,593
<font color="yellow"><b>- Is he?  - Must I confirm it for you?</b></font>

254
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:19,683
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

255
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:24,403
<font color="yellow">I don't understand, Chi Hyeon.</font>

256
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,013
<font color="yellow">Without knowing anything, without doing anything,</font>

257
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:32,923
<font color="yellow">if you just sit and wait, I'll do everything for you, so why are you curious?</font>

258
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:35,713
<font color="yellow">The fact that I'm the son of someone like him...!</font>

259
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,063
<font color="yellow">I hate it so much...</font>

260
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:44,193
<font color="yellow">Because then... it makes me feel like a clump of dirty moss</font>

261
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:47,083
<font color="yellow">that can never go out into the sunlight...</font>

262
00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:54,743
<font color="yellow">Chi Hyeon...</font>

263
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,363
<font color="yellow">I used to have...</font>

264
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,573
<font color="yellow">a twin sister.</font>

265
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:09,713
<font color="yellow">We were born in the same hour, same day, and we were put in the same basket</font>

266
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:14,653
<font color="yellow">and thrown away at an orphanage. My sister</font>

267
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:19,613
<font color="yellow">got adopted to a really nice home but not me.</font>

268
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:22,553
<font color="yellow">A father who got violent whenever he drank</font>

269
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:29,963
<font color="yellow">and a pathetic mother... being dirt poor with no future in sight...</font>

270
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:38,163
<font color="yellow">even in that circumstance, there was still one thing that worked for me.</font>

271
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:44,093
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know.</i></font>

272
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:49,773
<font color="yellow"><i>Just... I thought my father was sleeping after drinking</i></font>

273
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:53,623
<font color="yellow"><i>but when I woke up in the morning...</i></font>

274
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:57,763
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't cry.</i></font>

275
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:02,363
<font color="yellow">Honey...</font>

276
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:07,973
<font color="yellow"><i>if you go like this, how am I supposed to live on my own?</i></font>

277
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:11,513
<font color="yellow"><i>Take me with you!</i></font>

278
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:23,563
<font color="yellow">People seemed to trust whatever a powerless person says...</font>

279
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:28,473
<font color="yellow">Coming this far while using that as my sole weapon,</font>

280
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:33,123
<font color="yellow">it was a long and difficult road.</font>

281
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:44,173
<font color="yellow">Chi Hyeon...</font>

282
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:51,813
<font color="yellow">I didn't want you to take a longer way around.</font>

283
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:57,483
<font color="yellow">Whether it's Ma Dae Young or Heo Il Joong, they're only just shortcuts.</font>

284
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:08,843
<font color="yellow">Just take that shortcut and go out into that sunlight.</font>

285
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:14,603
<font color="yellow">And go live as not a clump of moss but as a flower.</font>

286
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,933
<font color="yellow">That's all you have to do.</font>

287
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,893

<font color="yellow"><b>- Noona.  - Yeah.</b></font>

289
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:58,053

290
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:02,863
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, has it been sorted out?</font>

291
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:06,043
<font color="yellow"><b>- Yes, it has. - Already?</b></font>

292
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:09,773
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? That's good. I'm glad.</font>

293
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:12,983
<font color="yellow">So Noona, you should confess to Joon Jae Hyung properly, too.</font>

294
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:17,333
<font color="yellow">In this situation? How can I?</font>

295
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,303
<font color="yellow">What if I can never see him again?</font>

296
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:23,533
<font color="yellow">Is there any meaning in continuing to see him like this?</font>

297
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,173
<font color="yellow">I'll be going.</font>

298
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,843
<font color="yellow">What? How can he sort out his feelings so quickly?</font>

299
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:40,413
<font color="yellow">Well...that's good then.</font>

300
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:47,443
<font color="yellow">Yes, it happened that way. I'll come home after sleeping here overnight.</font>

301
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:51,483
<font color="yellow">Omo, so you met your son?</font>

302
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:54,833
<font color="yellow">What a dramatic reunion!</font>

303
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,043
<font color="yellow">Omo, so how did you find him?</font>

304
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,123
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

305
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:05,993
<font color="yellow"><b>- Tell me about that thing earlier.  - What?</b></font>

306
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:10,183
<font color="yellow">About what kind of relationship Heo Joon Jae's stepmother has with Ma Dae Young.</font>

307
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:11,933
<font color="yellow">Why are you curious about it?</font>

308
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:16,303
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young tried to hurt me and Heo Joon Jae both.</font>

309
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:22,163
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young had just one woman in his life and that is Kang Ji Hyun.</font>

310
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:25,623
<font color="yellow">And surrounding her are all mysterious deaths.</font>

311
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:31,973
<font color="yellow">And her adoptive family members all had suspicious myocardial infarction. Suicide, accident...</font>

312
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:37,233
<font color="yellow">After both of her husbands losing their vision, they died of illness and accident.</font>

313
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,863
<font color="yellow">You don't understand what I'm saying right now, do you?</font>

314
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:43,993
<font color="yellow">No, I understand everything. You know I watch the news diligently these days.</font>

315
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:47,783
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Kang Ji Hyun could have had a child,</font>

316
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:50,623
<font color="yellow">but we couldn't find anyone since there was no record.</font>

317
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:56,103
<font color="yellow">But if Kang Ji Hyun is Joon Jae's stepmother, then who is that, that kid, Heo Chi Hyeon,</font>

318
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:59,313
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae's step brother, could be the child.</font>

319
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:01,443
<font color="yellow">What's with your expression?</font>

320
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:07,403
<font color="yellow">Just that... I feel like Heo Joon Jae was very lonely...</font>

321
00:29:07,403 --> 00:29:09,423
<font color="yellow">Well, he could have been.</font>

322
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:13,823
<font color="yellow">But it could have been a blessing that he met me after running away from home.</font>

323
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:17,203
<font color="yellow">That household is really chilling somehow...</font>

324
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:20,293
<font color="yellow">If you find out anything else, make sure to tell me.</font>

325
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:28,083
<font color="yellow">What help would she be if she heard anything else from me?</font>

326
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:34,173
<font color="yellow">Ah... That day at this pool,</font>

327
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:37,503
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there was something.</font>

328
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,113
<font color="yellow"><i>Cry.</i></font>

329
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:45,703
<font color="yellow">Cry? Why did I ask her to cry?</font>

330
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:48,773
<font color="yellow">Ah... tears...</font>

331
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:52,083
<font color="yellow">Tears...?</font>

332
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:54,853
<font color="yellow">This is my room.</font>

333
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:57,463
<font color="yellow">Omo, it's cozy and pretty.</font>

334
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,613
<font color="yellow">Can I sleep here with you tonight?</font>

335
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,133
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

336
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,713
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

337
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:12,193
<font color="yellow"><i>To my beloved Fool, you went through so much to come and be beside me, and I'm thankful that you came.</i></font>

338
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:17,943
<font color="yellow"><i>From now on, I'll make it so that you only wear pretty shoes and walk on nice paths.</i></font>

339
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:33,813
<font color="yellow">Omo! Omo!</font>

340
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:42,033
<font color="yellow">Omo! You finally came to our house!</font>

341
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,143
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae gave them to you?</font>

342
00:30:50,113 --> 00:30:54,213
<font color="yellow">Because you're here like this next to Joon Jae,</font>

343
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:56,773
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful and I feel relieved.</font>

344
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:03,203
<font color="yellow">Me, too. I'm so thankful and relieved that you came to be with Heo Joon Jae, too.</font>

345
00:31:03,203 --> 00:31:09,003
<font color="yellow">But... if something happens and I'm not next to Heo Joon Jae anymore,</font>

346
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:12,553
<font color="yellow">please don't go anywhere and be with him, okay?</font>

347
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:16,673
<font color="yellow">Huh? Something like what?</font>

348
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:19,003
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying in case...</font>

349
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:43,933
<font color="yellow"><i>Heo Joon Jae, thank you for the presents.</i></font>

350
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:05,203
<font color="yellow"><i>Why are you still up?</i></font>

351
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:13,153
<font color="yellow"><i>It's my birthday today, but I didn't really get to see your face properly.</i></font>

352
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:16,073
<font color="yellow"><i>Open the door.</i></font>

353
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:21,813
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ Friends say I've changed a bit♬</i></font>

354
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:26,983
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ The style of clothes I wear and even the type of coffee I like♬</i></font>

355
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:32,683
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ It's not something which is fabricated.♬</i></font>

356
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:40,083
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ What's coming out sounds like you. ♬</i></font>

357
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:45,283
<font color="yellow"><i>Since you saw my face, go to sleep. Stop making noise.</i></font>

358
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:49,613
<font color="yellow"><i>When I watched TV, a kiss was a must on a birthday.</i></font>

359
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:52,453
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ Every day one by one♬</i></font>

360
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:54,363
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Why?</font>

361
00:32:54,363 --> 00:33:00,583
<font color="yellow"><i>Come here.</i></font>

362
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:07,883
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ I must still be filling up cautiously with you♬</i></font>

363
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:14,023
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ Look here even now I'm holding you♬</i></font>

364
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:20,133
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ Like in a dream, I'm embracing you.♬</i></font>

365
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,443
<font color="yellow">Are you going to give me a birthday kiss?</font>

366
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:25,793
<font color="yellow"><b>- What?  - I'm ready.</b></font>

367
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,153
<font color="yellow">Aigoo.</font>

368
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,623
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

369
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:39,813
<font color="yellow">Hey, Delinquent Mermaid, you were going on about romantic love and whatnot before,</font>

370
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:41,553
<font color="yellow">but you keep going towards the dirty kind.</font>

371
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:46,073
<font color="yellow">What do you mean dirty love? Over this? Are you kidding?</font>

372
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:50,553
<font color="yellow">I wanted to warn you before, too,</font>

373
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:53,443
<font color="yellow">but please don't think so much before falling asleep at night.</font>

374
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,053
<font color="yellow">It's so noisy for me!</font>

375
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:57,383
<font color="yellow">So shameful. Eavesdropping on my thoughts.</font>

376
00:33:57,383 --> 00:34:00,223
<font color="yellow">Who did that? I don't want to hear it either.</font>

377
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:03,183
<font color="yellow">You keep blabbering on and that's why I can hear you.</font>

378
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:07,403
<font color="yellow">I told you many times before, but I live in a house because I don't like floor to floor noise.</font>

379
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:11,203
<font color="yellow">Your blabbering from the floor above me is giving me insomnia!</font>

380
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:16,473
<font color="yellow">I get it Downstairs Mister. So did you ask me to see you to complain about noise?</font>

381
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:18,873
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

382
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,613
<font color="yellow">Then why?</font>

383
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:25,213
<font color="yellow">To do this.</font>

384
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:32,123
<font color="yellow">I have to check and see if your heart's beating well.</font>

385
00:34:32,953 --> 00:34:36,243
<font color="yellow">But... it doesn't seem to be beating that great.</font>

386
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,623
<font color="yellow">Really? I think it's beating just fine.</font>

387
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,253
<font color="yellow">Now it is.</font>

388
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:11,913
<font color="yellow">Oh, it shocked me so much that I couldn't even sleep.</font>

389
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:14,483
<font color="yellow">So did your son grow up well?</font>

390
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,413
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think so.</font>

391
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:24,043
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's a relief. Now you can hold his hand and just go live with him now.</font>

392
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,493
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

393
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:31,413
<font color="yellow">But Joon Jae should go back to his rightful place.</font>

394
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,653
<font color="yellow">Omo, where are you going in the middle of our talk?</font>

395
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,543
<font color="yellow">To make dinner...</font>

396
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:37,353
<font color="yellow">Oh, what do you mean? Never mind!</font>

397
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:41,713
<font color="yellow">Just order something today. Don't be like that and tell me more, Unnie.</font>

398
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:44,053
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

399
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,013
<font color="yellow">why don't we have some tea and have a conversation?</font>

400
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,323
<font color="yellow">Do you want some coffee maybe?</font>

401
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,493
<font color="yellow">Green plum tea.</font>

402
00:35:52,493 --> 00:35:58,323
<font color="yellow">Oh, that sounds good. Okay, green plum tea. Green plum...</font>

403
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,063
<font color="yellow">Unnie, where do we keep the plum extract?</font>

404
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:01,123
<font color="yellow">In the refrigerator on the second shelf.</font>

405
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:04,303
<font color="yellow">Ah, that's right. In the second shelf.</font>

406
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:07,203
<font color="yellow">Second shelf...</font>

407
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,343
<font color="yellow">No, not there. Inside.</font>

408
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,163
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

409
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:13,213
<font color="yellow"><b>- Shall I do it?  - No, no. I found it.</b></font>

410
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:16,603
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can't make it for you? Seriously.</font>

411
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:20,083
<font color="yellow">Oh, honey, you're home. I told you, right?</font>

412
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,203
<font color="yellow">She found her son.</font>

413
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:24,873
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Congratulations.</font>

414
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:28,163
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you so much.</font>

415
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:29,793
<font color="yellow">But...why did you...</font>

416
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:35,243
<font color="yellow">It's cold, and it's too hard on you to go to the market without a car.</font>

417
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:38,183
<font color="yellow">So since it's his free day, I asked him to go get grocery instead.</font>

418
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,653
<font color="yellow">Oh, seriously. That's too much for you to do.</font>

419
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:50,793
<font color="yellow">Why? Is it no good?</font>

420
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:57,813
<font color="yellow">Vegetables are a bit wilted...and there's too much fat on the meat...</font>

421
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:01,863
<font color="yellow">Seriously, I knew you would do this. Can't you shop well?!</font>

422
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:04,953
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I just took whatever they gave me.</font>

423
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:07,803
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's okay. It's understandable since you're a man.</font>

424
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:09,853
<font color="yellow">I'll go and try to exchange them.</font>

425
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,503
<font color="yellow">Seriously. You're making more work for Unnie!</font>

426
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:15,463
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

427
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,763
<font color="yellow">Seriously, I can't live.</font>

428
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:24,373
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

429
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:25,713
<font color="yellow">Ji Yong's aunt?</font>

430
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:29,313
<font color="yellow">Yes, c-come in.</font>

431
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:36,583
<font color="yellow">You knew all along, right? That Joon Jae's my son.</font>

432
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:42,033
<font color="yellow">That is, I was going to tell him...</font>

433
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:44,993
<font color="yellow">Are you going to tell Joon Jae?</font>

434
00:37:47,753 --> 00:37:54,333
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not. I heard that you've been a good friend to him.</font>

435
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:58,983
<font color="yellow">Thank you. From now on, too, please do the same.</font>

436
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:04,473
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll be sure to. Mother, thank you.</font>

437
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:09,323
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, Mother? Don't be like this and be how you were before.</font>

438
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,763
<font color="yellow">Then get some rest.</font>

439
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:22,733
<font color="yellow">She smiled when she talked to me, so why do I feel so uneasy?</font>

440
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:27,563
<font color="yellow">Did she just draw the line? Between Joon Jae and I?</font>

441
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:46,733
<font color="yellow">Where is father?</font>

442
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:50,343
<font color="yellow">Go on ahead.</font>

443
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,733
<font color="yellow">Is that the President's real son?</font>

444
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,473
<font color="yellow">Not sure. I think so.</font>

445
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:00,293
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

446
00:39:00,293 --> 00:39:01,443
<font color="yellow">Is he here at the company?</font>

447
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:04,583
<font color="yellow">I told you before. He went on a vacation with his friends.</font>

448
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,273
<font color="yellow">Really? To where?</font>

449
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:11,623
<font color="yellow">To get some rest, he went to Hawaii.</font>

450
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:18,913
<font color="yellow">Hawaii... He's been away for a while now. Because of food,</font>

451
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:22,563
<font color="yellow">he doesn't stay longer than a week abroad even for a very important business trip.</font>

452
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:27,423
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, what is it that you want to say?</font>

453
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:29,813
<font color="yellow">That I can't trust you.</font>

454
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:34,883
<font color="yellow">That I'm cancelling how I told you to be a dutiful son to father.</font>

455
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,303
<font color="yellow">We want to verify his flight records.</font>

456
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:59,673
<font color="yellow">His name is Heo Il Joon. His resident number is 58-110-</font>

457
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,973
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's not here. His travel records.</font>

458
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:07,583
<font color="yellow">Hawaii or wherever, he hasn't been out of the country for the past six months.</font>

459
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:11,163
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm certain he's in the country.</i></font>

<font color="yellow">Hyung,</font>

461
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:24,623

463
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,633

467
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,713
<font color="yellow">Yeah, well, it would be good if we could get in there and gather some evidence.</font>

468
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:50,493
<font color="yellow">But still, that Kang Seo Hee woman is frightening.</font>

<font color="yellow">What if we get caught and croak, too? Hello?</font>

470

<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

474
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:23,723
<font color="yellow">But then again, you know Heo Chi Hyeon, his stepbrother,</font>

475
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:27,103
<font color="yellow">and Joon Jae's mother is linked to Kang Seo Hee.</font>

476
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:32,323
<font color="yellow">But still, you can't. If Joon Jae find out, it'll be hell! How about if we do it without him knowing?</font>

477
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:38,883
<font color="yellow">What is it? What do you want help with?</font>

00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:44,833

<font color="yellow">About two hours?</font>

481
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:52,703

00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:09,073
<font color="yellow">What? Ahn Jin Joo gathered up everyone except me?</font>

<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping, Father?</font>

492
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:51,113
<font color="yellow">Yeah...I guess the medicine is too strong. I'm a little fuzzy...</font>

498
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,673
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

499
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:23,623
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm upset to. I told Joon Jae</font>

500
00:43:23,623 --> 00:43:28,863
<font color="yellow">many times that you're unwell, but he says we won't come.</font>

504
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:46,673
<font color="yellow">He's going around defrauding people. I was worried so when I looked into it, that's what he had been doing.</font>

545
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:52,543

<font color="yellow">over here, please. Let me explain.</font>

552
00:48:47,773 --> 00:48:51,443
<font color="yellow">The ant traps,</font>

553
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:09,193

554
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:12,083
<font color="yellow">Then we'll start fumigating.</font>

555
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,663
<font color="yellow">Ah, what is this? There's a sign of earwigs!</font>

556
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:33,903
<font color="yellow">You see that black thing? Do you see it?</font>

557
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:38,383
<font color="yellow">It's not dust but an earwig's excrement.</font>

558
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:43,843
<font color="yellow">Ah, no matter how much effort you make, you can't prevent them from coming into a house.</font>

570
00:51:40,383 --> 00:51:46,703
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even recognize your own son. To suffer into this state, you separated from my mom.</font>

574
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:08,653
<font color="yellow">Let me just go to the room for a second.</font>

578
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:25,533
<font color="yellow">Anywhere but this house.</font>

579
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:26,973
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but why?</font>

580
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:30,333
<font color="yellow">If you stay here any longer, we won't know what will happen to you.</font>

581
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:35,003
<font color="yellow">This is my house. What would happen to me in my own house?</font>

582
00:52:36,393 --> 00:52:44,343
<font color="yellow">Like what happened to Manager Nam, you, and everybody else...! It's the Stepmother's fault.</font>

583
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:50,713
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you entered into this house, but...</font>

584
00:52:50,713 --> 00:52:55,513
<font color="yellow">After coming back home after 10 years, all you can do is choose to slander your mother?</font>

585
00:52:55,513 --> 00:52:57,703
<font color="yellow">Who's my mother?</font>

586
00:52:57,703 --> 00:53:03,853
<font color="yellow">You probably wanted to tell me how my choice was wrong.</font>

587
00:53:03,853 --> 00:53:07,773
<font color="yellow">Yes, you chose wrong.</font>

588
00:53:07,773 --> 00:53:09,043
<font color="yellow">From the beginning to the end. Everything!</font>

589
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:12,043
<font color="yellow">Who are you to judge that?</font>

590
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:16,953
<font color="yellow">It's my choice! And it's my life! It's not wrong.</font>

591
00:53:16,953 --> 00:53:19,123
<font color="yellow">I was happy.</font>

592
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:23,893
<font color="yellow">Just because my eyesight is getting a bit dull,</font>

593
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:29,823
<font color="yellow">You want to tell me my choice and my life is a fail?</font>

594
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:35,253
<font color="yellow">This eye will get completely better after surgery.</font>

595
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,953
<font color="yellow">It's because my body's condition isn't good that I can't do surgery. If I just did surgery...!</font>

596
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:44,463
<font color="yellow">It seems you can't only see me who's standing in front of you.</font>

597
00:53:44,463 --> 00:53:47,493
<font color="yellow">You can't see anything.</font>

598
00:53:47,493 --> 00:53:51,273
<font color="yellow">You don't even seem to think about seeing</font>

599
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,543
<font color="yellow">where your life is going downhill.</font>

600
00:53:55,543 --> 00:53:59,003
<font color="yellow">Do you want to criticize your stepmother that much?</font>

601
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:07,263
<font color="yellow">You rascal. She's a kind woman who cleans your room and waits for you to come home.</font>

602
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:12,403
<font color="yellow">Living together for 17 years, she knows me the most.</font>

603
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:13,913
<font color="yellow">What would you know?!</font>

604
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:18,803
<font color="yellow">Kang Seo Hee's real name is Kang Ji Hyun. She was married twice,</font>

605
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:29,573
<font color="yellow">You being like this...</font>

606
00:54:29,573 --> 00:54:36,563
<font color="yellow">It would be really great if it was a coincidence, but all these situations are saying it's not.</font>

607
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:42,333
<font color="yellow">Where did you get such lies...?</font>

608
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,543
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to believe it, then don't believe it.</font>

609
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:50,033
<font color="yellow">But... I can't leave you alone like this.</font>

610
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:54,513
<font color="yellow">Even if by force, I have to take you with me.</font>

611
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:56,313
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

612
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:03,493
<font color="yellow">Let me go! He said you've been defrauding people!</font>

613
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:09,323
<font color="yellow">That's why you're doing this horrible thing to me now, you bastard!</font>

614
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:27,963
<font color="yellow">(I called) because it's weird with the loud noises from upstairs.</font>

615
00:55:27,963 --> 00:55:31,033
<font color="yellow">They said they word for a exterminator company but</font>

616
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:33,623
<font color="yellow">I do hear "Father" and things like that.</font>

617
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,673
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll head home right now.</font>

618
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:41,313
<font color="yellow">Don't let Father leave and if something happens, immediately report to the police.</font>

619
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:49,033
<font color="yellow">Is this why you asked to meet with me?</font>

620
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:53,603
<font color="yellow">It looks like Joon Jae is at home.</font>

621
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:58,173
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It seems I won't be driving you home. Goodbye.</font>

622
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:02,883
<font color="yellow">Your memory will all disappear and I'm sure you'll be arrested.</font>

623
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:09,283
<font color="yellow">Even though you can't remember anything,</font>

624
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:14,623
<font color="yellow">I will hope that you get a taste of hell for a very long time.</font>

625
00:58:52,793 --> 00:58:55,303
<font color="yellow"><i>She's a real mermaid.</i></font>

626
00:58:56,603 --> 00:58:58,803
<font color="yellow"><i>You have to kill her. Catch her!</i></font>

627
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:00,753
<font color="yellow"><i>Catch her!</i></font>

628
00:59:22,843 --> 00:59:29,803
<font color="yellow"><i>Subtitles brought to you by The Blue Sea @ Viki</i></font>

629
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:36,573
<font color="yellow"><i>The two live well.</i></font>

630
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:44,543
<font color="yellow"><i>They aren't hurting nor are they hurt. They bore many pretty babies and while raising them well,</i></font>

631
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:47,863
<font color="yellow"><i>they happily grew old together</i></font>

632
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:51,343
<font color="yellow"><i>for a very long time.</i></font>

633
00:59:52,613 --> 00:59:55,763
<font color="yellow">Lies.</font>

634
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:58,983
<font color="yellow"><i>♬My nameless love ♬</i></font>

635
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:04,573
<font color="yellow">It was all lies again.</font>

636
01:00:04,573 --> 01:00:08,943
<font color="yellow"><i>♬ Before I knew you ♬</i></font>

637

641
01:00:33,653 --> 01:00:35,393
<font color="yellow"><i>Please leave me.</i></font>

642
01:00:35,393 --> 01:00:38,683
<font color="yellow"><i>I like you a lot. Not as a friend but as a man.</i></font>
