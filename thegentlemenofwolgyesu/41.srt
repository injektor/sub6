00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:21,363
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, it's the end for both of us.</font>

158
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:24,993
<font color="yellow">- Okay. You can talk with me, Mum. - My goodness.</font>

159
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:27,733
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

160
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:33,263
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

161
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:35,263
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Mum.</font>

162
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:39,293
<font color="yellow">What happened, Hyo Won?</font>

163
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,393
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

164
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:43,693
<font color="yellow">Mum seems to have a little misunderstanding.</font>

165
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:46,193
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it. Good night, Tae Yang.</font>

166
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,463
<font color="yellow">I mind a lot.</font>

167
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,423
<font color="yellow">Don't say a word. Get married by this month.</font>

168
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:58,163
<font color="yellow">Honey, it's cold. Get inside and I'll call you later.</font>

169
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:02,993
<font color="yellow">As long as I'm alive,</font>

170
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,393
<font color="yellow">you can't do anything funny.</font>

171
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,423
<font color="yellow">Mum, buckle up.</font>

172
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,223
<font color="yellow">Honey, get inside.</font>

173
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,563
<font color="yellow">Why is she doing that?</font>

174
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,663
<font color="yellow">She said we should never get married.</font>

175
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,993
<font color="yellow">Why is she telling us to get married?</font>

176
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,493
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

177
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:40,793
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

178
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:42,493
<font color="yellow">We need to talk, Mum.</font>

179
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:44,363
<font color="yellow">What do we have to talk about?</font>

180
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:46,393
<font color="yellow">They say every evil doer has his reasons.</font>

181
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:50,693
<font color="yellow">How can you back-stab me like this?</font>

182
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:54,593
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

183
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,493
<font color="yellow">What happened? Are you crying?</font>

184
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:00,663
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

185
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,493
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on? Why are you crying, Mum?</font>

186
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,223
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

187
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:12,623
<font color="yellow">What happened to Mum?</font>

188
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:15,893
<font color="yellow">- Did you make a trouble again? - Not me, you did.</font>

189
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:17,923
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - You want to marry Pooper.</font>

190
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,023
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a trouble?</font>

191
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:21,923
<font color="yellow">Why do you call her Popper when she has a decent name?</font>

192
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,023
<font color="yellow">She will be your family. What a nerve!</font>

193
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,423
<font color="yellow">She won't be my family.</font>

194
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,493
<font color="yellow">You can't marry her.</font>

195
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:35,263
<font color="yellow">There's nothing special about Kang Tae Yang.</font>

196
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:37,693
<font color="yellow">She must be out of her mind.</font>

197
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:44,893
<font color="yellow">Will.</font>

198
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,723
<font color="yellow">I,</font>

199
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:51,963
<font color="yellow">Bok Sun Nyeo,</font>

200
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:54,963
<font color="yellow">is near...</font>

201
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:00,623
<font color="yellow">death.</font>

202
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:03,693
<font color="yellow">Before I die,</font>

203
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:07,993
<font color="yellow">I pass along...</font>

204
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:11,363
<font color="yellow">several requests...</font>

205
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,063
<font color="yellow">to my husband, Bae Sam Do.</font>

206
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:24,893
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

207
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:27,593
<font color="yellow">on my last moments,</font>

208
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:31,963
<font color="yellow">Bae Sam Do...</font>

209
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,063
<font color="yellow">should hold my hands...</font>

210
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,363
<font color="yellow">and kiss on my forehead.</font>

211
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:48,893
<font color="yellow">Second,</font>

212
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:53,823
<font color="yellow">at the same time,</font>

213
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:55,863
<font color="yellow">he should whisper...</font>

214
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,093
<font color="yellow">(Second, at the same time...)</font>

215
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,393
<font color="yellow">in my ear...</font>

216
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:07,993
<font color="yellow">that he loves me.</font>

217
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,593
<font color="yellow">(He should whisper in my ear that he loves me.)</font>

218
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:17,063
<font color="yellow">Poor Sam Do.</font>

219
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,363
<font color="yellow">Poor thing.</font>

220
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:34,893
<font color="yellow">You came home late.</font>

221
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,363
<font color="yellow">I had a lot of orders.</font>

222
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,263
<font color="yellow">Change your cloths. I'll set the table.</font>

223
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:42,323
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute, honey.</font>

224
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,123
<font color="yellow">Do you need to tell me something?</font>

225
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:48,893
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

226
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,163
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - Divorce paper.</font>

227
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:52,893
<font color="yellow">Divorce paper?</font>

228
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,393
<font color="yellow">You told me yesterday that you would stamp on it if I bring it.</font>

229
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:58,593
<font color="yellow">- What? - I already put my stamp on it.</font>

230
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,063
<font color="yellow">You are a jerk!</font>

231
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,193
<font color="yellow">Why do you hit me?</font>

232
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,293
<font color="yellow">You told me you would stamp on it if I bring the divorce paper.</font>

233
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,223
<font color="yellow">Did you really have to bring it?</font>

234
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,123
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

235
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,593
<font color="yellow">You keep two tongues in one mouth. You told me you would stamp on it!</font>

236
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:16,123
<font color="yellow">You'd rather wish me dead.</font>

237
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:19,593
<font color="yellow">You won't take the trouble to go to the court if I die.</font>

238
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:21,993
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Who's going to die?</font>

239
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:24,563
<font color="yellow">You suggested divorce first.</font>

240
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,593
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking on me?</font>

241
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,093
<font color="yellow">What's this fuss about?</font>

242
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:35,493
<font color="yellow">I was going to leave you...</font>

243
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:38,493
<font color="yellow">even without this kind of paper.</font>

244
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,193
<font color="yellow">How can you bring this?</font>

245
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,793
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you just wait any longer?</font>

246
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,663
<font color="yellow">Are you that sick and tired of me, Bae Sam Do?</font>

247
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:47,723
<font color="yellow">What on earth did I do wrong...</font>

248
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,623
<font color="yellow">to you?</font>

249
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:53,063
<font color="yellow">- Calm down, Sun Nyeo. - Right. I'm sick of you.</font>

250
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:54,663
<font color="yellow">A day feels like an eternity for me.</font>

251
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:57,893
<font color="yellow">Now that you suggested divorce, I brought the paper cheerfully.</font>

252
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:59,423
<font color="yellow">I'm so sick of you when you're acting like this.</font>

253
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,763
<font color="yellow">- I'm so tired of you. - Calm down, Sam Do.</font>

254
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,023
<font color="yellow">This is not like you.</font>

255
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:06,223
<font color="yellow">She always change her words. I'm so sick of that.</font>

256
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,663
<font color="yellow">Sam Do, calm down and get inside. We need to talk.</font>

257
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,363
<font color="yellow">Let's get in. Let's go.</font>

258
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,493
<font color="yellow">Get inside now.</font>

259
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,793
<font color="yellow">Why do yo say something you don't want to?</font>

260
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,223
<font color="yellow">You don't want to divorce him.</font>

261
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,863
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I want.</font>

262
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:28,793
<font color="yellow">I feel pity for him,</font>

263
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:33,423
<font color="yellow">Bae Sam Do.</font>

264
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:34,723
<font color="yellow">And I sometimes hate him.</font>

265
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:38,563
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I feel.</font>

266
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,263
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Sun Nyeo. Calm down.</font>

267
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:50,763
<font color="yellow">You don't really want to divorce Sun Nyeo, do you?</font>

268
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,463
<font color="yellow">I don't really want to divorce her,</font>

269
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,023
<font color="yellow">but this kind of opportunity doesn't come every day.</font>

270
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:56,623
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to get her stamp on the paper to cure her of the habit.</font>

271
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,593
<font color="yellow">You're so innocent.</font>

272
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,123
<font color="yellow">Do you think she really means it?</font>

273
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:01,723
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

274
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,763
<font color="yellow">Why does she get me all riled up...</font>

275
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,193
<font color="yellow">when she doesn't want to divorce me?</font>

276
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:06,693
<font color="yellow">You're right about that.</font>

277
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,493
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did she suggest divorce all of a sudden?</font>

278
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:13,963
<font color="yellow">She's trying to pick on me.</font>

279
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:16,123
<font color="yellow">My goodness. She's like a bull dog.</font>

280
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,963
<font color="yellow">(Hwa Seong Hospital)</font>

281
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:32,623
<font color="yellow">You went to so much trouble.</font>

282
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:34,393
<font color="yellow">You're all right now.</font>

283
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:39,123
<font color="yellow">You're in the hospital. Don't you remember?</font>

284
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:42,223
<font color="yellow">A fire was set on your room. It might have been a disaster.</font>

285
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,823
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

286
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,933
<font color="yellow">- Yun Shil. - I told you to never find me again.</font>

287
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:57,893
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

288
00:17:58,263 --> 00:17:59,323
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

289
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,093
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't have been sick.</font>

290
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,963
<font color="yellow">I turned away since you told me you were in a trouble because of me.</font>

291
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:09,193
<font color="yellow">Then you should have been good by yourself.</font>

292
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,433
<font color="yellow">How can I leave you...</font>

293
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,563
<font color="yellow">if you got sick like this?</font>

294
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:15,163
<font color="yellow">I just got a cold.</font>

295
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,663
<font color="yellow">I just lost my consciousness due to a fire.</font>

296
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:20,763
<font color="yellow">- It was just an accident. - No.</font>

297
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:24,723
<font color="yellow">You didn't want to break up with me, but you tried to push me away.</font>

298
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,223
<font color="yellow">That's why you got sick.</font>

299
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:32,063
<font color="yellow">I gave up my feelings for you.</font>

300
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:33,663
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

301
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,463
<font color="yellow">I can't give you up...</font>

302
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,563
<font color="yellow">and I don't want to give you up.</font>

303
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,993
<font color="yellow">Don't be unreasonable and go back.</font>

304
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:44,823
<font color="yellow">You should stay calm.</font>

305
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,093
<font color="yellow">We can talk about it later. Lie down.</font>

306
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:51,293
<font color="yellow">Get out of the way. If you don't leave, I'll leave.</font>

307
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:52,563
<font color="yellow">Please!</font>

308
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,493
<font color="yellow">Lie down if you don't want to collapse again.</font>

309
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,123
<font color="yellow">I'd rather collapse...</font>

310
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:03,193
<font color="yellow">and never wake up again.</font>

311
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:06,823
<font color="yellow">However I try to hide, you find me.</font>

312
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:09,263
<font color="yellow">I don't even know where to hide any more.</font>

313
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,193
<font color="yellow">I'm exhausted.</font>

314
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:13,433
<font color="yellow">Don't be exhausted alone.</font>

315
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:15,093
<font color="yellow">I'll be beside you.</font>

316
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:17,493
<font color="yellow">You make me exhausted.</font>

317
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,593
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to tell you?</font>

318
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,123
<font color="yellow">It's over between us.</font>

319
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,693
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you again,</font>

320
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,263
<font color="yellow">so don't tear me up like this.</font>

321
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:31,093
<font color="yellow">What shall I do...</font>

322
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:33,363
<font color="yellow">if being worried...</font>

323
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:35,693
<font color="yellow">and heartbroken...</font>

324
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,723
<font color="yellow">to see you sick...</font>

325
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,823
<font color="yellow">makes you feel like that?</font>

326
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,693
<font color="yellow">Did you even love me?</font>

327
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,933
<font color="yellow">Why does that matter now?</font>

328
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,763
<font color="yellow">Please, just go.</font>

329
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:57,563
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

330
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,193
<font color="yellow">If you hate my being here so much, I'll have to go.</font>

331
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:02,963
<font color="yellow">I'll go.</font>

332
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,263
<font color="yellow">You feel sick...</font>

333
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,493
<font color="yellow">because of me?</font>

334
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:01,993
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

335
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:05,293
<font color="yellow">You should be in the hospital.</font>

336
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:07,463
<font color="yellow">Why were you drinking?</font>

337
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,593
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mother.</font>

338
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:12,823
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I think I'm drunk.</font>

339
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,763
<font color="yellow">Get it together and tell me.</font>

340
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:18,223
<font color="yellow">What did you do with Yun Shil? Why did you drink so much?</font>

341
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:21,463
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil? Na Yun Shil...</font>

342
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:24,193
<font color="yellow">She's in the hospital.</font>

343
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:26,123
<font color="yellow">You left her there alone and drank?</font>

344
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:28,593
<font color="yellow">Yes. She kept...</font>

345
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,023
<font color="yellow">telling me to leave.</font>

346
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,623
<font color="yellow">She said you'd be upset if I stayed in the hospital.</font>

347
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:39,563
<font color="yellow">She kept telling me to leave, or she'd leave the hospital.</font>

348
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:43,093
<font color="yellow">So I had no choice but to come home.</font>

349
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,723
<font color="yellow">She is impossible.</font>

350
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,623
<font color="yellow">She is a total fool.</font>

351
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:54,393
<font color="yellow">Why is my gentlemanly brother-in-law so drunk?</font>

352
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,393
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

353
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,223
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is hurt and in the hospital,</font>

354
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,163
<font color="yellow">but I left her there alone.</font>

355
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:03,623
<font color="yellow">I had no choice but to leave her there...</font>

356
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:07,223
<font color="yellow">and it just hurt too much.</font>

357
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,923
<font color="yellow">I thought it would help if I got drunk, but it was no use.</font>

358
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,563
<font color="yellow">It didn't help at all.</font>

359
00:22:15,623 --> 00:22:18,763
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go in. You're drunk. You drank a lot.</font>

360
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,693
<font color="yellow">I'll help you. Come on.</font>

361
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:21,963
<font color="yellow">Good night, Mother.</font>

362
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:28,293
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

363
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,663
<font color="yellow">I've sinned too much.</font>

364
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:36,593
<font color="yellow">Come in. Here.</font>

365
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:40,893
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

366
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,823
<font color="yellow">No. I'm fine.</font>

367
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:46,323
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk.</font>

368
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:49,063
<font color="yellow">Drunk people always say they aren't drunk.</font>

369
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:53,323
<font color="yellow">Fine. You're not drunk. You're not. So let's lie down.</font>

370
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:59,623
<font color="yellow">Sung Jun. Why is life...</font>

371
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:03,493
<font color="yellow">so exhausting?</font>

372
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:05,423
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

373
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,293
<font color="yellow">no energy any more.</font>

374
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:11,723
<font color="yellow">I'm so exhausted now.</font>

375
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,023
<font color="yellow">He's having such a hard time.</font>

376
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:41,593
<font color="yellow">Let's give them our blessing.</font>

377
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:46,593
<font color="yellow">I feel like I should give in and not make my son cry,</font>

378
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:49,923
<font color="yellow">but then again,</font>

379
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:51,763
<font color="yellow">it's just too much.</font>

380
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,463
<font color="yellow">Once that thug gets released from prison,</font>

381
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:58,593
<font color="yellow">poor Dong Jin will suffer. It's clear as day.</font>

382
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:00,923
<font color="yellow">Don't think only about Dong Jin,</font>

383
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:05,423
<font color="yellow">but Yun Shil, too, whom we considered our daughter.</font>

384
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:09,823
<font color="yellow">We can't make decisions out of fear.</font>

385
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,193
<font color="yellow">Must our precious son...</font>

386
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:15,993
<font color="yellow">live with so much pain because of that thug?</font>

387
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,163
<font color="yellow">Did you even love me?</font>

388
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:37,563
<font color="yellow">Why does that matter now?</font>

389
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,923
<font color="yellow">Please, just go.</font>

390
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:45,623
<font color="yellow">Fine. If you hate my being here so much, I'll have to go.</font>

391
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,263
<font color="yellow">I'll go.</font>

392
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,323
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dong Jin.</font>

393
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:08,223
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, are you still sleeping?</font>

394
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,693
<font color="yellow">No, Mother. I'm up.</font>

395
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,393
<font color="yellow">Have some honey water.</font>

396
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:21,193
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

397
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:29,493
<font color="yellow">I know you're upset, but why did you drink so much?</font>

398
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,193
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

399
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:33,123
<font color="yellow">Get it together and lead the way.</font>

400
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:35,823
<font color="yellow">Lead the way? To where?</font>

401
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:39,263
<font color="yellow">Where else? To the hospital where Yun Shil is.</font>

402
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,123
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

403
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:54,623
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving without having breakfast?</font>

404
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:59,123
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about last night.</font>

405
00:25:59,623 --> 00:26:00,963
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

406
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,993
<font color="yellow">You can't fool me twice.</font>

407
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:06,023
<font color="yellow">You'll apologize and then stab me in the back again.</font>

408
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,223
<font color="yellow">I won't fall for it.</font>

409
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:14,823
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm not ready yet.</font>

410
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:18,763
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing it to hurt you, so please understand.</font>

411
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:20,363
<font color="yellow">Ready for what?</font>

412
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:23,763
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later. I'll tell you everything later.</font>

413
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:32,763
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

414
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:34,823
<font color="yellow">What else? Spend it for today.</font>

415
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,093
<font color="yellow">This is for today? For one day?</font>

416
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:40,923
<font color="yellow">It's 50 dollars.</font>

417
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,663
<font color="yellow">That's a 10 times increase.</font>

418
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:45,723
<font color="yellow">You need days like this, too.</font>

419
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:50,363
<font color="yellow">Use this to have a good lunch...</font>

420
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:53,663
<font color="yellow">and have some nice tea, okay?</font>

421
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:02,123
<font color="yellow">She keeps flip-flopping several times a day.</font>

422
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:04,893
<font color="yellow">What has gotten into her?</font>

423
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:19,723
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about Yun Shil?</font>

424
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:23,323
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook says she woke up, so she should be fine.</font>

425
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:27,763
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness Mr Lee went right at that time.</font>

426
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,963
<font color="yellow">I know. He saved her life.</font>

427
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,193
<font color="yellow">Is anyone in?</font>

428
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:36,463
<font color="yellow">Why is she here so early in the morning?</font>

429
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:37,563
<font color="yellow">Where's the boss?</font>

430
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:41,093
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business where our boss is.</font>

431
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,193
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

432
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,423
<font color="yellow">Where did you hide my daughter-in-law? Spill it.</font>

433
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:48,423
<font color="yellow">I told you already.</font>

434
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:50,863
<font color="yellow">We're going crazy trying to find her ourselves.</font>

435
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:54,023
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo's boys can find her in half a day.</font>

436
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,163
<font color="yellow">If you're hiding her somewhere,</font>

437
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:59,293
<font color="yellow">my son will kill all of you.</font>

438
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:02,323
<font color="yellow">If you can find her in half a day, why are you annoyingly asking us?</font>

439
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:04,323
<font color="yellow">My sentiments exactly.</font>

440
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:06,363
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

441
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,623
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

442
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:24,793
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee and Ms Choi. How are you...</font>

443
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:30,193
<font color="yellow">You poor thing. You must have been so shocked.</font>

444
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:32,893
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness it isn't worse.</font>

445
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,463
<font color="yellow">We were so shocked when we heard.</font>

446
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,623
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for worrying you.</font>

447
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:41,263
<font color="yellow">I know you're trying hard to keep your promise to me,</font>

448
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:42,793
<font color="yellow">so don't be sorry.</font>

449
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:48,893
<font color="yellow">I only said it with my mouth that you were my daughter,</font>

450
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,263
<font color="yellow">and was terrible to you. I'm sorry, Yun Shil.</font>

451
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,723
<font color="yellow">What is Dong Jin doing outside?</font>

452
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:56,823
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

453
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,693
<font color="yellow">Are you offering your food to the dead or something?</font>

454
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,493
<font color="yellow">Why are you just staring at it?</font>

455
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:12,093
<font color="yellow">Go on and eat.</font>

456
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,723
<font color="yellow">Stop crying.</font>

457
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:18,493
<font color="yellow">It'll tire you out. Eat.</font>

458
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:24,763
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

459
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:32,423
<font color="yellow">You'll get sick. Chew well.</font>

460
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:43,123
<font color="yellow">You need to get better so that you can come home,</font>

461
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:46,223
<font color="yellow">and you need to eat so that you can get better.</font>

462
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:48,293
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

463
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,163
<font color="yellow">Do you mean...</font>

464
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,863
<font color="yellow">I think your mother means...</font>

465
00:29:52,863 --> 00:29:57,763
<font color="yellow">she'll let the two of you date or something like that.</font>

466
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:58,993
<font color="yellow">Right, honey?</font>

467
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:02,223
<font color="yellow">When you come home,</font>

468
00:30:02,723 --> 00:30:05,363
<font color="yellow">I'll make you cabbage pancakes, which you like.</font>

469
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:07,063
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

470
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:09,993
<font color="yellow">You feed her the rest.</font>

471
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:14,223
<font color="yellow">She keeps crying because I'm here.</font>

472
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:18,063
<font color="yellow">Yes. We should bow out.</font>

473
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:22,663
<font color="yellow">I'll clean your room, so get better and come home.</font>

474
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,823
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

475
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,093
<font color="yellow">Sure. You take good care of her.</font>

476
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,923
<font color="yellow">I will. Thank you, Father.</font>

477
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:34,223
<font color="yellow">I came because your mother wanted to. Don't thank me.</font>

478
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:36,593
<font color="yellow">We're going.</font>

479
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:37,963
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

480
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:45,923
<font color="yellow">I'll go see them out.</font>

481
00:31:04,723 --> 00:31:06,823
<font color="yellow">What could Hyo Won's mother want now?</font>

482
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:11,963
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mother.</font>

483
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,023
<font color="yellow">Come to the wedding dress shop right now.</font>

484
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:16,493
<font color="yellow">Wedding dress?</font>

485
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,393
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

486
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,463
<font color="yellow">Hi, darling.</font>

487
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:33,563
<font color="yellow">Hi. Why are we here?</font>

488
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:36,423
<font color="yellow">She's trying on wedding dresses at a wedding dress shop.</font>

489
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:38,563
<font color="yellow">Do you think she's here to buy candy?</font>

490
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,593
<font color="yellow">I understand,</font>

491
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:41,923
<font color="yellow">but why a wedding dress?</font>

492
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:45,323
<font color="yellow">She needs a wedding dress before the wedding.</font>

493
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:48,223
<font color="yellow">Don't look at her.</font>

494
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:50,863
<font color="yellow">She wants to get married later, but I insisted.</font>

495
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:53,493
<font color="yellow">- Mother, I... - Stop talking.</font>

496
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,463
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, try on the dresses.</font>

497
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:57,223
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, try on the tuxedos.</font>

498
00:31:57,563 --> 00:31:58,593
<font color="yellow">Now!</font>

499
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:01,793
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

500
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:06,663
<font color="yellow">I just don't get it.</font>

501
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,623
<font color="yellow">Why is she suddenly insisting...</font>

502
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,823
<font color="yellow">on marrying Hyo Won and Tae Yang?</font>

503
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,723
<font color="yellow">Do you think Mother...</font>

504
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,123
<font color="yellow">found out about Tae Yang and my past...</font>

505
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:17,693
<font color="yellow">Definitely not.</font>

506
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:19,463
<font color="yellow">With her temper, if she found out,</font>

507
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:21,663
<font color="yellow">she would have blown a fuse over and over.</font>

508
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:23,493
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't let it slide like this.</font>

509
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,463
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

510
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:28,793
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to her.</font>

511
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,823
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Hi, Mum. Where are you?</font>

512
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:36,463
<font color="yellow">At a wedding dress shop.</font>

513
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,423
<font color="yellow">A wedding dress shop?</font>

514
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:40,393
<font color="yellow">Why did you go there? Why?</font>

515
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:27,723
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

516
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,463
<font color="yellow">Not bad.</font>

517
00:35:30,223 --> 00:35:31,263
<font color="yellow">Ms Lee.</font>

518
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:33,423
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything else?</font>

519
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:37,393
<font color="yellow">- Something more feminine. - My goodness.</font>

520
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:40,223
<font color="yellow">How many times will you make me change?</font>

521
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:43,193
<font color="yellow">And I told you, we decided not to get married.</font>

522
00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:47,193
<font color="yellow">That's right. We decided to get married once I've saved up enough.</font>

523
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:48,263
<font color="yellow">Ms Lee.</font>

524
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,063
<font color="yellow">Please excuse us.</font>

525
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:51,493
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

526
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,063
<font color="yellow">When will you save up enough?</font>

527
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,293
<font color="yellow">- I have my part time job and... - How can you support...</font>

528
00:36:16,663 --> 00:36:18,663
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won and the baby...</font>

529
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,333
<font color="yellow">with your part time job?</font>

530
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,423
<font color="yellow">What baby?</font>

531
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:26,863
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

532
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:29,423
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

533
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:32,723
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

534
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:35,723
<font color="yellow">- Darling. - Why are you sorry?</font>

535
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,423
<font color="yellow">He should be sorry for spreading his seed when he has no money!</font>

536
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:40,833
<font color="yellow">I've never done that, Mother.</font>

537
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:44,163
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, you've never done that?</font>

538
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:48,263
<font color="yellow">I totally misjudged you. You are utterly irresponsible!</font>

539
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,693
<font color="yellow">How could you play dumb?</font>

540
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:57,423
<font color="yellow">I wanted to marry Tae Yang as soon as possible,</font>

541
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,693
<font color="yellow">so I told a teensy-bitsy lie.</font>

542
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:04,123
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

543
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:07,863
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

544
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:09,463
<font color="yellow">- Please, calm down. - Of all the lies!</font>

545
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,333
<font color="yellow">How could you lie about that?</font>

546
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,993
<font color="yellow">- Darling, are you all right? - Are you out of your mind?</font>

547
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:16,293
<font color="yellow">Mum. What's wrong?</font>

548
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:17,293
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

549
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:20,093
<font color="yellow">That freak-show.</font>

550
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:22,163
<font color="yellow">See? What did I say?</font>

551
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:24,363
<font color="yellow">I told you Tae Yang is a total doofus.</font>

552
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:28,023
<font color="yellow">Not Tae Yang. Hyo Won!</font>

553
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,363
<font color="yellow">She wanted to marry him so much...</font>

554
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:34,123
<font color="yellow">that she lied about being pregnant.</font>

555
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:35,723
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

556
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:38,493
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

557
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,423
<font color="yellow">I overdid it slightly.</font>

558
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,193
<font color="yellow">Overdid it slightly?</font>

559
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,463
<font color="yellow">- Please don't hit her. - Mum!</font>

560
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,093
<font color="yellow">You stay out of it, punk!</font>

561
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:49,063
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep grabbing him by his collar?</font>

562
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:50,193
<font color="yellow">Let go of him!</font>

563
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:00,123
<font color="yellow">- Tae Yang. - Are you okay?</font>

564
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:02,593
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to your brother?</font>

565
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,063
<font color="yellow">Did you just yell at me?</font>

566
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:05,493
<font color="yellow">How dare you yell at her?</font>

567
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,093
<font color="yellow">- I'll do the same! - I'll grab her by her collar...</font>

568
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:09,623
<font color="yellow">so that she comes to her senses!</font>

569
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,263
<font color="yellow">- Why you... - Let go!</font>

570
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,833
<font color="yellow">How dare you...</font>

571
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,663
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy!</font>

572
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:19,423
<font color="yellow">Everyone freeze!</font>

573
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,193
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat enough.</font>

574
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:38,723
<font color="yellow">The doctor said you need to eat and sleep well in order to recover.</font>

575
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,123
<font color="yellow">I've thought about it, and this isn't right.</font>

576
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,363
<font color="yellow">So please, go home.</font>

577
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,663
<font color="yellow">There you go again. Didn't you hear my mother?</font>

578
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:51,723
<font color="yellow">She said that because I'm hurt and she feels sorry for me.</font>

579
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,493
<font color="yellow">I can't be shameless and pretend she meant it.</font>

580
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:56,963
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

581
00:38:57,563 --> 00:39:00,493
<font color="yellow">my mother said things she didn't mean, just to look good?</font>

582
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,493
<font color="yellow">- That's not it... - Exactly.</font>

583
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:07,593
<font color="yellow">My mother was genuinely worried about you and told you to come back.</font>

584
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:11,163
<font color="yellow">If you refuse, you're the bad person here.</font>

585
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:13,393
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I don't want to do it.</font>

586
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,463
<font color="yellow">I just don't think I should.</font>

587
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:18,833
<font color="yellow">So you should go home for now.</font>

588
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:21,423
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself.</font>

589
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:25,793
<font color="yellow">Do you really...</font>

590
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,923
<font color="yellow">want me to be a loser who gets angry at someone who isn't well?</font>

591
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,023
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

592
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:35,593
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying things you don't mean? It isn't like you.</font>

593
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:40,363
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

594
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:50,963
<font color="yellow">You're finally awake.</font>

595
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,423
<font color="yellow">So, are you okay?</font>

596
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,263
<font color="yellow">You must have been worried.</font>

597
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:56,723
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

598
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:01,393
<font color="yellow">Why? It's not like you did it on purpose.</font>

599
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:04,093
<font color="yellow">You were just unlucky that happened.</font>

600
00:40:05,223 --> 00:40:08,693
<font color="yellow">Plus, your husband paid for the repairs,</font>

601
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,493
<font color="yellow">so I'm thankful.</font>

602
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:12,193
<font color="yellow">The repairs?</font>

603
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:17,663
<font color="yellow">It's because your husband ran over right in the nick of time,</font>

604
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:20,193
<font color="yellow">that he put out the fire and you weren't more injured.</font>

605
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:23,563
<font color="yellow">It could have been really dangerous.</font>

606
00:40:25,263 --> 00:40:27,363
<font color="yellow">But she doesn't remember any of it...</font>

607
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,223
<font color="yellow">and keeps scolding me.</font>

608
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:32,793
<font color="yellow">Why are you scolding him?</font>

609
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:35,263
<font color="yellow">You should be singing his praise.</font>

610
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:38,793
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

611
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:42,423
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil, I brought all of your things.</font>

612
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:45,833
<font color="yellow">Once you're recovered, go to Seoul with your husband.</font>

613
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:47,793
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

614
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:50,593
<font color="yellow">Just because you had...</font>

615
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,893
<font color="yellow">a little fight, you shouldn't...</font>

616
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:55,023
<font color="yellow">pack your bags and move out.</font>

617
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,333
<font color="yellow">It'll become a habit.</font>

618
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:59,893
<font color="yellow">I should have treated my wife better.</font>

619
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:02,993
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You are handsome,</font>

620
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,833
<font color="yellow">and sweet, too.</font>

621
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:07,763
<font color="yellow">You'll never find another man like him.</font>

622
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:11,763
<font color="yellow">If my husband were just a tiny bit like him...</font>

623
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:14,293
<font color="yellow">I'd carry him around all over the place.</font>

624
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:16,493
<font color="yellow">Get well soon and carry me around.</font>

625
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:22,463
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin's with her right now?</font>

626
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,163
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

627
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:27,723
<font color="yellow">I guess we have no control over relationships.</font>

628
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:31,263
<font color="yellow">I did my best to break the two up,</font>

629
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,693
<font color="yellow">but it's out of my hands.</font>

630
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:37,023
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

631
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,363
<font color="yellow">You said she left.</font>

632
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:43,463
<font color="yellow">She moved away to distance herself from us and our family...</font>

633
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:45,493
<font color="yellow">and she got into an accident.</font>

634
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:48,693
<font color="yellow">- An accident? - A fire.</font>

635
00:41:48,693 --> 00:41:50,563
<font color="yellow">She was hurt.</font>

636
00:41:52,263 --> 00:41:54,493
<font color="yellow">I don't think Dong Jin and Yun Shil...</font>

637
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:57,593
<font color="yellow">will be able to break up.</font>

638
00:41:57,663 --> 00:42:00,123
<font color="yellow">You can't say that, Mother.</font>

639
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:02,463
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me...</font>

640
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:05,063
<font color="yellow">when I gave up my pride to beg the majority shareholders...</font>

641
00:42:05,063 --> 00:42:07,193
<font color="yellow">to bring him back to Meesa as CEO.</font>

642
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:11,563
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that you still think so highly of Dong Jin,</font>

643
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:14,723
<font color="yellow">but I think the flame that you two had...</font>

644
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:17,723
<font color="yellow">burned out long ago.</font>

645
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:21,333
<font color="yellow">I would like it if you gave up.</font>

646
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:24,993
<font color="yellow">Don't beg to make the impossible possible.</font>

647
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,063
<font color="yellow">I thought you would take my side.</font>

648
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:29,923
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed.</font>

649
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,993
<font color="yellow">I won't give up on Dong Jin.</font>

650
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:36,463
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

651
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,393
<font color="yellow">bring him back to where he belongs.</font>

652
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,123
<font color="yellow">I'll come back again.</font>

653
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,763
<font color="yellow">She should have been nice to him when she had the chance.</font>

654
00:42:56,993 --> 00:43:00,793
<font color="yellow">Have you accepted Yun Shil as your daughter-in-law?</font>

655
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:03,093
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

656
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:05,863
<font color="yellow">I never said that.</font>

657
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:07,663
<font color="yellow">That's what you just said.</font>

658
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,593
<font color="yellow">I said she can stay because I feel sorry for her.</font>

659
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:12,163
<font color="yellow">That's all I meant.</font>

660
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:15,223
<font color="yellow">I will never understand.</font>

661
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:19,363
<font color="yellow">Why does she have to be so stubborn when she will accept her in the end?</font>

662
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,723
<font color="yellow">What did you just hide?</font>

663
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:46,863
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

664
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:50,193
<font color="yellow">It's not nothing. You were looking at something.</font>

665
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:55,593
<font color="yellow">Do you read racy magazines when I'm not looking?</font>

666
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:58,263
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

667
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,063
<font color="yellow">What did you hide, then?</font>

668
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:07,763
<font color="yellow">Our wedding photos?</font>

669
00:44:12,223 --> 00:44:13,963
<font color="yellow">You should have said so.</font>

670
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:16,163
<font color="yellow">Why did you hide them in a hurry?</font>

671
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,063
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy inside.</font>

672
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:25,063
<font color="yellow">Everyone will suffer because of me.</font>

673
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,163
<font color="yellow">That's why I should leave you.</font>

674
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:29,963
<font color="yellow">That's the right thing to do.</font>

675
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:33,263
<font color="yellow">Yet, I still want you and want to be with you...</font>

676
00:44:33,563 --> 00:44:36,993
<font color="yellow">and I hate myself for being like that.</font>

677
00:44:38,223 --> 00:44:40,023
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy.</font>

678
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,093
<font color="yellow">You ran away and said you want to leave me.</font>

679
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,923
<font color="yellow">That broke my heart to pieces...</font>

680
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,663
<font color="yellow">and now you're being so sweet.</font>

681
00:44:54,763 --> 00:44:57,693
<font color="yellow">I just can't hate you even if you do something so hateful.</font>

682
00:44:57,693 --> 00:44:59,193
<font color="yellow">It's driving me crazy.</font>

683
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:02,823
<font color="yellow">I'm not joking. I'm serious.</font>

684
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:06,393
<font color="yellow">Corny comments sound worse when they're said in a serious tone.</font>

685
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:11,723
<font color="yellow">Can't you give me a break?</font>

686
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:16,863
<font color="yellow">I feel like I aged 10 more years while you were away.</font>

687
00:45:16,863 --> 00:45:18,963
<font color="yellow">Do you see my dark circles?</font>

688
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,063
<font color="yellow">Once we get home...</font>

689
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:26,493
<font color="yellow">I'll tell my parents that we'll get married.</font>

690
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:29,623
<font color="yellow">- You can't run away. - You can't do that.</font>

691
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:33,293
<font color="yellow">You met my mum and dad, didn't you?</font>

692
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:35,963
<font color="yellow">They only allowed me to come home.</font>

693
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,663
<font color="yellow">They didn't say we could get married.</font>

694
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:40,493
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing.</font>

695
00:45:40,493 --> 00:45:42,663
<font color="yellow">How is that the same thing?</font>

696
00:45:42,663 --> 00:45:44,723
<font color="yellow">I know my mum.</font>

697
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:47,093
<font color="yellow">Eat well, sleep well and get well soon...</font>

698
00:45:47,093 --> 00:45:49,493
<font color="yellow">so we can ask for their blessing, okay?</font>

699
00:45:52,723 --> 00:45:53,993
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired.</font>

700
00:45:53,993 --> 00:45:56,923
<font color="yellow">I'm exhausted. I could pass out right now.</font>

701
00:45:57,793 --> 00:45:58,963
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

702
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:02,623
<font color="yellow">Can't you just give me an answer?</font>

703
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,893
<font color="yellow">Will you?</font>

704
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:14,063
<font color="yellow">This is the obedient Shiny Eyes I'm used to.</font>

705
00:46:15,593 --> 00:46:16,693
<font color="yellow">Lean on me.</font>

706
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:18,863
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

707
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:22,863
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

708
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:26,123
<font color="yellow">I like this one.</font>

709
00:46:32,863 --> 00:46:35,623
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry, honey.</font>

710
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,023
<font color="yellow">Don't call me that.</font>

711
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:40,493
<font color="yellow">You said you were pregnant like it was nothing...</font>

712
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:42,493
<font color="yellow">because you act like we're married.</font>

713
00:46:42,893 --> 00:46:45,423
<font color="yellow">I will get pregnant when we get married.</font>

714
00:46:45,623 --> 00:46:47,863
<font color="yellow">Can't I use the excuse a bit in advance?</font>

715
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:49,793
<font color="yellow">Is it that wrong?</font>

716
00:46:49,793 --> 00:46:52,623
<font color="yellow">You still don't get it, do you?</font>

717
00:46:54,823 --> 00:46:56,293
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

718
00:46:57,663 --> 00:47:01,093
<font color="yellow">How could you lie about that of all things?</font>

719
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:05,063
<font color="yellow">I didn't want Hyo Sang and Ji Yun to get married before us.</font>

720
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:06,323
<font color="yellow">I told you that...</font>

721
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,023
<font color="yellow">we'll go at our own pace, regardless of them.</font>

722
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:12,393
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

723
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:19,423
<font color="yellow">I apologised sincerely.</font>

724
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:21,363
<font color="yellow">Will you accept it?</font>

725
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:27,393
<font color="yellow">I should apologise to you.</font>

726
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,193
<font color="yellow">You were anxious enough to lie about being pregnant.</font>

727
00:47:34,263 --> 00:47:35,863
<font color="yellow">I'm not good enough.</font>

728
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:40,563
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. You did nothing wrong.</font>

729
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:43,623
<font color="yellow">Then come with me...</font>

730
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:46,093
<font color="yellow">and ask for forgiveness.</font>

731
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:47,863
<font color="yellow">Will you?</font>

732
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:53,163
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you forgive me?</font>

733
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,893
<font color="yellow">I said I should be the one to apologise.</font>

734
00:47:56,423 --> 00:48:00,663
<font color="yellow">Then can I go back to calling you "honey"?</font>

735
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:04,923
<font color="yellow">Honey. Honey. Honey.</font>

736
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:08,123
<font color="yellow">You already did.</font>

737
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:16,163
<font color="yellow">You smiled. My honey smiled.</font>

738
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:18,423
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

739
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:22,993
<font color="yellow">Honey. Honey. Honey.</font>

740
00:48:22,993 --> 00:48:24,563
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Honey.</font>

741
00:48:24,563 --> 00:48:25,593
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

742
00:48:34,223 --> 00:48:35,323
<font color="yellow">Watch your step.</font>

743
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:41,193
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's freezing.</font>

744
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:47,363
<font color="yellow">Here. You can wear this, Dong Sook.</font>

745
00:48:48,723 --> 00:48:49,763
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

746
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,193
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

747
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:56,663
<font color="yellow">You have to sing. Keep your throat warm.</font>

748
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:58,923
<font color="yellow">I said I'm okay.</font>

749
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:04,193
<font color="yellow">Let's wrap you up.</font>

750
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:06,893
<font color="yellow">- There. - Thanks.</font>

751
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:10,363
<font color="yellow">We should get a car so we can drive to all your gigs.</font>

752
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,323
<font color="yellow">We had to take three different buses today.</font>

753
00:49:13,323 --> 00:49:16,193
<font color="yellow">It took us half a day to get here.</font>

754
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:17,993
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

755
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:19,693
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

756
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:23,593
<font color="yellow">there's not a single soul, it's so cold.</font>

757
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,493
<font color="yellow">What kind of a festival is this?</font>

758
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,493
<font color="yellow">We'll see. Let's go.</font>

759
00:49:28,493 --> 00:49:29,593
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

760
00:49:30,223 --> 00:49:32,263
<font color="yellow">(Trout and Smelt Festival)</font>

761
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:34,593
<font color="yellow">- Get on. - What?</font>

762
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:41,123
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - We're off.</font>

763
00:49:44,263 --> 00:49:46,793
<font color="yellow">Round, round, round</font>

764
00:49:47,023 --> 00:49:50,463
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are so round</font>

765
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:56,563
<font color="yellow">I have fallen, fallen, fallen into them</font>

766
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:58,423
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

767
00:49:58,423 --> 00:50:01,993
<font color="yellow">When you are tired</font>

768
00:50:01,993 --> 00:50:04,093
<font color="yellow">Lean on my shoulders</font>

769
00:50:04,093 --> 00:50:05,493
<font color="yellow">Sung Tae Pyung.</font>

770
00:50:05,493 --> 00:50:09,123
<font color="yellow">When you are sick</font>

771
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:12,223
<font color="yellow">Don't hesitate to give me a call</font>

815
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:56,393
<font color="yellow">I don't think I do. Why?</font>

816
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:59,323
<font color="yellow">Come over to my place for dinner.</font>

817
00:52:59,493 --> 00:53:00,723
<font color="yellow">Is it a special day?</font>

818
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:02,423
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

819
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:04,423
<font color="yellow">Then why are you inviting me?</font>

820
00:53:04,423 --> 00:53:07,723
<font color="yellow">I want to apologise for causing a ruckus last time,</font>

821
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:10,793
<font color="yellow">and I want to tell you something, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">You don't look good. Are you sick?</font>

827
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:28,263
<font color="yellow">I didn't sleep well last night.</font>

828
00:53:28,963 --> 00:53:30,023
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

829
00:53:37,793 --> 00:53:40,393
<font color="yellow">I can wash my own face.</font>

830
00:53:40,663 --> 00:53:42,863
<font color="yellow">Not with a huge needle stuck in your arm.</font>

831
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:45,463
<font color="yellow">You have a cold and cold water's bad for you,</font>

832

<font color="yellow">so we'll make do with this for now.</font>

833
00:53:49,363 --> 00:53:51,763
<font color="yellow">Someone might think I'm seriously ill.</font>

834
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:53,723
<font color="yellow">You had a 40-degree fever,</font>

835
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:56,263
<font color="yellow">carbon monoxide poisoning and got burned.</font>

836
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:57,963
<font color="yellow">That's bad enough.</font>

837
00:53:58,493 --> 00:54:01,863
<font color="yellow">Now your whole face is shiny and clean.</font>

838
00:54:02,893 --> 00:54:04,993
<font color="yellow">It's time to put on some lotion.</font>

839
00:54:05,223 --> 00:54:07,623
<font color="yellow">- It's fine. - It's not fine.</font>

840
00:54:08,223 --> 00:54:10,263
<font color="yellow">- Close your eyes. - Why should I...</font>

841
00:54:10,693 --> 00:54:11,723
<font color="yellow">close my eyes?</font>

842
00:54:11,723 --> 00:54:14,463
<font color="yellow">They'll sting if you don't. Close your eyes.</font>

843
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:23,193
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

844
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:26,093
<font color="yellow">I'm putting lotion on your face. Why are you sticking out your lips?</font>

845
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:29,793
<font color="yellow">What does lotion have to do with lips?</font>

846
00:54:30,323 --> 00:54:33,593
<font color="yellow">Did you think I brought this so I could kiss you?</font>

847
00:54:34,323 --> 00:54:35,893
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

848
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,193
<font color="yellow">I was just hoping...</font>

849
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:40,723
<font color="yellow">you'd moisturise my lips, too.</font>

850
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:43,393
<font color="yellow">The room's dry...</font>

851
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:45,593
<font color="yellow">and my lips got chapped.</font>

852
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:47,363
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

853
00:54:48,263 --> 00:54:49,363
<font color="yellow">I got imaginative.</font>

854
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:51,163
<font color="yellow">You're so silly.</font>

855
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,263
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes...</font>

856
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:53,863
<font color="yellow">and I'll moisturise your lips.</font>

857
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:06,593
<font color="yellow">Put this on yourself.</font>

858
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:10,093
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd do that.</font>

859
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,223
<font color="yellow">You just made me feel silly.</font>

860
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:16,493
<font color="yellow">You're back to being your cute self.</font>

861

<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

868
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:37,993
<font color="yellow">As you know, Tonelli...</font>

892
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,323
<font color="yellow">It actually happened after I met you.</font>

893

895
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,163
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,763
<font color="yellow">A fashion magazine reporter said...</font>

904

<font color="yellow">He came via Hong Kong.</font>

906
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:14,763

907
00:57:15,463 --> 00:57:17,863
<font color="yellow">Isn't it strange that he didn't contact us?</font>

<font color="yellow">Isn't this supposed to be a festival?</font>

915
00:57:59,493 --> 00:58:01,163
<font color="yellow">Why are there so few people?</font>

916
00:58:01,163 --> 00:58:03,223
<font color="yellow">No one in Korea is in the mood to have fun.</font>

923
00:58:30,893 --> 00:58:32,493
<font color="yellow">For dragging you here...</font>

<font color="yellow">This is how every singer starts out.</font>

928
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:45,423
<font color="yellow">Don't let it get to you.</font>

929
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:48,563
<font color="yellow">Let's eat the noodles and cheer up.</font>

930
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:50,423
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

931
00:58:52,323 --> 00:58:54,263
<font color="yellow">It's cooked.</font>

932
00:58:55,423 --> 00:58:56,963
<font color="yellow">Let's have a bite.</font>

933
00:59:05,223 --> 00:59:07,493
<font color="yellow">That is delicious. Your turn.</font>

934
00:59:11,163 --> 00:59:13,263

936
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,993
<font color="yellow">You came in together.</font>

937
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,693
<font color="yellow">She came over to the store and walked me back.</font>

938
00:59:31,793 --> 00:59:33,023
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

939
00:59:33,223 --> 00:59:35,763
<font color="yellow">Sam Do says you like cheesecake.</font>

940
00:59:38,763 --> 00:59:42,163
<font color="yellow">I don't like cheesecake. I like sweet potato cakes.</font>

941
00:59:42,563 --> 00:59:44,723
<font color="yellow">You know nothing about me.</font>

942
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:48,423
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

943
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:54,493
<font color="yellow">It happens.</font>

946
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:00,493
<font color="yellow">Hello, Seung Woo.</font>

947
01:00:02,093 --> 01:00:03,393
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

948
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:07,563

<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

950

<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

952
01:00:16,263 --> 01:00:19,023
<font color="yellow">If people saw you, they'd take you for...</font>

953
01:00:19,023 --> 01:00:21,823
<font color="yellow">father and son. Right, Young Eun?</font>

954

<font color="yellow">There's not much but I hope you enjoy yourself.</font>

957
01:00:33,993 --> 01:00:35,063
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Sun Nyeo.</font>

958

965
01:00:58,763 --> 01:01:00,963
<font color="yellow">but he likes this dish.</font>

966
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,493
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

967
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:07,063
<font color="yellow">Later.</font>

968
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,623

<font color="yellow">Honey, are you crying? Why?</font>

973
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:33,463
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

974
01:01:34,763 --> 01:01:37,793
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I was thinking about something.</font>

975

<font color="yellow">It looks good.</font>

978
01:01:45,093 --> 01:01:48,623
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo, why do you keep saying strange things today?</font>

979
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:51,863
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Let's eat.</font>

<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

986
01:02:17,493 --> 01:02:19,663

987
01:02:19,663 --> 01:02:22,223
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong when I was pregnant,</font>

988
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:24,793

<font color="yellow">Please forget that I grabbed you by your collar...</font>

994
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:41,393

<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

1004

<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

1005
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:16,163
<font color="yellow">Why don't you try wearing lower heels for your health?</font>

1006
01:03:17,963 --> 01:03:21,223
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who thinks of me.</font>

1007

<font color="yellow">I slept scrunched up on the couch,</font>

1019

<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

1023
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:18,693

1024
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,163
