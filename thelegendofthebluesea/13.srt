<font color="yellow">Even if we watch the black box video, it was dark and he was wearing a cap so we can't tell who it is.</font>

294
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,600
<font color="yellow">Something must come out, be it DNA or fingerprints.</font>

295
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,650
<font color="yellow">He is soooo despicable.</font>

296
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,810
<font color="yellow">I oughto! Can I hit him once?</font>

297
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,410
<font color="yellow">I won't stop you.</font>

298
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,130
<font color="yellow">We can't find a fingerprint.</font>

299
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,270
<font color="yellow">You don't need to mind him. Didn't anything come out?</font>

300
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,920
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes.</font>

301
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,940
<font color="yellow">The only thing that's in the car is this doll.</font>

302
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,730
<font color="yellow">Octopus. This is yours, right? The one you dropped?</font>

303
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,410
<font color="yellow">Please take a look at the trash can nearby.</font>

304
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,700
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

305
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,430
<font color="yellow">I warned you. Who are you to command...</font>

306
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,830
<font color="yellow"><b>Hospital.- What hospital?</b></font>

307
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,700
<font color="yellow">Since he abandoned the taxi so I let go of that question.</font>

308
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,380
<font color="yellow">Since he fled from the hospital in a haste so he wouldn't have time.</font>

309
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,930
<font color="yellow"><i>There was a big container filled with water inside the operating room.</i></font>

310
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,200
<font color="yellow">If Ma Dae Young moved that water container, there would still be fingerprints left.</font>

311
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,090
<font color="yellow">But then, if that is the case, why did Ma Dae Young get water?</font>

312
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,830
<font color="yellow">Out of nowhere.</font>

313
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,960
<font color="yellow">You are quitting?</font>

314
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,900
<font color="yellow">Oh my, why ahjumma? Did I do something that upset you?</font>

315
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,410
<font color="yellow">No. Just, I want to rest.</font>

316
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:10,130
<font color="yellow">No. It's not easy to find someone who works as hard as you do.</font>

317
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,930
<font color="yellow">And at first, I thought you had a weird personality.</font>

318
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,870
<font color="yellow">But I adjusted to it now.</font>

319
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Because of personal reasons.</font>

320
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,690
<font color="yellow">Ahhh.</font>

321
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,290
<font color="yellow">Aren't you protesting to have your pay raised?</font>

322
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,000
<font color="yellow">No. It's not like that.</font>

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,170
<font color="yellow">Aunt. You should step out of this.</font>

324
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,970
<font color="yellow">No. It seems like she has set her heart to it, so why hold her back, Unni?</font>

325
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,700
<font color="yellow">Ahjumma, even if you go at least until we get someone to take over</font>

326
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,900
<font color="yellow">work until then. That is manners.</font>

327
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,850
<font color="yellow">Yes. I will work until you get someone else. I'm so sorry.</font>

328
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,640
<font color="yellow">Then, for the mean time you are still working, right?</font>

329
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,740
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere after I get off work.</font>

330
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,770
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

331
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,490
<font color="yellow">I will send you the address, you just have to go there. Would that be alright, Unni?</font>

332
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,000
<font color="yellow">Agh! That!</font>

333
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,390
<font color="yellow">Over here.</font>

334
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,660
<font color="yellow">Oh my world. How?</font>

335
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,510
<font color="yellow"><b>Thank you.- It's okay.</b></font>

336
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,260
<font color="yellow">I'm so grateful so I should do something.</font>

337
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,950
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

338
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,490
<font color="yellow">Then, bye!</font>

339
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,540
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

340
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,460
<font color="yellow">I met such a whacko.</font>

341
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,750
<font color="yellow">Ahjummoni, I waited for 10 minutes. Why are you so late?</font>

342
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,840
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I met a pickpocket on the way.</font>

343
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,180
<font color="yellow">Whose house is this?</font>

344
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,830
<font color="yellow">My boyfriend... to be's house.</font>

345
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,800
<font color="yellow">Since your cooking matches their tastes, I leave it to your care.</font>

346
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,070
<font color="yellow">Why aren't they opening?</font>

347
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, Miss. Is this your house?</font>

348
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,940
<font color="yellow">Ahh! Are you Cha Si Ah's mother?</font>

349
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,230
<font color="yellow">She's not my mother. She's the ahjummoni working in our house.</font>

350
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,170
<font color="yellow">But then, how do you know each other?</font>

351
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,050
<font color="yellow">I told you I met a pickpocket earlier. She's the one who got my bag back.</font>

352
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,160
<font color="yellow">Do you also hit pickpockets?</font>

353
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,270
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

354
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,890
<font color="yellow">Leave it, I will do it.</font>

355
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,900
<font color="yellow">That, seriously!</font>

356
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,960
<font color="yellow">As expected, Heo Joon Jae. His room is also clean.</font>

357
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,710
<font color="yellow">So that is the room that girl lives in?</font>

358
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Jae, these are the files you asked for regarding Kin Dam Ryeong.</i></font>

359
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,930
<font color="yellow"><i>As I looked again when organizing the files, I think you and Kim Dam Ryeong really look alike.</i></font>

360
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,480
<font color="yellow">Is she his mother? She's beautiful.</font>

361
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,040
<font color="yellow">No. No, she's probably someone who looks like her.</font>

362
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,600
<font color="yellow">Faces are just</font>

363
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,810
<font color="yellow">like this and that.</font>

364
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,500
<font color="yellow">What treatment did Ma Dae Young get from there?</font>

365
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,850
<font color="yellow">Well, psychologic</font>

366
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,880
<font color="yellow">He used to go once or twice for treatment and get prescriptions.</font>

367
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,440
<font color="yellow">Then he would probably need medication to be able to drive even now.</font>

368
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,240
<font color="yellow">If not, how would he be able to live?</font>

369
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,570
<font color="yellow">Well, that could be.</font>

370
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,440
<font color="yellow">As if. What crazy doctor would give treatment to a fugitive?</font>

371
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,210
<font color="yellow">Right. We'll also check it.</font>

372
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,190
<font color="yellow">Please stop right up front.</font>

373
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,360
<font color="yellow">No, not here. A bit there. It's cold outside.</font>

374
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,540
<font color="yellow">More, more, more.</font>

375
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,870
<font color="yellow">Then, work hard.</font>

376
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,510
<font color="yellow">I thought I was escorting a team leader. Why are we so obedient?</font>

377
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:26,820
<font color="yellow">It's fake. Heo Joon Jae is just a bait to catch Ma Dae Young.</font>

378
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,610
<font color="yellow">We are just using him.</font>

379
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,640
<font color="yellow">Why do I always feel that that is not the case?</font>

380
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Now tell me about Joon Jae's mother.</i></font>

381
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,270
<font color="yellow"><i>I also don't know well. They got separated when he was 10 and he's looking for her until now. That's about it.</i></font>

382
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,500
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know where she has been hiding well. She's going around and not leaving traces so I can't find her.</i></font>

383
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,060
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to find her. Where is she?</i></font>

384
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,580
<font color="yellow"><i>I really have confidence I could do well.</i></font>

385
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,040
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

386
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,830
<font color="yellow">You don't know. It's something people in the internet use a lot.</font>

387
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,530
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it's a relief since you're saying it's delicious.</font>

388
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,280
<font color="yellow">Oh my. When is your boyfriend coming? I'm almost done.</font>

389
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,170
<font color="yellow">Whose boyfriend? Perhaps Heo!</font>

390
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,600
<font color="yellow">Should we go now?</font>

391
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,770
<font color="yellow">Oh my, what's wrong with you Cha Si Ah?</font>

392
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,000
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

393
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,930
<font color="yellow">Yes. Right now.</font>

394
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,230
<font color="yellow">I'm going.</font>

395
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,690
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

396
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Go straight.</font>

397
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,320
<font color="yellow">A little bit more.</font>

398
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,590
<font color="yellow"><b>Go on. - Oh my, I could open it myself.</b></font>

399
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,390
<font color="yellow">There's an urgent matter.</font>

400
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,120
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth.</font>

401
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,810
<font color="yellow">Who do you take after...</font>

402
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,150
<font color="yellow">that you still can't do that multiplication table.</font>

403
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,350
<font color="yellow"><b>I'm back.- Yes.</b></font>

404
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,400
<font color="yellow">What should I do with you?</font>

405
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,410
<font color="yellow"><b>Unni. - You're here.</b></font>

406
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,900
<font color="yellow">Solve it, what are you doing?</font>

407
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,330
<font color="yellow"><b>Where did you go with ahjumma?- You said ahjummoni has a son, right?</b></font>

409
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,270
<font color="yellow">Have you heard anything about her son?</font>

410
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,160
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

411
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:22,360
<font color="yellow">Her son is so good looking and...</font>

412
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,340
<font color="yellow">He went to KAIST.</font>

413
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,150
<font color="yellow">No... they don't keep in touch.</font>

414
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:38,410
<font color="yellow">After she got divorced they lived apart and just heard news from each other from time to time.</font>

430
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,860
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

431
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,700
<font color="yellow">I have thought about this... until now, ahjummoni-</font>

466
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,100

<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

486
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,190
<font color="yellow">Is regular daily activities still possible?</font>

487
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:57,660

<font color="yellow"><i>Men, even though they're easy but they fall for hard to get women.</i></font>

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,970
<font color="yellow">What is that exactly? Easy but hard.</font>

505
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,170
<font color="yellow"><i>They accept date offers but refuse skinship.</i></font>

506
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,340
<font color="yellow">Why? Such a good thing. Why refuse it?</font>

507
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,030
<font color="yellow">So annoying.</font>

508
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,190

509
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,240
<font color="yellow">Refuse the second time but say okay on the third? Why?</font>

510
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,810
<font color="yellow"><i>First love to a man is?</i></font>

511
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,550
<font color="yellow"><i>Stigma</i></font>

512
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,660
<font color="yellow">I heard that first love to a man is like a stigma.</font>

513
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,610
<font color="yellow">Once it has been stamped on your heart it does not go away.</font>

517
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,230
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

518
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:17,960
<font color="yellow">Since Se Hwa has left such a big stamp on your heart that is why you had such a sad dream.</font>

519
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
<font color="yellow"><b>That's not it...- I also found out.</b></font>

<font color="yellow">That a man's first love does not come true.</font>

521
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,500
