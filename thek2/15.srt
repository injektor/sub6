<font color="yellow">Wow, everyone is
working so hard.</font>

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,040
<font color="yellow">You all sure are working hard!</font>

<font color="yellow">I...</font>

8
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,250
<font color="yellow">don't want you to worship me.</font>

<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,250
<font color="yellow">- I just...
- You just wanted to coddle me.</font>

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,840
<font color="yellow">And make me into another
one of your slaves.</font>

12
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,650
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>An intruder has arrived.</i></font>

14
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,150

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,650
<font color="yellow">Mirror, lock the door.</font>

16
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,490
<font color="yellow">This is a bomb.</font>

17
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,250
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to
hear you from in there.</font>

18
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,650
<font color="yellow">That's a bomb.</font>

19
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,050
<font color="yellow">That son of a bitch.</font>

20
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,440
<font color="yellow">Let's talk! I can't hear you!</font>

23
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,550
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

24
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,550
<font color="yellow">You didn't even call ahead.</font>

25
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,640
<font color="yellow">President.</font>

26
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,250
<font color="yellow">You should've told me beforehand
if you were going to invite a guest.</font>

27
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam. I apologize.</font>

28
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,440
<font color="yellow">I only did it for the sake
of the company...</font>

29
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,850
<font color="yellow">Shut your goddamn mouth!</font>

30
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on, Big Sis.</font>

31
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,140
<font color="yellow">You're going to break my eardrums.</font>

32
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,850
<font color="yellow">What in the world is going on?</font>

33
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,050
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully to what I'm
saying from here on out.</font>

34
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,940
<font color="yellow">So, what brings you here?</font>

35
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,640
<font color="yellow">Me? Well, I came to
install some bombs here.</font>

36
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,140
<font color="yellow">Watch.</font>

37
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,850
<font color="yellow">Open it up.</font>

38
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,140
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

39
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,940
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

40
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,640
<font color="yellow">All of you are watching!</font>

41
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,850
<font color="yellow">All right, there we go.</font>

42
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,640
<font color="yellow">There we go.
Two hours is plenty, right?</font>

43
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,350
<font color="yellow">For our conversation.</font>

44
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
<font color="yellow">Mirror, soundproof the room again.</font>

45
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,850
<font color="yellow">Where's Anna right now?</font>

46
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,640
<font color="yellow">Despite all this, she's the only
person you're worried about.</font>

47
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,140
<font color="yellow">I asked you where Anna is.</font>

48
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,050
<font color="yellow">She might have gotten
on the plane by now.</font>

49
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,850
<font color="yellow">Or she might still be at the airport.</font>

50
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,050
<font color="yellow">She's going to Lafelt.</font>

51
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,350
<font color="yellow">Well, sure. That's still the best
thing you've ever done for Anna.</font>

52
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,250
<font color="yellow">Mirror, turn "Outside
Communication" mode back on.</font>

53
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,440
<font color="yellow">It seems that you've come to
take Cloud Nine for yourself.</font>

54
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, Kim Je Ha.
How's your health?</font>

55
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,550
<font color="yellow">So you're still alive, huh?</font>

56
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,640
<font color="yellow">You two sure go all out
when it comes to family feuds.</font>

57
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,050
<font color="yellow">That's just how our family is.</font>

58
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,250
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, Big Sis.
Pick up the phone.</font>

59
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,440
<font color="yellow">It's probably my partner.</font>

60
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,640
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

61
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,350
<font color="yellow"><i>A video call from
Assemblyman Park Kwan Soo, Madam.</i></font>

62
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,140
<font color="yellow">Pick up the call.</font>

63
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

64
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,440
<font color="yellow"><i>Good evening... or is it?
I'm not too sure, Madam.</i></font>

65
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,140
<font color="yellow">As you can see.</font>

66
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,250
<font color="yellow"><i>My knight went to capture
the queen for me.</i></font>

67
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,050
<font color="yellow">So, did you send him
over to kill me?</font>

68
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!
Don't say such scary things!</font>

69
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,140
<font color="yellow">Politicians need to solve things
with words, up to a certain point.</font>

70
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,350
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

71
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, you say this with
a gun in your hand though.</font>

72
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Discussions are no fun unless
they're done like that, after all.</i></font>

73
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Just like last time.</i></font>

74
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,640
<font color="yellow"><i>You do remember how I almost
died last time, don't you?</i></font>

75
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,450
<font color="yellow">So what is it that you want
from me this time?</font>

76
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,040
<font color="yellow">All I need is
Kim Suk Han's memory card.</font>

77
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
<font color="yellow"><i>Pretty simple, right?</i></font>

78
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,540
<font color="yellow">And all I need is Cloud Nine.</font>

79
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,040
<font color="yellow">Mirror, turn on the soundproofing.</font>

80
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,350
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just be honest
and tell them that you don't have it?</font>

81
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,450
<font color="yellow">What are you planning to do?</font>

82
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,950
<font color="yellow">I'll have to get him.</font>

83
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,640
<font color="yellow">Mirror, turn "Outside
Communication" mode back on.</font>

84
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,640
<font color="yellow">You keep asking me
for the impossible!</font>

85
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,040
<font color="yellow">Firstly, I can't give you
Suk Han's memory card.</font>

86
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,250
<font color="yellow">Because I don't have it.</font>

87
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,450
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

88
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,140
<font color="yellow">Is that really true?</font>

89
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

90
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,640
<font color="yellow">Kim Je Ha hasn't handed
it over to us yet.</font>

91
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,950
<font color="yellow">If you give us some time,
we can find out where it is right away.</font>

92
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, Mercenary.</i></font>

93
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,640
<font color="yellow"><i>You still haven't handed it over yet?</i></font>

94
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. If only that guy hadn't tried
to take it from me back then</font>

95
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,350
<font color="yellow">it would've been
in your hands by now.</font>

96
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,250
<font color="yellow">And I wouldn't have ended up
in this state either.</font>

97
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,140
<font color="yellow">Why'd you do that? Did you not
want to pay me that badly?</font>

98
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, come now.</i></font>

99
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, come on. There's no way
I would've ordered them to do that.</font>

100
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,950
<font color="yellow">It was probably due to some unnecessary
emotional battles between young people.</font>

101
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,350
<font color="yellow"><i>You beat up that guy a lot
until now, after all.</i></font>

102
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,140
<font color="yellow"><i>You completely destroyed
him on certain occasions.</i></font>

103
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,140
<font color="yellow">Well, yeah. I did beat
him up quite a lot.</font>

104
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,350
<font color="yellow">Payment? Money?</font>

105
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,140
<font color="yellow">Then was he working together with
Assemblyman Park Kwan Soo?</font>

106
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,640
<font color="yellow">Yep.</font>

107
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,250
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who hired that mercenary.</font>

108
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,540
<font color="yellow">Did you lie to the members
of the consortium then, Madam?</font>

109
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,850
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

110
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,250
<font color="yellow">Seems like I owe you an apology.</font>

111
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,950
<font color="yellow">You damned traitor.</font>

112
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,250
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you planning to do?</i></font>

113
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,250
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you
to leave Anna alone.</font>

114
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,140
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll have to get
Park Kwan Soo.</i></font>

115
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,640
<font color="yellow"><i>Wow, what a scary fellow he is.</i></font>

116
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,040
<font color="yellow">Aw, I feel so bad
for Madam Choi.</font>

117
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,850
<font color="yellow">She didn't even know that, and...</font>

118
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,950
<font color="yellow"><i>So? Did you lose
that memory card?</i></font>

119
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,040
<font color="yellow">No. I've been keeping
it nice and safe.</font>

120
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,540
<font color="yellow">Can you bring it to me now?</font>

121
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,640
<font color="yellow">What about the money?</font>

122
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,950
<font color="yellow">Oh, of course I'll give it to you!
I'll even give you a bonus too!</font>

123
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,350
<font color="yellow">So hurry and bring it over.
You know where I am, right?</font>

124
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,350
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

125
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,040
<font color="yellow">Well, I've gotten what I want, so...</font>

126
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,850
<font color="yellow">you siblings enjoy
a nice chat, all right?</font>

127
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,640
<font color="yellow"><i>All right, goodbye, then.</i></font>

128
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,950
<font color="yellow">Here, Miss. Your ticket.</font>

129
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,750
<font color="yellow">I've checked all your luggage in too.</font>

130
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

131
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,540
<font color="yellow">Mirror, turn on the soundproofing.</font>

132
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,040
<font color="yellow">Will you be able to do it
in your current state?</font>

133
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,950
<font color="yellow">Send Chief Joo to the site, please.</font>

134
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,540
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

135
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,850
<font color="yellow">Also... I won't be coming back.</font>

136
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,950
<font color="yellow">Just leave Cloud Nine
behind and go outside.</font>

137
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,850
<font color="yellow">I feel like you'll become a bit happier
than you are now if you do that.</font>

138
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,450
<font color="yellow">I can't leave Mirror behind.</font>

139
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,250
<font color="yellow">Because...</font>

140
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,040
<font color="yellow">Mirror is me.</font>

141
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,450
<font color="yellow">That's true. I'm sure she is.</font>

142
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:47,950
<font color="yellow">Because Mirror possesses an incredible
power that you can't give up.</font>

143
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,950
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

144
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,040
<font color="yellow">So you've realized it as well, huh?</font>

145
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,040
<font color="yellow">That's why I allowed you to
have access to Mirror.</font>

146
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,950
<font color="yellow">Just look.</font>

147
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,630
<font color="yellow">He's the chairman of a large conglomerate
and has everything he could ever want</font>

148
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,450
<font color="yellow">and yet he's going to such lengths
to have Mirror for himself.</font>

149
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,850
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,250
<font color="yellow">this is already yours now.</font>

151
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,640
<font color="yellow">If anyone experiences
Mirror's powers firsthand...</font>

152
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,640
<font color="yellow">they'll become greedy and want
Cloud Nine for themselves.</font>

153
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,250
<font color="yellow">So as long as you're
the witch that rules Cloud Nine</font>

154
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,640
<font color="yellow">you'll be its slave.</font>

155
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,140
<font color="yellow">So hurry up and leave this place.</font>

156
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,040
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Chairman Choi
and Park Kwan Soo on my own.</font>

157
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,540
<font color="yellow">If only we'd met...</font>

158
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,640
<font color="yellow">under better circumstances
or at a better time.</font>

159
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,350
<font color="yellow">Farewell.</font>

160
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
<font color="yellow">Mirror, turn "Outside
Communication" mode back on.</font>

161
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,450
<font color="yellow">Hey, back off.</font>

162
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:44,650
<font color="yellow">Also, Mirror, close the door and lock
it as soon as I leave this room.</font>

163
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, I shall.</i></font>

164
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,150
<font color="yellow">Open it.</font>

165
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,450
<font color="yellow">You think you'll be able
to manage in that state?</font>

166
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,450
<font color="yellow">Hey, shut it.
Let's hurry and go.</font>

167
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,950
<font color="yellow">Lead the way.</font>

168
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,340
<font color="yellow">All right, then.
We have to take care of our deal now.</font>

173
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,950
<font color="yellow">Young Miss. Make sure you
keep my number. Don't delete it!</font>

174
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,340
<font color="yellow">I'll never change my number.</font>

175
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,250
<font color="yellow">Of course.
Why would I erase it?</font>

176
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,450
<font color="yellow">What a strange sense of
affection this is.</font>

177
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,750
<font color="yellow">All we ever did was keep watch over you,
keep you trapped, and do mean things</font>

178
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,040
<font color="yellow">and yet, you still care about us!</font>

179
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,540
<font color="yellow">And when we were just about to
be good to you, you have to go!</font>

180
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, don't cry! How am
I supposed to leave then?</font>

181
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam. Don't cry.</font>

182
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,250
<font color="yellow">I mean, she's leaving
because she's succeeded!</font>

183
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,650
<font color="yellow">Young Miss.</font>

184
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,250
<font color="yellow">Go out and live in this big world,
and live however you please.</font>

185
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,840
<font color="yellow">And please forgive me too.</font>

186
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,380
<font color="yellow">And make sure to call
when you arrive, okay?</font>

187
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,650
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

188
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,040
<font color="yellow">Looks like Dad isn't coming
this time either.</font>

189
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,450
<font color="yellow">Please... take good care of Je Ha.</font>

190
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,450
<font color="yellow">Did you forget that
I tried to kill you two?</font>

191
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,450
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

192
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,650
<font color="yellow">But I'll try to forget
from now on.</font>

193
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,650
<font color="yellow">It's time now. Go on.</font>

194
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,840
<font color="yellow">Go to Sungdonghwa Hospital's parking lot.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Yes.</i></font>

198
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,250
<font color="yellow">I see. So he left.</font>

199
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,650
<font color="yellow">Then first, shut off the elevator.</font>

200
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,150
<font color="yellow">And cut off all cell reception.</font>

201
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,040
<font color="yellow">Go and check!</font>

202
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,040
<font color="yellow">The door won't open, sir.</font>

203
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, come on.
Why are you being like this?</font>

204
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,250
<font color="yellow">I told you, this is a bomb, Big Sis!</font>

205
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,650

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,250

<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

260
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,450
<font color="yellow">No need to feel self-conscious.
I'll give you all a billion won each.</font>

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,340
<font color="yellow">it'll just explode!</font>

268
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,650
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

269
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,670
<font color="yellow">Really? Okay.</font>

270
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,340
<font color="yellow">Then forget my last order for now.</font>

271
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,040
<font color="yellow">Wow. It was a good try though, Big Sis.</font>

272
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,650
<font color="yellow">But did you think that I really
didn't think this far ahead?</font>

273
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,250
<font color="yellow">I think you'll end up
dying after all.</font>

274
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,650
<font color="yellow">Can you all step outside?
We need to talk.</font>

275
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,650
<font color="yellow">Yeah, go outside and stand by.</font>

276
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:59,450
<font color="yellow">Also, take good care
of the president.</font>

277
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,950
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you did make
great preparations.</font>

278
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,650
<font color="yellow">But you really don't know
people, do you?</font>

279
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,650
<font color="yellow">Soon, those guys will be
pointing their guns at you</font>

280
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,950
<font color="yellow">to make you defuse the bomb.</font>

281
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,250
<font color="yellow">And they'll want me to reactivate
the elevator after that.</font>

282
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,340
<font color="yellow">If they kill you for me.</font>

283
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,180
<font color="yellow">You've made a grave mistake
walking into this place.</font>

284
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,540
<font color="yellow">There's no exit for you here.</font>

285
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,340
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's me.
I got the memory card.</font>

286
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,040
<font color="yellow">Really? Good job! Good job!</font>

287
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,250
<font color="yellow">What should I do with this guy now?</font>

288
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,950
<font color="yellow">Well, you have to get
rid of him, of course.</font>

289
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.
Just a moment.</font>

290
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,750
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

291
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,950

292
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,510
<font color="yellow">- Get up.
- Yes.</font>

293
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,250
<font color="yellow">You okay?</font>

294
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,150
<font color="yellow">No. Just a sec.</font>

296
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,150

297
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,250
<font color="yellow">Oh... oh, Mercenary!</font>

298
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,540
<font color="yellow">Is that you?</font>

299
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's me.</font>

300
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,950
<font color="yellow">What about the guy
who was with you?</font>

301
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,840
<font color="yellow">Aw man. Well...</font>

302
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,450
<font color="yellow">he went and died already.</font>

303
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,340
<font color="yellow">So, about the money.
Is it ready?</font>

304
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,450
<font color="yellow">Um, yeah! Of course!</font>

305
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,650
<font color="yellow">I just need to go to the place
where your safe is, right?</font>

306
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,150
<font color="yellow">Um, yeah. At my place.</font>

307
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,450
<font color="yellow">Oh man. This punk.</font>

308
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,540
<font color="yellow">Just what kind of punk
is he, anyway?</font>

309
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,950
<font color="yellow">Did you find the memory card?</font>

310
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,450
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

311
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,650
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

312
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,650
<font color="yellow">Hurry to the hospital now.</font>

313
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,750
<font color="yellow">No. This isn't yours anymore.</font>

314
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,040
<font color="yellow">I have to reveal its contents
to the world now.</font>

315
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,950
<font color="yellow">Chairman Choi has broken into
Cloud Nine and installed a bomb there.</font>

316
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,840
<font color="yellow">To steal Cloud Nine.</font>

317
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,340
<font color="yellow">We have to take down Park Kwan Soo
and Chairman Choi right now!</font>

318
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,340
<font color="yellow">And in order to do that, we have to
expose its contents to the world.</font>

319
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,950
<font color="yellow">Agent Kim.</font>

320
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,250
<font color="yellow">If we do that now, it'll be the end of
the assemblyman's political career too.</font>

321
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,040
<font color="yellow">Give it to the assemblyman. We must use
it for JSS or for his political career!</font>

322
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,650
<font color="yellow">No. We have to stop Park Kwan Soo
and Chairman Choi right now!</font>

323
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,250
<font color="yellow">I know!
But this is no simple matter.</font>

324
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,840
<font color="yellow">JB and Jinhan will both be in
danger if you release it now.</font>

325
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
<font color="yellow">Then what'll happen
to the presidential race?</font>

326
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,450
<font color="yellow">Do you know what will happen
if we don't release this now?</font>

327
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,340
<font color="yellow">Chairman Choi will get
Cloud Nine for himself!</font>

328
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,650
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

329
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,950
<font color="yellow">Choi Yoo Jin could die
alongside Cloud Nine.</font>

330
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,950
<font color="yellow">Je Ha. For the greater
good, sometimes...</font>

331
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,150
<font color="yellow">The greater good?</font>

332
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,450
<font color="yellow">You're the same as ever, aren't you?</font>

333
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,150
<font color="yellow">You said that small fry needed to
be sacrificed for the "greater good"</font>

334
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,650
<font color="yellow">back when I had to
leave the army, didn't you?</font>

335
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,150
<font color="yellow">I'm not telling you to sacrifice
yourself this time, though!</font>

336
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, Je Ha. I have to hold onto that
for me to realize my dream</font>

337
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,650
<font color="yellow">and for you to get your revenge.</font>

338
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,340
<font color="yellow">What about Ume Hye Rin then?</font>

339
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,650
<font color="yellow">And what about Anna?</font>

340
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:25,450
<font color="yellow">If it's hard for you,
I'll do it myself.</font>

341
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,250
<font color="yellow">Don't make me shoot
you, Agent Kim.</font>

342
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,340
<font color="yellow">You said that these people were quite
formidable when I first joined JSS.</font>

343
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,250
<font color="yellow">And that they'd definitely
get the presidency.</font>

344
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,150
<font color="yellow">But look.</font>

345
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,340
<font color="yellow">You, Chief...</font>

346
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,650
<font color="yellow">are throwing away the last shreds of
morality you have left for him.</font>

347
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,840
<font color="yellow">What about you then?</font>

348
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,150
<font color="yellow">You killed civilians in Iraq
just for some money</font>

349
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,950
<font color="yellow">and ran away because you got fired
from your last employer, didn't you?</font>

350
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,650
<font color="yellow">What you said is
both wrong and right.</font>

351
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,840
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

352
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,250
<font color="yellow">It's true that I became a killer-for-hire
after I was cast aside by the country.</font>

353
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,840
<font color="yellow">And it's true that I did
mercenary work. But...</font>

354
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,940
<font color="yellow">I never killed any civilians.</font>

355
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,070
<font color="yellow">The reason why I was actually
being pursued is because</font>

356
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,520
<font color="yellow">Blackstone found out that I was
going to stand as a witness at</font>

357
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,750
<font color="yellow">the International Criminal Court about
the murder of civilians in Iraq.</font>

358
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,440
<font color="yellow">And they were after me
to stop me from doing so.</font>

359
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,650
<font color="yellow">Je Ha.</font>

360
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,650
<font color="yellow">You said that I was
a puppet, didn't you?</font>

361
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,750
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

362
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,150
<font color="yellow">But now, we're about
to lose Cloud Nine.</font>

363
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:59,650
<font color="yellow">So if we don't have the memory card,
I'll be even less than a mere puppet.</font>

364
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,840
<font color="yellow">I'll become a scarecrow.</font>

365
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,150
<font color="yellow">Assemblyman!</font>

366
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,840
<font color="yellow">Why would you be a scarecrow?</font>

367
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,940
<font color="yellow">You have to be a father to Anna now!</font>

369
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,490
<font color="yellow">I've grown sick and tired of you people.</font>

370
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,940
<font color="yellow">My original motive was protecting
Anna from Choi Yoo Jin</font>

371
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,250
<font color="yellow">and killing Park Kwan Soo.</font>

372
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,540
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm off to kill
Park Kwan Soo now.</font>

373
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,470
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

374
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,440
<font color="yellow">Aren't these C-4 explosives?</font>

375
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,540
<font color="yellow">Hey, Agent Kim.</font>

376
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,940
<font color="yellow">How are you going to
do this by yourself?</font>

377
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,650
<font color="yellow">You saw what was
in the trunk, didn't you?</font>

378
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,150
<font color="yellow">Surely you're not planning to...</font>

379
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,650
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to
blow yourself up too?</font>

380
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, Agent Kim!</font>

381
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,840
<font color="yellow">Hey! Agent Kim!</font>

382
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,040
<font color="yellow">Big Sis!</font>

383
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,040
<font color="yellow">Can't you just give me Mirror?</font>

384
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,440
<font color="yellow">Let's share Mirror. Please?</font>

385
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,940
<font color="yellow">Now you're planning
to nag me about it?</font>

386
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,150
<font color="yellow">Let's be real. Didn't you give up on JB
when you decided to marry Brother-in-Law?</font>

387
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,250
<font color="yellow">I was quite jealous of the courage you
had to be able to do that back then.</font>

388
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,250
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

389
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,840
<font color="yellow">Your mom stole JB from me.</font>

390
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,440
<font color="yellow">I envied you.</font>

391
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,250
<font color="yellow">You're not the daughter of
some mistress like I am.</font>

392
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,340
<font color="yellow">Everyone liked you and said that
you'd become the next chairwoman.</font>

393
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,650
<font color="yellow">And of course, I didn't
doubt that in the slightest.</font>

394
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,440
<font color="yellow">But you made me most envious of you</font>

395
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,840
<font color="yellow">when you refused to
get an arranged marriage</font>

396
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,250
<font color="yellow">and married Brother-in-Law.</font>

397
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,540
<font color="yellow">I had a woman that I loved too, you see.</font>

398
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,650
<font color="yellow">But I had no choice
but to give her up.</font>

399
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,250
<font color="yellow">I would've actually believed that
lie if I were a bit more gullible.</font>

400
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, damn it!</font>

401
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,340
<font color="yellow">I almost had you.</font>

402
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,650
<font color="yellow">Man, you sure are clever, Big Sis.</font>

403
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,250
<font color="yellow">But it is true that Father had higher
hopes for you than he did for me.</font>

404
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,640
<font color="yellow">And judging from what I just heard</font>

405
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,650
<font color="yellow">didn't Dad tell President Gook to cover
up the fact that you killed Ume Hye Rin?</font>

406
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,250
<font color="yellow">What would you know?</font>

407
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,540
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

408
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,840
<font color="yellow">Then let's do this, Big Sis.</font>

409
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,250
<font color="yellow">I'll give you half of my JB shares.</font>

410
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,040
<font color="yellow">So let's both use Mirror together.</font>

411
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,440
<font color="yellow">Isn't that fair?</font>

412
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,440
<font color="yellow">So after I get Jinhan, you can
be the chairwoman of JB Group.</font>

413
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,540
<font color="yellow">And I'll be the chairman of Jinhan.</font>

414
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

415
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,750
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

416
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,250
<font color="yellow">Since the clock is still ticking,
is it making you uneasier?</font>

417
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,040
<font color="yellow">Sung Won.</font>

418
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that when you
first came in here with that</font>

419
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:27,540
<font color="yellow">you wanted to take
Mirror or just destroy it.</font>

420
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,840
<font color="yellow">You didn't think that
we'd have to die here together.</font>

421
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,840
<font color="yellow">But now that you can't leave, the
only thing you can do is defuse the bomb.</font>

422
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,750
<font color="yellow">So why would I agree to
make any kind of deal with you?</font>

423
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,440
<font color="yellow">Before those guys out there get
anxious and turn into feral beasts</font>

424
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,150
<font color="yellow">just defuse the bomb now
and take it out of here.</font>

425
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,650
<font color="yellow">If you do that, I won't kill
you, at the very least.</font>

426
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,540
<font color="yellow">Um, Assemblyman.</font>

427
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,940
<font color="yellow">Will you really do a press conference?</font>

428
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:16,250
<font color="yellow">There's only one reason why I've covered
up your corruption and stuck around.</font>

429
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,840
<font color="yellow">It was the constant amount
of authority you always exuded.</font>

430
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,040
<font color="yellow">But if you want to throw
all of that away now</font>

431
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,540
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to
remain by your side.</font>

432
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,540
<font color="yellow">Geez, you sure are
coming on strong, punk.</font>

433
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,840
<font color="yellow">Chief Joo.</font>

434
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

435
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,040
<font color="yellow">I believe that Madam should
have a say in a situation like this, sir.</font>

436
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,040
<font color="yellow">That's true too.</font>

437
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,540
<font color="yellow">Call Choi Yoo Jin.
Let's see how she's holding up.</font>

438
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,250
<font color="yellow"><i>A call from Assemblyman
Jang Se Joon, Madam.</i></font>

439
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,540
<font color="yellow">Wow, that sure was fast. Not.</font>

440
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,150
<font color="yellow">I'll take his call.</font>

441
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, Assemblyman? Go ahead.</font>

442
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:06,150
<font color="yellow">Oh, so it seems that the bomb
hasn't gone off yet.</font>

443
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,940
<font color="yellow">What, are you sad that it hasn't?</font>

444
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,040
<font color="yellow">You seem to have some time,
so I'd like to ask you something.</font>

445
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,840
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

446
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,040
<font color="yellow">Je Ha left a gift to me.</font>

447
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,540
<font color="yellow">It's Kim Suk Han's memory card.</font>

448
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,650
<font color="yellow">Oh no, Sung Won.</font>

449
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,750
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

450
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:45,250
<font color="yellow">He told me that I had to hurry
and release this if I'm to save you.</font>

451
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,440
<font color="yellow">Je Ha... said that?</font>

452
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, he did. But...</i></font>

453
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,040
<font color="yellow">what should I do?</font>

454
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,840
<font color="yellow">Should I release it or not?</font>

455
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,150
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?
Why would you do that?</font>

456
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,040
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Sung Won.</font>

457
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,040
<font color="yellow">He won't allow the bomb to go off.</font>

458
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,040
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then...</font>

459
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,150
<font color="yellow"><i>I think we should
take this chance</i></font>

460
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,150
<font color="yellow">to straighten Park Kwan
Soo and the consortium out.</font>

461
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:25,940
<font color="yellow">I should... wait, no. You call
ex-Chairman Park directly.</font>

462
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,540
<font color="yellow">And tell them that we'll destroy
the consortium and Park Kwan Soo</font>

463
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,150
<font color="yellow">and JB as well
if they don't straighten up.</font>

464
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,540
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it seem like more of
a realistic threat if you say it?</font>

465
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,250
<font color="yellow">As to be expected of my wife.</font>

466
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,940
<font color="yellow">What about Je Ha?</font>

467
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,840
<font color="yellow">What about him?</font>

468
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,650
<font color="yellow">His condition.</font>

469
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,040
<font color="yellow">Well, he doesn't look
like he's doing that well.</font>

470
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,340
<font color="yellow">Where did he...</font>

471
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,340
<font color="yellow">No, never mind.</font>

472
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,440
<font color="yellow">See you later at home.</font>

473
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,840
<font color="yellow">Looks like Park Kwan Soo will soon
pull out of the race of his own volition.</font>

474
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,650
<font color="yellow">So? What will you do, Sung Won?</font>

475
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:26,040
<font color="yellow">Should we just destroy everything
and I'll begin JB anew?</font>

476
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,840
<font color="yellow">Cancel the press conference.</font>

477
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,150
<font color="yellow">And call Chairman Park.</font>

478
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir!</font>

479
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chairman Park.</font>

480
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,040
<font color="yellow">An interesting item
has fallen into my hands.</font>

481
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,840
<font color="yellow">It's Kim Suk Han's memory card.</font>

482
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,150
<font color="yellow">Oh, why are you so shocked?</font>

483
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,340
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're a member
of the consortium too.</font>

484
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,340
<font color="yellow">I'd like to see all those
members face-to-face</font>

485
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,250
<font color="yellow">and have a cup of coffee with them.</font>

486
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,900
<font color="yellow">What? Jang Se Joon
has the memory card?</font>

487
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. Does he know
what's in there too?</font>

488
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,540
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

489
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,250
<font color="yellow">Then, um...
well, firstly... I... okay.</font>

490
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,040
<font color="yellow">Oh my. This is bad.</font>

491
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,300
<font color="yellow">Then, does that mean that Kim Je Ha
gave it to Assemblyman Jang?</font>

492
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,150
<font color="yellow">Yeah. There's something
strange going on with him.</font>

493
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,250
<font color="yellow">I think he's a double agent
for me and Choi Yoo Jin.</font>

494
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,040
<font color="yellow">Turn the car around!
Turn the car around!</font>

495
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,250
<font color="yellow">- Yes, sir.
- And, you!</font>

496
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes, sir?
- Call men to the hideout</font>

497
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,540
<font color="yellow">and make sure you
catch him, all right?</font>

498
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

499
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:07,040
<font color="yellow">Wait. Jang Se Joon has
a daughter named Anna, right?</font>

500
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

501
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,150
<font color="yellow">Call the Police Chief
and tell him to get her.</font>

502
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

503
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,840
<font color="yellow">We'll get rid of both Jang Se Joon
and Kim Je Ha tonight!</font>

- Your girlfriend. Go Anna.</font>

kidnapped Anna.</font>

Young Miss was kidnapped?</font>

<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?
What do you mean, she's been kidnapped?</font>

545
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,540
<font color="yellow">But we just saw her board the plane!</font>

546
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,440

Park Kwan Soo may have kidnapped her!</font>

547
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
<font color="yellow">I think Mr. Je Ha is going after them.</font>

548
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,540
<font color="yellow">Hello?
This is the airport, right?</font>

549
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,150
<font color="yellow">I want to know about a plane
that was scheduled to leave.</font>

550
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,440

To what do I owe this pleasure?</font>

551
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,040

554
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:05,340
<font color="yellow">Oh, of course. A person's life
is at stake here, after all.</font>

555
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,840
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
I wouldn't have you killed.</font>

556
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

557
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,440
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not talking about me.</font>

558
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,340
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

559
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,040

560
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,040
<font color="yellow">Dad! Save me!</font>

561
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
<font color="yellow">Anna!</font>

562
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:42,840
<font color="yellow">How about you stop looking
at that unpleasantness now?</font>

563
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,840
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you doing?</font>

564
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,440
<font color="yellow">Come, now.
Calm down.</font>

565
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,540

anything now, right?</font>

567
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,650
<font color="yellow">Bring me Kim Suk Han's memory card.</font>

568
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,440

Ah, yes. Cloud Nine.</i></font>

but I'm at a loss for options, so...</font>

573
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,340
<font color="yellow">That's fair, right?</font>

574
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:21,150
<font color="yellow">You know... killing
young ladies and such...</font>

doing such things, but...</font>

card that you can't copy data from.</i></font>

<font color="yellow">The cops got there right before
the plane left and took her.</font>

591
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,940
<font color="yellow">I think Park Kwan Soo
was telling the truth.</font>

<font color="yellow">Anna!</font>

596
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,050
<font color="yellow">Anna!</font>

597
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,150
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

598
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,840

00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,250
<font color="yellow">Please help me!</font>

601
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,340

Kill him now!</font>

00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,250
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

603
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,650
<font color="yellow">You too.</font>

<font color="yellow">Are you all right, Young Miss?</font>

608
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes!</font>

609
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,340
<font color="yellow">Master Song!</font>

610
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,250
<font color="yellow">Who are you people?</font>

611
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,150
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

612
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,440
<font color="yellow">- Master Song!
- Go, quickly!</font>

613
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,940
<font color="yellow">- But...
- Now!</font>

614
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,550
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

615
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,840
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.</font>

616
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, I surprised you, didn't I?
I'm sorry.</font>

617
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,750
<font color="yellow">M-Master Song.
It was you?</font>

618
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,490
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

619
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:42,150
<font color="yellow">On that night...</font>

620
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,050
<font color="yellow">the person who covered my
mouth and flashed a light on me...</font>

621
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,440
<font color="yellow">Young Miss.</font>

622
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,250
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

623
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:54,840
<font color="yellow">On that night...</font>

624
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,840
<font color="yellow">Um, Mr. Je Ha.</font>

625
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,550
<font color="yellow">Um, don't overreact, okay?
Let's settle this with words.</font>

626
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,750
<font color="yellow">Let's settle this with words!
How about it?</font>

627
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,550
<font color="yellow">Where's Anna?</font>

628
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:12,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, um, Anna?
S-she's at Cloud Nine.</font>

629
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,250
<font color="yellow">She's there now.
You should hurry.</font>

630
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,840
<font color="yellow">- You drive.
- N-now?</font>

631
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,440
<font color="yellow">Um, we can't go there now.</font>

632
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,250
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

633
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,940
<font color="yellow">Well, um...</font>

634
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,250
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine!</font>

635
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,940
<font color="yellow">The... the bomb will go off soon.</font>

636
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,650
<font color="yellow">And when it does,
everyone there will die!</font>

637
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:39,990
<font color="yellow">Then you can just stop
it from exploding.</font>

638
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,840
<font color="yellow">That'd be nice, but...</font>

639
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,750
<font color="yellow">you can't defuse it
once it's been set.</font>

640
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,050
<font color="yellow">Chairman Choi doesn't know that.</font>

641
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, damn it.</font>

642
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:05,650
<font color="yellow">No! No!</font>
