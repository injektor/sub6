1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,630
You're already awake, I was worried that I might be calling too early,

2
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,870
What is the matter?

3
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,100
Well, it's about Ms Kim Hye Gyeong,

4
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,900
I looked into it to report to the higher-ups,

5
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,600
Gosh, how should I word this?

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,070
I don't care whether you two stay married or become business partners,

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,000
but you shouldn't do anything that will cause trouble later,

8
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,370
I halted the investigation for now,,,

9
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,630
and told them that you'll take care of it,

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,630
Thank you,

11
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,070
I'll take care of our business, so please turn a blind eye to it,

12
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,400
I'll be sure not to worry you,

13
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,130
This footage itself is quite shocking,

14
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,400
but his will doesn't say that it's because of pressure from work,

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,900
It could be difficult to prove it,

16
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,900
Bae Dong Joon has been mistreated ever since,,,

17
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,730
he refused to be laid off,

18
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,340
He worked alone by the bathroom for seven months,

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,570
He even saw a psychiatrist because of depression,

20
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,730
We haven't heard anything from the company, right?

21
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,770
No, no words from them yet,

22
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,270
They said they'd be in touch some time this morning,

23
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,270
but they haven't, Does it mean they want to take it to court?

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,170
They must be busy calculating, This isn't just about Mr Bae,

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,630
Eight employees didn't give in to the company's pressure,,,

26
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,900
to make them voluntarily resign, and seven of them sued the company,

27
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,770
And one of them committed suicide just before the trial,

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,300
This is a big headache for the company, too, They'll try to settle,

29
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
If every single one of them go up on the stand,,,

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,830
and reveal what the company did to lay them off,

31
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,300
the company's brand image will be ruined completely,

32
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,570
How about we choose Mr Bae's wife as our first witness?

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,770
She can testify immediately after we play the footage,

34
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,800
That can boost the number of articles about the case,,,

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,330
and make the company become more inclined to settle,

36
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,900
Has she seen this footage, though?

37
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,070
No, she just know that the footage exists,

38
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,470
Then it's a little,,,

39
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,170
I'll try to persuade her,

40
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,870
They have three children, and she's a stay-at-home mum,

41
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,200
She must need money,

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,070
Also, she probably doesn't want her husband's death to be buried away,

43
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,770
We must be forceful from the get-go in order to make the company,,,

44
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,570
apologise and give proper compensation,

45
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,070
I think that's the best thing we can do,,,

46
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,170
for the late Mr Bae as well as his children,

47
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,370
- Mum, answer my call - I'm sorry,

48
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,200
- Mum - It must be your kids, Answer it,

49
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,400
Hye Gyeong has gotten quite aggressive,

50
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,030
Isn't that what you wanted?

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,800
I didn't mean it in a bad way,

52
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
We must think carefully when we choose clients,

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,830
But once we decide, we should do whatever it takes to win,

54
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,630
In that sense, she is doing very well,

55
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,530
That is true,

56
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,500
but you can't stop once you cross the line,

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,070
We'll be like, "Just a little more," Then we'll ruin our reputation,

58
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,470
Are you talking about yourself?

59
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,300
We still have a long way to go, It's too early to worry,

60
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,170
The former director, Yun Jeong Ki, who fled to the States got,,,

61
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,400
in touch through his lawyer to say that he wants to return to Korea,

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
He wants favourable arrangements in return for files,,,

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,100
about the Dream UCT slush funds,

64
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,530
What should we do?

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,670
But isn't it illegal to bargain for a lighter sentence?

66
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,730
What in the world are you talking about?

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,330
Shall we stop the investigation, then?

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,970
He'll be sentenced to five years in prison upon landing in Korea,

69
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,100
Will you come back if you were him?

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Joon Ho,

71
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,000
We're dealing with scums here,

72
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,700
There's only one mistake we can make,

73
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,570
It's being clumsy and letting criminals walk away,

74
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,200
Okay,

75
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,030
Also, Congressman Kim basically notified us,,,

76
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,230
that he'd respond to the subpoena after his term,

77
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,530
Tell the media about the investigation on him,

78
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,770
especially things about money and his women problems,

79
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,170
Keep doing it until he volunteers to show up in court,

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Sure,

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,970
All right, Let's begin,

82
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,800
Oh, there's one more thing,

83
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,640
I looked into Law Firm MJ and there is something fishy,

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,100
Seo Joong Won does run a lawyers' baseball team,

85
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,600
and it's also true that the firm won almost every case,,,

86
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,470
which the team's judges were in charge of,

87
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,800
How should we approach this?

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,970
We don't have any firm evidence, though,

89
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,270
We can't really start investigating just based on our suspicions,

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,570
We could get on the wrong side of the judges, too,

91
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,600
You have a point, too,

92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
However, we can't just bury our suspicions,

93
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,470
Pick out a few suspicious cases that Joong Won has worked on,

94
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,970
Then get in touch with him and see what he says about them,

95
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,370
Yes, Sir,

96
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,970
We heard from the company,

97
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,170
They said they needed more time to finalise their settlement offers,

98
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,270
They'll send their legal representative at 6pm,

99
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,630
That's great, That means they want to settle,

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Well, Dan looked into who their lawyer is and,,,

101
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,070
Lawyer Son Dong Wook?

102
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,530
I'm sure he charges a lot,

103
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,970
Exactly, If they wanted to settle, they wouldn't have hired him,

104
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,030
We'll need to talk to him to find out,

105
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,700
All right, I'll be back soon,

106
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,430
Mum, answer my call

107
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,300
Where are you now?

108
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,070
I'm just having some food,

109
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,970
When can you be back?

110
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,670
If I leave now, it'll take about 30 minutes,

111
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,500
Okay, Hurry up,

112
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,130
Yes, Seo Yeon,

113
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,570
Mum, It's my friend's birthday today,

114
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,670
Can I skip the academy today to go to the party?

115
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,070
All right, Go ahead,

116
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,170
Wait, Which friend is this?

117
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,830
Soo Jin, Han Soo Jin,

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,770
The one you met at the English camp?

119
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Yes,

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,970
I'll think about it, Let's talk when I get home, Okay?

121
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,800
All right,

122
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,470
Yes, President Seo,

123
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,770
Where are you now?

124
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,230
Oh, I was having lunch with Lawyer Seo,

125
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,730
Okay, Come back to the office as quickly as you can,

126
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,730
Okay, I will,

127
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:21,970
(The Good Wife) {\i1\b1\c&H80FFFF&}Synced & ripped by kurirmalam{\c\b\i}\N{\b1\c&H8080FF&}Subtitles by VIU{\c\b}

128
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh, you're here, I'm sorry,

129
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,300
I was just reviewing the case,

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,600
You can't prove anything with this,

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,670
There's no evidence that Mr Bae's suicide was because of the company,

132
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,970
It's nice to meet you again, Lawyer Kim,

133
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,370
It's good to see you again, Have a seat,

134
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,430
Lawyer Son, it's been a while,

135
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,430
Hello,

136
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,270
Shall we talk about the settlement terms right away?

137
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,370
Sure,

138
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,400
The company laid off 150 employees in the last year,

139
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,870
Mr Bae Dong Joon was one of the people who held out against it,

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,500
They are not layoffs, It's voluntary redundancy,

141
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,600
Only those who agreed on the terms left the company,

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,130
It's 100 percent legal,

143
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,930
"Do you want a severance pay equal to three months' salary,,,"

144
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,700
"or do you want to be terminated with nothing at all?"

145
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,870
Do you call threatening employees like this legal?

146
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,500
The company never kicked anyone out,

147
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,530
Everyone who refused the company's offer got to stay,

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,170
They were bullied and harassed until they chose to leave,

149
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,530
They were forced to move by the bathroom,

150
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,000
They weren't given any tasks, so they had to just sit all day,

151
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,470
They couldn't even use the bathroom freely,

152
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,330
Penalty points were given when they used the bathroom over three times,

153
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,130
When the penalty points reached a certain level, they had to go,,,

154
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,700
to the training centre and practise greeting,

155
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,500
That's impossible, I'm sure they got trained on other things, too,

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,170
You're defending a company that has a lot of money but no conscience,

157
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,370
The high-ups who are responsible for the company's loss weren't fired,

158
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,170
They're trying to create profit through the layoffs,

159
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,770
Lawyers should refrain from judging such values,

160
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Here are our conditions,

161
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,600
Mr Bae's family will get 200,000 dollars,

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,530
The others in the class action suit,,,

163
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,070
can continue to work as contract employees,

164
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,670
Contract?

165
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,630
It'll be renewed annually,

166
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,300
They'll be paid 1,5 times more,

167
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,170
We can't accept those terms,

168
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,400
Then I'll see you in court,

169
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,260
All rise,

170
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,460
It is so unfortunate,,,

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,530
to see you both again,

172
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,330
Can we please not let it get too messy this time?

173
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,760
That's a warning, not a request,

174
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,460
You don't have to worry,

175
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,660
I only took this case when I heard,,,

176
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,430
you'd be presiding,

177
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Really?

178
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,430
I know you're fair and just,

179
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,790
I agree,

180
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,290
Hearing you both say that,,,

181
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,660
scares me even more,

182
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
My husband,,,

183
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,590
was under a lot of stress at work,

184
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,230
He said no one gave him any work to do,

185
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,730
He said they did all they could to make him resign,

186
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,030
But,,,

187
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
we had loans,,,

188
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,930
and tuition to pay,

189
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,830
What little severance pay he'd get wouldn't be enough,

190
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,060
I told him,,,

191
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
to try,,,

192
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,990
to keep the job,

193
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,890
I had no idea he was,,,

194
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
that distressed,

195
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,430
I feel so guilty,

196
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,890
That's all,

197
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,560
Will you cross-examine the witness?

198
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,830
Yes,

199
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,890
First of all, I offer my condolences,

200
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,290
I can only guess,,,

201
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,490
what you went through before deciding to testify,

202
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,060
However, we are in court,

203
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,160
So forgive me for the questions I must ask,

204
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,730
- Okay, - Your husband,

205
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,390
Was he seeing a psychiatrist?

206
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,730
Yes,

207
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,590
At first, he was slightly forgetful,

208
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,190
Then he'd gaze into the distance,,,

209
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,660
and get angry over trivial matters,

210
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
I found out later on that,,,

211
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,190
it was around the time his desk was moved near the bathroom,

212
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,960
They did that so everyone could see him,

213
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
My husband,,,

214
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,030
had worked loyally for over 10 years,

215
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,960
Was he diagnosed with depression?

216
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,330
Yes,

217
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,790
I am physically disabled,,,

218
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,690
and I also almost had depression,

219
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,230
I found out then that,,,

220
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,860
depression has no exact cause,

221
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,430
Biochemistry, your genes and the environment,,,

222
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,730
all come together to trigger depression,

223
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,830
You can't contribute it to one,,,

224
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,830
Objection,

225
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,960
The defence is distracting the court,

226
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,160
This case is about a company's unfair treatment,,,

227
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,090
that led to a man's suicide,

228
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,130
The plaintiff has a point,

229
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,460
I don't like where you're going,

230
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,690
Your Honour, I'm not trying to distract anyone,

231
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,990
I'm trying to prove Mr Bae could've died over something else,

232
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,030
Please let me continue,

233
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,390
Okay then, Continue,

234
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,490
Thank you,

235
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,630
Was your husband treated for depression?

236
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,560
Yes, He did his best to,,,

237
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,060
What was he prescribed?

238
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,560
Did he take his medication?

239
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,060
Yes, I don't remember what the medicine was called,

240
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,860
but he never forgot to take the medicine the doctor gave him,

241
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,030
However, the stress he got at work was just too much,

242
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,860
He couldn't sleep at night,

243
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
Thank you,

244
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
It was Elvatil,

245
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,690
That's what he was prescribed,

246
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,490
Was Mr Bae,,,

247
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,490
aware of the medication's side effects?

248
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,490
Objection,

249
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,630
Lawyer Kim's in court,

250
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm not here to see her,

251
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,630
We should've met for a meal after the lawsuit,

252
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,430
I'm always here,

253
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,030
You have a lovely office,

254
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,660
My mother always told me to be a lawyer,

255
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,090
That way, I could make millions,,,

256
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,690
in comfort,

257
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,960
So why are you a prosecutor?

258
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,690
I couldn't stand watching criminals,,,

259
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,590
get away with it,

260
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,130
Do you understand how I feel?

261
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,130
No, I'm a lawyer,

262
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,630
I'm investigating judges for giving and taking bribes,

263
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,290
And your brother's name keeps popping up,

264
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,490
I'm giving you a heads-up before I begin,,,

265
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,730
because of the relationship I have with this firm,

266
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,960
That's such a comfort to hear,

267
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,230
So what?

268
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,560
I want to help,,,

269
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,030
your brother,

270
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,830
But,,,

271
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,260
once I find something on him, I can't cover it up,

272
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,690
Joong Won manages a baseball team for legal professionals,

273
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,290
Many judges are on his team,

274
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
We believe,,,

275
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,660
he introduces judges to wealthy entrepreneurs,,,

276
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,100
where they exchange money,,,

277
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,930
for shorter sentences,

278
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,830
Prosecutors assume that no one is innocent,

279
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,660
That's why I'm a lawyer,

280
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,260
I believe you are blameless,

281
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,760
Why?

282
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,160
I don't, actually,

283
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,360
I can't be sure of anything until the investigation's over,

284
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,430
One who looks innocent,,,

285
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,460
could be guilty,

286
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,790
The one who looked guilty,,,

287
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,490
could be innocent,

288
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,630
Tell Joong Won that,,,

289
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,600
if he's guilty,

290
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,560
he must tell me,

291
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,460
If he confesses now,,,

292
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,690
and names the judges he bribed,

293
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,730
I'll cut him a deal,

294
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,600
And if he's innocent?

295
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Then,,,

296
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,830
I will apologise,

297
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,660
Lawyer Son defended Elvatil's manufacturer,,,

298
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,130
in a lawsuit where he insisted there were no side effects,

299
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,260
I'm aware of that, I was the presiding judge,

300
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,060
But now, he's saying the death of my client,,,

301
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,160
can be linked to the drug's side effect,

302
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,190
He has no moral scruples whatsoever,

303
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
That is not true,

304
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,390
I did defend them in court,

305
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,890
but MRG, Elvatil's manufacturer, admitted there were side effects,,,

306
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,630
and settled out of court,

307
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,460
They even took the drug off the market,

308
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,990
What I did,,,

309
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,630
was justified and is neither ethically nor legally wrong,

310
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,660
Then Mr Bae's family should sue MRG as well,

311
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,290
They're a victim of Elvatil's side effects,

312
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,660
They can do that,

313
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
I don't defend MRG any more,

314
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,960
Your Honour, I would like to submit new evidence,

315
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,690
What is it?

316
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,660
It's a footage of an experiment that proves Elvatil causes,,,

317
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,600
violent and suicidal behaviours,

318
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,730
- Ob,,, - Objection,

319
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,790
We took this footage for the Elvatil case,

320
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,530
I know that, I saw it, too,

321
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,630
Are you saying the video you took is not applicable,,,

322
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,360
just because it's a different case?

323
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,890
Lawyer Son has a point,

324
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,360
I accept the evidence,

325
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,630
We need something else,

326
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,190
Something that proves the company drove Mr Bae to suicide,

327
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,660
Won't we find something on their security footage?

328
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,990
It's all gone,

329
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,990
They had a problem with the server or whatever,

330
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,860
We only have footage of the suicide because,,,

331
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,390
we got it right away thinking it was murder,

332
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,930
What about the prosecution?

333
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,560
Won't they have other tapes?

334
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,790
They could,

335
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,860
but would they hand them over?

336
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,060
Lawyer Kim,

337
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,430
I was very disappointed,

338
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,890
How dare you make the widow watch her husband kill himself?

339
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,390
Are you saying you can do anything but I cannot?

340
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,190
You have a reputation to keep,

341
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,430
Lawyer Kim followed my orders,

342
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,660
Then I guess,,,

343
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,830
that means she's still,,,

344
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,830
the sweet, kind and gentle lawyer,

345
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,160
What a relief,

346
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,760
I'll see you soon in court,

347
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,060
Why did you say that?

348
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,830
We did what we should to win the law,,,

349
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,960
It's obvious,,,

350
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,560
what he'd do if I said it was your idea,

351
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,060
He'd have alerted the media and said you were corrupt,

352
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,460
To a lawyer, his or her reputation,,,

353
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,430
is very important,

354
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,100
Remember that,

355
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,860
Why say you gave the order if it's that important?

356
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,990
That's what I'm like,

357
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
President Seo,

358
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,390
Can we have a word?

359
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,490
I'm speaking with a bank representative,

360
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,790
He came over when I said I was too busy,

361
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,630
- If you have anything,,, - Right now,

362
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,330
Should I sign here?

363
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,730
- Yes, right there, - Okay,

364
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,790
What is it?

365
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,260
Tae Joon came by when you were out,

366
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,530
I thought he was going to thank us for getting him out,

367
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,530
but then,

368
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,490
he said he'd investigate you,

369
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,430
He'll offer a deal if you confess,

370
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,990
The bribery charges?

371
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,160
Don't worry, I did nothing wrong,

372
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,490
I'll be fine,

373
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,260
Don't say that to me,

374
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,490
Stop seeing her,

375
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,590
Who?

376
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,630
Hye Gyeong,

377
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,830
Don't you see why he's doing this?

378
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,890
It's because you're dating his wife,,,

379
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,530
and he's looking for a reason to come after you,

380
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,530
So stop it,

381
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I,,,

382
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,690
No,

383
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,690
We're serious,

384
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,830
Hye Gyeong will leave him soon,

385
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,290
I understand,

386
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,930
You two are serious,

387
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,490
I'm sure there's a reason to be,

388
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,430
But it's just not wise,

389
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,690
You're Hye Gyeong's superior,,,

390
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,460
and Tae Joon is everyone's favourite prosecutor,

391
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,990
This will ruin not just you but our law firm,

392
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,190
We fought hard to protect it,

393
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,190
Must you ruin it yourself?

394
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,330
I'll help you,

395
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,730
With Tae Joon,

396
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,890
Why do you want to help?

397
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,760
I don't like him, either,

398
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,460
I'll meet Joon Ho and see if he has evidence,,,

399
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,190
or if it's an empty threat,

400
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,590
Thanks, Just a moment,

401
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,690
Can you do something else while you're at it?

402
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,290
I need the security footage the prosecution has,

403
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,590
You always put your cases first,

404
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,090
Okay,

405
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,660
Why did you call?

406
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,290
To ask you something,

407
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,390
Do you know we took a class action suit?

408
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,690
- Yes, - We need footage from the day,,,

409
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,290
Mr Bae died,

410
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,690
Great,

411
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,860
I had a question for you, too,

412
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,730
- What is it? - It's not too hard,

413
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,990
Don't make that face,

414
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,230
We're investigating Joong Won,

415
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,690
Really? For what?

416
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,930
For bribing judges,

417
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,030
We're going over all his cases,

418
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,460
Is it bad?

419
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,130
Yes, pretty bad,

420
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,460
That's why,,,

421
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,390
I need the internal files on the cases,,,

422
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,760
he has worked on,

423
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,960
Let's swap that with what you want,

424
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,560
Then give me the names,,,

425
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,290
of the judges you suspect first,

426
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,690
President Seo worked on so many cases,

427
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,690
I can't get them all,

428
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,760
Here are the court dates and the names of the judges,

429
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,660
You came prepared,,,

430
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,590
and you wanted to balk?

431
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,090
Just in case,

432
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,260
I think you settled in pretty well,

433
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,490
I'm fighting to survive,

434
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,030
Call me when you're ready,

435
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,790
Still at work?

436
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,090
Yes,

437
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,390
I should head home,

438
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,130
What about dinner?

439
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,390
I'm eating with the kids,

440
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,460
I've been going home late,

441
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,790
Shall I join you?

442
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,730
They came by a few times and I never got to say hi,

443
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,790
Getting to know them over dinner,,,

444
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,460
could be good for us,

445
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,090
Well,,,

446
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,990
I'm sure I'll make a good impression,

447
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,230
I know that,

448
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,160
But right now,,, The timing's,,,

449
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,390
Thanks for offering,

450
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,760
Okay, Next time, then,

451
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,060
She lives in Seowon?

452
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,760
Do you have to go that far?

453
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,590
Is it about Soo Jin's brother?

454
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,730
He was jailed for a misdemeanour,

455
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,560
He's a model prisoner and will be out soon,

456
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,330
That's not an issue,

457
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,790
Even your father did time,

458
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,090
I'm just,,,

459
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,690
worried that you only get along,,,

460
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,560
with people who live far away,

461
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,790
You never have school friends over,,,

462
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,330
or go out to see them,

463
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,190
You can't just avoid them,

464
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,330
You have to try to get along,

465
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,460
How can I do that?

466
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,260
Here,,,

467
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,790
everyone knows who Dad is,

468
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,690
Do I have to give up on a friend I've finally made?

469
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,990
Okay then,

470
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,130
Don't be too late,

471
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,460
If you think you'll be late, call and I'll pick you up,

472
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,700
I have it,

473
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,400
The list of cases they think you bribed the judges over,

474
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,100
It's quite long,

475
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,930
Only 1 or 2 will be the real targets,

476
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,830
They gave you a long list,,,

477
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,530
in case you betray them,

478
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,530
Did you really bribe a judge?

479
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
No,

480
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,430
But I can see why these cases,,,

481
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,770
are the targets,

482
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,900
Tell me everything, I said I'd help,

483
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,330
Thank you,

484
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,530
Give me the internal records of those case files,

485
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,930
I said I'd swap those for the security footage,

486
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,830
They'll take it by whatever means possible,

487
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,770
It's best to hand them over and win your case,

488
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,830
Dan,

489
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,700
You will help, right?

490
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,370
There better be no tricks,

491
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,830
Did you take anything out or add anything?

492
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Look who's talking,

493
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,630
You duped me once before,

494
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,870
No, that wasn't me,

495
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,570
That's everything we have,

496
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,770
I didn't delete a single file,

497
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,370
Call if you need anything else,

498
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,630
I'm up for a deal if the conditions are right,

499
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,330
You're Ji Hoon, right?

500
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,670
Yes,

501
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,300
Hello,

502
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,130
My name is Seo Joong Won, I'm your mum's boss,

503
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,700
Yes, I know,

504
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,070
I heard that you're here to fix her computer,

505
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,730
You must know a lot about computers,

506
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,400
No, just a little,

507
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,430
It was infected with something called "ransomware",

508
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,530
It disables files inside the computer,,,

509
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,200
and asks for money in return for a removal software,

510
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,900
Gosh, I don't understand anything you just said,

511
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,430
Your mum was going on about how smart you are, You must be good,

512
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,500
No, It wasn't anything too complicated,

513
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,670
Well, I should go now,

514
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,530
- You're leaving already? - Yes,

515
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,430
Shall I treat you to something delicious?

516
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,370
No, it's okay,

517
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,200
- Goodbye, Sir, - Bye,

518
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,670
I'm going through the security camera footage,

519
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,400
There are many parts that show how the company harassed the employees,

520
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,000
However, none of them are impactful enough for us to use in court,

521
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,230
Nothing can serve as pertinent evidence for the suicide, either,

522
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,030
Collect everything, though, They might lead to something,

523
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,070
I actually have one question,

524
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,070
Other employees sued the company together,

525
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,170
but this woman chose not to participate,

526
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,170
I can't really see her name from here, but,,,

527
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,370
Her name is Noh Eun Ah,

528
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
She quit just before they sued the company,

529
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,530
She visited our firm a few times with her colleagues,

530
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,130
but she gave up just before they filed the suit,

531
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,900
Why?

532
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,500
I don't know,

533
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,330
It'd help us to have more employees in this case,

534
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,170
so we tried to get in touch with her through her colleagues,

535
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,470
However, she hung up as soon as she heard the word "law firm",

536
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,230
She refuses to meet with us, either,

537
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,770
I'll go meet her,

538
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,300
She won't see you,

539
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,500
Don't worry, I can make it work,

540
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,470
The car with the licence number 1780 is yours, right?

541
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,700
I'm so sorry, I think I scratched your car a little,

542
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,470
It looks like a brand new car, I'm very sorry,

543
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,330
I'm right in front of your place now,

544
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,870
Where's the scratch?

545
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm from Law Firm MJ,

546
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,570
You're Noh Eun Ah, right?

547
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,630
You worked at the same company,

548
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,500
As you know, Mr Bae passed away,

549
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,730
So please help us just this once,

550
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,430
We just need you to answer a few questions,

551
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,230
Sure, go ahead,

552
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,370
You were friends with Mr Bae, right?

553
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,700
We were colleagues,

554
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:52,300
Did you know that he was on antidepressants?

555
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,430
The company is insisting that the medication's side effects,,,

556
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,100
are what made him commit suicide,

557
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
You mean Elvatil?

558
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,930
Yes, You even know the name,

559
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,530
Of course, Many people died because of that drug,

560
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,270
I heard it makes people become violent and have suicidal thoughts,

561
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,070
There was a lawsuit regarding it recently,

562
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,070
Dong Joon wasn't on that drug,

563
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,670
How do you know?

564
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,770
I saw it on the news and told him,,,

565
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,170
about how a lawsuit would commence soon because people died,

566
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,070
He thanked me and said that he was thinking about taking it,

567
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,470
Would you be able to say this in court?

568
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,170
Gosh, no way,

569
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,330
You said you're just here to ask a few questions,

570
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,130
I cannot go to the trial,

571
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,040
If you make me go, I'll say that I don't know anything about it,

572
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,270
Where do you work now?

573
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,800
What do you mean?

574
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,570
You quit, so I'm just wondering if you've found a new job,

575
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,570
Of course, I did,

576
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,270
My new job is all right,

577
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,430
Why are you at home during a weekday afternoon, then?

578
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,500
It's none of your business,

579
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,400
I'm just asking because I'm curious to know how you were able,,,

580
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,900
to afford a new car after giving up the lawsuit and quitting your job,

581
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,470
Someone died, He was your friend,

582
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,830
No, your former colleague,

583
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,930
You must've read all the articles about the incident,

584
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,470
The prosecution is immensely interested in the case,

585
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,000
If you don't answer now,

586
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,970
I might ask the prosecution to start investigating,,,

587
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,570
the relationship between you and the company,

588
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,070
It's accounting fraud,

589
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,770
The company's financial situation must've been worse than we thought,

590
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,270
They've been hiding a loss of over 300 million dollars through it,

591
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,800
How did you find out about this?

592
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,930
Noh Eun Ah told me, She found out while reviewing accounting files,

593
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,700
So high-ups in the company bought her off and made her leave,

594
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,600
Bringing up their accounting fraud,,,

595
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,500
will increase our chances of winning in court,

596
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,330
but it'll make the company collapse,

597
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,570
Then our clients won't be able to get a single penny from them,

598
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,400
We need to turn a blind eye to the fraud,,,

599
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,330
if we want our clients to be compensated,

600
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,300
What should we do now?

601
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,430
Should we choose social justice or our clients' profit?

602
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,100
What do you think, Hye Gyeong?

603
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,900
We'd like Noh Eun Ah to be our witness,

604
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,830
Your Honour, Ms Noh isn't in their witness list,

605
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,230
We have the right to ask anyone who was on the company's,,,

606
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,200
layoff list to be our witness,

607
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,900
Noh Eun Ah was on that list,,,

608
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,270
and she resigned one week after Mr Bae's death,

609
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,540
Is Ms Noh here?

610
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,400
Yes, she is,

611
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,230
I accept your request,

612
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,200
Ms Noh, please proceed to the stand,

613
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,730
Your Honour, we'd like to request a short recess,

614
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,730
We weren't expecting this, so we are not prepared to examine her,

615
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,800
Wouldn't it be better to listen to her testimony,,,

616
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,600
and take a recess after?

617
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,800
That way, it'll be better for you to plan your examination,

618
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,170
I'd like to consult with the opposing counsel during the recess,

619
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,630
Prosecutor Lee Tae Joon,

620
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,970
Do you think this will change anything?

621
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,930
What are you talking about?

622
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,300
I'm just investigating suspicious matters I've stumbled upon,

623
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,870
Lawyer Seo, Admit it if you're guilty,

624
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,600
If not, just continue doing what you're doing now,

625
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,330
I didn't do anything wrong,

626
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,300
You're the one who is guilty,

627
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,730
You were always the problem,

628
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,540
Hye Gyeong would've been much happier if it weren't for you,

629
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,230
You mean if she was with you?

630
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Do you think her life would've been better with you?

631
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,930
Do you really think so?

632
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,430
Just punch me,

633
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,540
Be a man, all right?

634
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,330
That's much better than being in this mess,

635
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,070
If you bribed a judge,

636
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,070
you must get locked up in prison,

637
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,630
Only one of us,,,

638
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,500
has experienced what it's like to be locked up in jail,

639
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,200
I'll see you at the trial, then,

640
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,900
Let's say that the company was engaged in accounting fraud,

641
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,930
It is true, We also have a witness,

642
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,800
But you won't be able to reveal it because your clients,,,

643
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,700
won't get any compensations if you do,

644
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,570
Does that mean the company has decided to compensate them?

645
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,800
If the amount is right, yes,

646
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,040
However, the company can't pay too much because it can't,,,

647
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,930
be held responsible for what happened,

648
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,070
The main shareholders won't be okay with it,

649
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,100
500,000 dollars per each employee who sued,

650
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,830
One million dollars for the late Mr Bae's family as an apology,

651
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,000
Aren't the amounts appropriate?

652
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,230
Did you not hear what I just said?

653
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,700
The chairman can use his own money,

654
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,800
He should volunteer to do so to apologise to his employees,

655
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,130
And why should the chairman do that?

656
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,040
If he doesn't do so, he'll be locked up in prison,

657
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,040
We'll tell the media about the fraud if we can't settle today,

658
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,170
If we lose, we won't get a single penny anyway,

659
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,540
We should at least fight for justice in that case,

660
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,730
The amounts you've suggested seem appropriate,

661
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,270
I'll speak to the chairman about it,

662
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,170
Don't be too disappointed,

663
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,330
Are you going to laugh again?

664
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,070
Are you going to stay at this firm?

665
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,630
What do you mean by that?

666
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,070
Come to my firm,

667
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,430
I'll pay you double of what you get now,

668
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,270
You don't even know how much I get paid now,

669
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,670
That doesn't matter,

670
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,230
You're worth every penny,

671
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,230
It's not because of your husband,

672
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,400
It's because I think you have the potential to become a great lawyer,

673
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,170
However, that won't happen at this firm,

674
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,330
We won the case against you, Do you still think it's impossible?

675
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,500
Do you think I lost?

676
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,230
I guess we paid up more than we expected,

677
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,730
Lawyer Kim,

678
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,500
You're maturing fast, It's so entertaining,

679
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,370
(Missed Calls)

680
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,700
(Seo Yeon)

681
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,830
The number you're calling is currently not available,

682
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,970
(Voice mail)

683
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,540
First message,

684
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Hello?

685
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,970
Ji Hoon, are you with Seo Yeon?

686
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,970
No, I'm home, Why?

687
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,800
I missed a call from her when I was working,

688
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,730
I think she went to the academy,

689
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,000
She probably called you by accident, She does that sometimes,

690
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,000
All right, Tell her to call me when she gets home,

691
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
Okay,

692
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Bye,

693
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,200
I heard you guys settled, Good job,

694
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,330
Thank you,

695
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,270
Should we grab some food to celebrate?

696
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,770
Sure,

697
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,100
Let's try this first,

698
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,300
I haven't practised in so long,

699
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,770
We're getting together next week,

700
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,540
They might end up changing my number,

701
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,700
Aren't you guys doing it as a hobby? You must be about the same,

702
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,070
No, we're all different, It depends on how much we practise,

703
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,170
The player number is really important,

704
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,500
It reflects our ability in an objective way,

705
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,370
They say it's random,

706
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,230
but the number really gets to you,

707
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,040
You must be the last number on the team or maybe the bench,

708
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,370
Are you provoking me?

709
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,370
You know you look down on me these days, right?

710
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,830
What are you talking about, Sir?

711
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,570
No way,

712
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,730
My goodness, Me?

713
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,470
Fine, How about a bet, then?

714
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,170
If I hit seven times or more in one game, I win,

715
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,730
Otherwise, you win,

716
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,870
Deal,

717
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,800
How about granting a wish?

718
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,430
No, that won't do,

719
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,540
What if that wish is to get 100 wishes?

720
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,930
Since we're lawyers,

721
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,930
let's just bet on a meal to be sure,

722
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,270
Fine, Today's lunch, The price doesn't matter,

723
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,430
Deal,

724
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Foul,

725
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,400
You're killing it,

726
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,540
Joong Won,

727
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,570
You said that you wanted to be a better person when with me, right?

728
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,270
Yes,

729
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,500
When I'm with you, I think I become my true self,

730
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,870
I'm sorry I missed your call,

731
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,770
Why aren't you picking up, Seo Yeon?

732
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,770
I'm worried so give me a call back,

733
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
What do you want to eat?

734
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,170
Order for me,

735
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,570
He's bluffing,

736
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,600
He's making things up after losing the case,

737
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,600
I can't tell,

738
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,670
He looked quite sincere,

739
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,730
Maybe I'm bad at reading people,

740
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,170
Are you waiting for a call?

741
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Well,,,

742
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,900
I just can't get in touch with Seo Yeon,

743
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,270
Really?

744
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,230
Ji Hoon, did Seo Yeon call?

745
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,270
No,

746
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,630
Is she still not picking up?

747
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,670
Maybe her phone broke,

748
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,270
Anyway, tell her to call me when she gets in,

749
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Okay,

750
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,230
She's still out of reach?

751
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,700
Yes, I'm sure it's nothing,

752
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,470
but it's bothering me,

753
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,800
Right, Can we stop by at her academy? It's around here,

754
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,030
Which way is it?

755
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,330
Seo Yeon?

756
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,070
I saw her leave with some guy on a motorcycle,

757
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,500
A man? What kind of guy?

758
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,030
He looked a little older than us,

759
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,300
He was average height and had short hair,

760
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,870
- Right? - Yes,

761
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,430
Did they look like they knew each other?

762
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,330
We thought so,

763
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,100
Isn't it her brother?

764
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,570
Do you have anyone in mind?

765
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
No,

766
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,270
Let me call Tae Joon, Thank you,

767
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,870
- Bye, - Bye,

768
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
Yes, hello?

769
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,670
Did you get any calls from Seo Yeon?

770
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,770
No, why?

771
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,900
She's out of reach,

772
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,870
Apparently, she was last seen leaving with a guy on a motorcycle,

773
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,670
A motorcycle? With a guy?

774
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Yes,

775
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,870
I'm not sure,

776
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,430
but they say he looked a few years older than her,

777
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,300
Can you think of anyone?

778
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,130
Did Seo Yeon say anything?

779
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,700
Did she talk about her friends?

780
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:20,130
I heard that her new friend from camp has an older brother,

781
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,600
She told me she was going to see her on the weekend,

782
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,170
It's probably nothing much,

783
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,030
They must be friends,

784
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,970
Don't worry too much, I'll look into it,

785
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,630
Call me if you find her,

786
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Okay,

787
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,030
- Prosecutor Park, - Yes,

788
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,870
Come here,

789
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,400
I received a call from my wife,,,

790
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,970
and she says Seo Yeon is out of reach,

791
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Pardon?

792
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,130
I'm sure it's nothing, but you never know,

793
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,270
Well,,,

794
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,430
I need you to track her phone,,,

795
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,000
and get a list of the call records to find out where she is,

796
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,630
But it'll take 3 to 4 hours if we go through the procedure,

797
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,870
Okay, I'd appreciate it, Please do it as soon as possible,

798
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,070
Yes, Sir,

799
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,830
Thank you,

800
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,570
She'll be fine, don't worry, Let's look for her together,

801
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,270
It's okay, I'll go wait for her at home,

802
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,700
I'll drive you home,

803
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,330
It's okay, I can go by myself,

804
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,630
Don't worry, I'm sure she's fine, Bye,

805
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,030
Let me ask you for a favour, It's for Hye Gyeong,

806
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,470
Give me Seo Yeon's number,

807
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,700
It's me, Can you help me track a number?

808
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,770
Are you crazy? How can you ask me that after all this time?

809
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,370
Please, I'll do you a favour in return,

810
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,970
- Mum, you're early, - Yes,

811
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,130
What about Seo Yeon?

812
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,130
She's not home yet,

813
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,130
I just sent it to you, That's the last location it was tracked,

814
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,330
Thank you,

815
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,130
Did you find her?

816
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Prosecutor Lee,

817
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,070
The thing is,

818
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,500
Seo Jin has a friend named Han Soo Jin and her brother,,,

819
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,000
is a kid you arrested before,,,

820
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,470
for assault,

821
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,830
He was given an overnight release from the juvenile hall today,

822
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,470
He's currently missing,

823
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,730
However, he was considered a model prisoner,

824
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,300
He got himself a hair stylist certification,,,

825
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,000
and he doesn't talk to any of his past friends,

826
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,200
I don't care about that,

827
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,500
Report it as an emergency,,,

828
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,700
and find out where Seo Yeon is right now,

829
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,130
Yes, Sir,

830
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,670
(Beauty Supplies)

831
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,200
The number you're calling is currently not available,

832
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,170
Is that you, Seo Yeon?

833
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,670
Is she not back yet?

834
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,200
No,

835
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,630
Don't worry, I'm sure she's fine,

836
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,630
I have people looking for her,

837
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,400
Do you think Mum's really mad?

838
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm not sure,

839
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,300
It was just for a few hours,

840
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,770
My friend's brother was released today and he promised,,,

841
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,330
to perm our hair for the birthday party tomorrow,

842
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,100
I didn't call her,

843
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,270
I think I pressed it by accident when it was in my pocket,

844
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,100
You don't have to explain to me,

845
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,700
Don't worry, I'm sure she isn't mad at you,

846
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,370
She'll be happy to see you,

847
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,300
Aren't you coming in?

848
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,070
No, I'll just go,

849
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,030
She'll want to thank you,

850
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,530
And I'm scared to go up alone,

851
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,900
Can't you come up with me to explain?

852
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,070
You should tell her yourself, You have to,

853
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,070
Also, don't tell her I found you,

854
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,830
Just say that you came home on your own,

855
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,530
Why?

856
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,570
Just because,

857
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,730
Thank you,

858
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,370
Seo Yeon,

859
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,000
Mum,

860
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,670
Gosh,

861
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,500
I'm sorry, Mum, I didn't know you called,

862
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,530
Let me see,

863
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,200
It's okay as long as nothing happened,

864
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,870
- Seo Yeon! - Dad,

865
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,400
Where have you been,,,

866
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,200
Are you all right?

867
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,830
- Where have you been? - Sorry, Dad,

868
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,430
I was so worried,

869
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,700
- You scared me, - Sorry,,,

870
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
Dan,

871
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,200
What are your thoughts on marriage?

872
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,470
Something other people do, but you and I don't,

873
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Why do you ask?

874
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,630
I was jealous of Hye Gyeong's family,

875
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,870
I thought, "It'd be nice for me to have people like them,"

876
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,370
People who,,,

877
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,830
care for me more than I do myself,

878
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,570
No,

879
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,330
"I want to be,,,"

880
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,400
"with the people that I love,,,"

881
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,330
"more than myself,"

882
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,600
Do you think I can't?

883
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,930
No, You can get married if you want to,

884
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,100
What exactly do you want?

885
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:30,900
Is it just a marriage or a marriage with a specific someone?

886
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,700
I'm not sure,

887
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,130
I'd want Hye Gyeong,

888
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,100
then I'd ask myself if what I'm doing is wrong,

889
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,800
I have my sister and the law firm,

890
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,270
I'm not sure if I should fight against Lee Tae Joon,

891
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,600
I don't know what to do,

892
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,530
I don't know if I'm a coward,,,

893
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,900
or too practical,

894
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,900
I don't know,,,

895
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,130
if I can give up on everything,

896
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,770
Do you even know,,,

897
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,870
what Lawyer Kim wants?

898
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,430
I don't know that either,

899
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,230
You should ask her that first,

900
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,700
I'm sure Lawyer Kim,,,

901
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,170
would want you to tell her,,,

902
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,170
what you really want, too,

903
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,800
Thank you for today,

904
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,700
Hye Gyeong,

905
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,230
Can't you reconsider,,,

906
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,730
for the kids?

907
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,300
Not today,

908
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,300
Don't talk about your greed today,

909
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,570
It's been a long day,

910
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,170
Goodnight,

911
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,070
Going down,

912
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,700
Yes, Ma'am,

913
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,330
I'm sorry to call you so late,

914
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,870
Can we meet?

915
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,030
Well,,,

916
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,500
I'm sorry, but I can't leave home tonight,

917
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,670
I'm in your neighbourhood,

918
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:52,830
Hello,

919
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,870
I thought about this a lot,

920
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,030
I wasn't sure if I should talk to you about this,

921
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,100
However,

922
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,030
I think that you should know,

923
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,300
The prosecution is investigating Joong Won,

924
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,070
They will charge him after gathering evidence,

925
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,900
Even if he gets lucky and doesn't go under trial,

926
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,900
it'll be a huge hit to the firm,

927
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,300
What is he charged for?

928
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,170
For bribing judges,

929
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,530
Could it be,,,

930
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,230
Tae Joon?

931
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,100
I don't want to force you,

932
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,470
I want to respect your private life,

933
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,600
However, you need,,,

934
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,570
to make clear choices,

935
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,930
Okay, I understand,

936
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,730
Are you here to visit me?

937
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,870
Did something happen?

938
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,600
No, I just have something to give to you,

939
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,900
It's on your desk,

940
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:55,830
Yes,

941
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,470
I heard Seo Yeon is fine,

942
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,230
Yes, thankfully,

943
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,700
I'm sorry,

944
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,000
About what?

945
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,370
About Seo Yeon,

946
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,170
I don't think I was of any help,

947
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,870
No,

948
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,030
Nothing happened,

949
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,700
But even if something did,

950
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,630
it wouldn't be anyone's fault,

951
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,800
I thought about it all night,

952
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,330
All of the reasons why I should break up with you,

953
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,000
My family, my husband and my career,

954
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,870
However, I wasn't a part of it,

955
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,570
I don't want to lie to myself and give up on my feelings any more,

956
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,570
I want to be with you if it's all right with you,

957
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,000
(Divorce by Mutual Consent)

958
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,930
(Lee Tae Joon, Kim Hye Gyeong)

959
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,900
(The Good Wife)

960
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,400
Will Lee Tae Joon prosecute Joong Won?

961
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:57,870
Have you made your decision?

962
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,270
An investigation on President Seo Joong Won?

963
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,700
President Seo,

964
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:05,430
They say Law Firm MJ fabricated the evidence for the divorce,

965
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,570
It's the case when you first started work here,

966
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,270
Don't you remember?

967
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,100
Are you suspecting me?

968
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,700
I won't let it pass if you or Hye Gyeong damages our image,

969
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,730
I believe this is the best decision I've ever made in my life,
