3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Please follow my instruction.</font>

4
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:11,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Place your hands forward.</font>

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Let your knees be parallel to your hands.</font>

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Make your body form a right angle.</font>

7
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:17,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Next,</font>

8
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,979
<font color=#FFFF00>stretch your hands forward.</font>

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Stretch your hip backward.</font>

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Let your chest almost touch the floor.</font>

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Put your left hand under your right hand.</font>

12
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Relax your head.</font>

13
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Raise your right hand toward the ceiling.</font>

14
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo,</font>

15
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,249
<font color=#FFFF00>- don't you feel tired? - Not at all.</font>

16
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe it's because I'm in my last month of the pregnancy.</font>

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Just standing up makes me out of breath.</font>

18
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:52,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin has to help me stand up with his hands.</font>

19
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,419
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out...</font>

20
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:58,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fit for pregnancy.</font>

21
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Neither do I get swollen nor I have morning sickness.</font>

22
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I would be totally fine even if I have 5 more babies.</font>

23
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:08,349
<font color=#FFFF00>You're amazing.</font>

24
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:17,219
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with my age</font>

25
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,179
<font color=#FFFF00>My age is just good enough for getting pregnant</font>

26
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, Steamed Bun's dad,</font>

27
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been thinking...</font>

28
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,319
<font color=#FFFF00>How about you and I...</font>

29
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:37,479
<font color=#FFFF00>become in-laws later?</font>

30
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,879
<font color=#FFFF00>In-laws?</font>

31
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,879
<font color=#FFFF00>If my Overcome is a daughter,</font>

32
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,019
<font color=#FFFF00>- and Pancakes, right? - No, Steamed Bun.</font>

33
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. If Steamed Bun is a son, let's get them to marry each other.</font>

34
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,249
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I think...</font>

35
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,479
<font color=#FFFF00>our children have the same destiny.</font>

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,479
<font color=#FFFF00>See? You and I are just like blood brothers.</font>

37
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,819
<font color=#FFFF00>They will be born on the similar dates.</font>

38
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,249
<font color=#FFFF00>They will be a fantastic couple.</font>

39
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying...</font>

40
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:02,279
<font color=#FFFF00>that I should marry off my son to a girl who resembles Sun Nyeo?</font>

41
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. Why?</font>

42
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I'd love to,</font>

43
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:09,519
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't ask Steamed Bun his opinion now, that's why.</font>

44
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,419
<font color=#FFFF00>What makes you hesitate?</font>

45
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo has strong ability to maintain her livelihood,</font>

46
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,979
<font color=#FFFF00>she is healthy and strong in body and mind...</font>

47
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,289
<font color=#FFFF00>and she has a good personality.</font>

48
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,549
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing lacking.</font>

49
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you being haughty?</font>

50
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,949
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll tell Sun Nyeo.</font>

51
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,979
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like that.</font>

52
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,219
<font color=#FFFF00>The babies are not even born yet,</font>

53
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,819
<font color=#FFFF00>and you're talking about in-laws, so I was embarrassed.</font>

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,319
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, why is the foetus name...</font>

55
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,789
<font color=#FFFF00>"Overcome"?</font>

56
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

57
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,949
<font color=#FFFF00>overcame the andropause which is called a man's death...</font>

58
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,619
<font color=#FFFF00>and went against nature and had a baby.</font>

59
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,449
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I named the foetus Overcome...</font>

60
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,279
<font color=#FFFF00>to overcome. Overcome!</font>

61
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,449
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

62
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It had a profound meaning.</font>

63
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,949
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm tired. - Honey!</font>

64
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful. How was the exercise?</font>

65
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:00,649
<font color=#FFFF00>I was tired and lost my breath...</font>

66
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,949
<font color=#FFFF00>because I'm in my last month of pregnancy,</font>

67
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,919
<font color=#FFFF00>but Sun Nyeo was very good at it.</font>

68
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:08,919
<font color=#FFFF00>You worried that you were the oldest among the mothers.</font>

69
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,379
<font color=#FFFF00>As I already told Yun Shil,</font>

70
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,349
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess I'm fit for pregnancy.</font>

71
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:16,649
<font color=#FFFF00>I was not tired at all. I had no problem.</font>

72
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,149
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - Yes?</font>

73
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,949
<font color=#FFFF00>After I give birth to Overcome,</font>

74
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,819
<font color=#FFFF00>how about having one more baby a year apart? All right?</font>

75
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,219
<font color=#FFFF00>- Great. - Good.</font>

76
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome.</font>

77
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's have a baby a year apart too. All right?</font>

78
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,049
<font color=#FFFF00>No thanks.</font>

79
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Having Steamed Bun is enough for me.</font>

80
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,479
<font color=#FFFF00>We made a promise to have at least three kids.</font>

81
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:41,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know having a baby would be so hard back then.</font>

82
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- What about a year apart? - No way.</font>

83
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,879
<font color=#FFFF00>It's good now. Have a seat.</font>

84
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:55,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Slowly.</font>

85
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,719
<font color=#FFFF00>There you go.</font>

86
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:00,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see.</font>

87
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's your book.</font>

88
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:05,979
<font color=#FFFF00>I envy Yun Shil.</font>

89
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,419
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying. I really envy you.</font>

90
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, I will definitely meet a man like you and get married to him.</font>

91
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, do you think a man like him is common?</font>

92
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:16,679
<font color=#FFFF00>- What kind of man am I? - You're handsome,</font>

93
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,679
<font color=#FFFF00>competent and sweet. How nice!</font>

94
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,549
<font color=#FFFF00>You're like a hero in a comic book.</font>

95
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:23,949
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a man of my dream.</font>

96
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hear that? I'm that kind of a man.</font>

97
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,419
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You can go now.</font>

98
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,479
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

99
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't work too hard.</font>

100
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Call me right away if you feel anything strange. Okay?</font>

101
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,549
<font color=#FFFF00>See you.</font>

102
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:40,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take care of Yun Shil.</font>

103
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:41,379
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sure. - We will.</font>

104
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,119
<font color=#FFFF00>- Bye. - Bye.</font>

105
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,319
<font color=#FFFF00>An airmail came for you.</font>

106
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Airmail?</font>

107
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:07,919
<font color=#FFFF00>It's an invitation.</font>

108
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,319
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Madam Ko.</font>

109
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,349
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been coming by every day...</font>

110
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,219
<font color=#FFFF00>since Ms Min got discharged from the hospital.</font>

111
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I came here as soon as I left the store after my shift.</font>

112
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Ta-da. I brought chicken soup today.</font>

113
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,319
<font color=#FFFF00>There.</font>

114
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:36,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, it's much better than most short rib soups I've had.</font>

115
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,949
<font color=#FFFF00>The owner of the store is such a good cook.</font>

116
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Try it. Come on.</font>

117
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,619
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's okay. I'll eat it later.</font>

118
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:46,349
<font color=#FFFF00>When are you going to eat it then?</font>

119
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Just eat it when I'm here.</font>

120
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you bugging me so much?</font>

121
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:59,179
<font color=#FFFF00>How is it? Isn't it so good?</font>

122
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not bad.</font>

123
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said, the owner is such a great cook.</font>

124
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,079
<font color=#FFFF00>She's literally sweeping up all the money in the neighbourhood now.</font>

125
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Getting paid is obviously good,</font>

126
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,119
<font color=#FFFF00>but being able to take leftover dishes home for free is awesome.</font>

127
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,119
<font color=#FFFF00>What does that mean? Is this also one of the leftovers?</font>

128
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:19,049
<font color=#FFFF00>What? No.</font>

129
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not. I bought it because it's for you.</font>

130
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,079
<font color=#FFFF00>You cranky girl.</font>

131
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat it while it's still warm.</font>

132
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get sick again from malnutrition.</font>

133
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. Try this too.</font>

134
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:59,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. You got hand dermatitis because of me.</font>

135
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it your fault?</font>

136
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I got it because I love doing housework.</font>

137
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Still.</font>

138
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've at least helped you with washing dishes.</font>

139
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you wouldn't have gotten hand dermatitis.</font>

140
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,519
<font color=#FFFF00>You would've broken a bunch of plates though.</font>

141
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:12,749
<font color=#FFFF00>A bunch of plates?</font>

142
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:15,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you making fun of me for being clueless on doing housework?</font>

143
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm not making fun of you.</font>

144
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm stronger than you, so cleaning is easier for me.</font>

145
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm also more used to cooking at home,</font>

146
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,819
<font color=#FFFF00>so I want you to feel comfortable with me taking care of housework.</font>

147
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, let me help you with washing dishes from time to time.</font>

148
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see. I can't do that because you'll break the dishes.</font>

149
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,449
<font color=#FFFF00>What would be good?</font>

150
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:40,549
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll let you hang, fold and put away clean laundry.</font>

151
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Deal.</font>

152
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won.</font>

153
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang.</font>

154
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me.</font>

155
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Mum is here again. Goodness.</font>

156
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

157
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mother.</font>

158
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, I thought I should stop by on my way home.</font>

159
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you guys had dinner?</font>

160
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. What about you?</font>

161
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:15,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I stopped by to see Hyo Joo and ate with her.</font>

162
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,549
<font color=#FFFF00>It's getting late. You should've just gone home.</font>

163
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come here?</font>

164
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to go home because I get bored...</font>

165
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,119
<font color=#FFFF00>and claustrophobic at that tiny place.</font>

166
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,479
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted to play cards with Tae Yang before heading home.</font>

167
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, we're newlyweds.</font>

168
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,349
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

169
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,319
<font color=#FFFF00>You can just go home and play cards with Hyo Sang and Ji Yun.</font>

170
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep coming by our place and being a nuisance?</font>

171
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Playing cards with those two is no fun.</font>

172
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to play with someone who is compatible with my style of play.</font>

173
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Those guys bore me.</font>

174
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:48,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, how can you keep dropping in on newlyweds like this?</font>

175
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be like that to Mother.</font>

176
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:55,079
<font color=#FFFF00>You just heard what Tae Yang said, right?</font>

177
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,189
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't be so rude to me.</font>

178
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't I right, Tae Yang?</font>

179
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:01,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mother. Shall I bring out the blanket?</font>

180
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Sounds great. Let's do this!</font>

181
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's use the one I bought recently.</font>

182
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,279
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - That one is great.</font>

183
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,549
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing now?</font>

184
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:29,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Master taught me how to sew, you know.</font>

185
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:32,189
<font color=#FFFF00>It was fun, so I wanted to practice at home.</font>

186
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,549
<font color=#FFFF00>You find sewing fun?</font>

187
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Honey, have a look at this.</font>

188
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,219
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the padding stitch technique.</font>

189
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Using these stitches instead of adhesives...</font>

190
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,819
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to secure the lining when you make a suit,</font>

191
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,079
<font color=#FFFF00>prevents distortion and makes it fit better as well.</font>

192
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Sang.</font>

193
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you lost your mind?</font>

194
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,879
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you use sewing for? Why did you bring that home?</font>

195
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,949
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

196
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm learning how to make suits.</font>

197
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin must've wanted me to learn this.</font>

198
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet that's why he made me work at the shop.</font>

199
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,149
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

200
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, observing everyone at the shop...</font>

201
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,779
<font color=#FFFF00>and learning sewing and tailoring there has made me...</font>

202
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,819
<font color=#FFFF00>realise that I shouldn't think of suits just as a way of making money.</font>

203
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at this. I made this curtain too. Isn't it nice?</font>

204
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,549
<font color=#FFFF00>If anything needs to be ironed or has buttons that are falling off,</font>

205
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:28,079
<font color=#FFFF00>bring it to me. I can take care of it.</font>

206
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:30,919
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is wrong with him? - Sorry? What?</font>

207
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing. I'm just speechless.</font>

208
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,649
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - It's nothing.</font>

209
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Dear all merchants at the market.</font>

210
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. I'm Candidate Number Two, Bok Sun Nyeo.</font>

211
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,149
<font color=#FFFF00>First, let me tell you a little bit about myself.</font>

212
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Starting with my great-grandmother,</font>

213
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:50,819
<font color=#FFFF00>every generation of my family has worked at this market.</font>

214
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,579
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been the legacy of my family for four generations in a row.</font>

215
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I was born and raised at this market.</font>

216
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Please think of me as your daughter...</font>

217
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,319
<font color=#FFFF00>and place your trust in me.</font>

218
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:07,179
<font color=#FFFF00>If I'm elected as the chairwoman of the market committee,</font>

219
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure I dedicate myself solely...</font>

220
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,679
<font color=#FFFF00>to you and your continued success...</font>

221
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,179
<font color=#FFFF00>and promise you my loyalty!</font>

222
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,619
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't you think this is too much? - Why?</font>

223
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,049
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to be focusing on our baby's prenatal education.</font>

224
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,219
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you be practicing that?</font>

225
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Yelling like that...</font>

226
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,079
<font color=#FFFF00>will stress our baby out so much.</font>

227
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Listening to my speech in my belly...</font>

228
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:32,549
<font color=#FFFF00>will make our baby grow into a very eloquent speaker.</font>

229
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,879
<font color=#FFFF00>From a lawyer, prosecutor and judge to an announcer,</font>

230
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,549
<font color=#FFFF00>she'll be able to have any job she wants.</font>

231
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,319
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll have so much on your plate after she's born.</font>

232
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really have to run in the election?</font>

233
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,479
<font color=#FFFF00>I've decided to run in the election...</font>

234
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:48,379
<font color=#FFFF00>for our daughter's future.</font>

235
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Revitalisation of traditional markets...</font>

236
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:54,019
<font color=#FFFF00>will ensure a brighter future for our daughter.</font>

237
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:57,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever. I know that you're doing it because you want the title.</font>

238
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think anyone can run in the election? Know your place.</font>

239
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,019
<font color=#FFFF00>- "Know your place"? - I wasn't talking about you.</font>

240
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:03,549
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

241
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing. Never mind.</font>

242
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:05,949
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

243
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm not totally happy with my live performance today.</font>

244
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung, is it true that you're married?</font>

245
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Why have you been lying to your fans?</font>

246
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Is your agency really owned by a daughter of a business tycoon...</font>

247
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,049
<font color=#FFFF00>who ran away to the States 15 years ago?</font>

248
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that mean you're married to her?</font>

249
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,879
<font color=#FFFF00>No, my wife is...</font>

250
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,619
<font color=#FFFF00>my manager here, Lee Dong Sook.</font>

251
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I sincerely apologise to my fans for not being honest with them.</font>

252
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:41,279
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not Tae Pyung's fault.</font>

253
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted him to become as popular as he used to be,</font>

254
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,179
<font color=#FFFF00>so I told him to lie.</font>

255
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,349
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's all my fault.</font>

256
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:50,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I sincerely apologise.</font>

257
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Tae Pyung.</font>

258
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:59,849
<font color=#FFFF00>I made you become a liar.</font>

259
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,649
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not your fault at all.</font>

260
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I've had many opportunities to fix it,</font>

261
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,379
<font color=#FFFF00>but I've been willingly keeping my mouth shut.</font>

262
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,179
<font color=#FFFF00>What should we do now?</font>

263
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Popularity is...</font>

264
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,919
<font color=#FFFF00>as fleeting as the wind.</font>

265
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I shall start again from scratch.</font>

266
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,449
<font color=#FFFF00>I have nothing to worry about as I have you and Da Jeong.</font>

267
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,019
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to act like I'm single just to become popular again.</font>

268
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:29,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want to spend time with you and Da Jeong comfortably.</font>

269
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:32,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I prefer that much more than regaining popularity.</font>

270
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Pyung.</font>

271
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome. Overcome.</font>

272
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:52,019
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you had a TV show today. Did it go well?</font>

273
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,449
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, of course. - I want to go in.</font>

274
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you two have a fight?</font>

275
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,579
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

276
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why is she so downcast?</font>

277
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,449
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess she's tired.</font>

278
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,319
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, why are you jumping rope in the middle of the night?</font>

279
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll become a dad soon. I need to stay fit, don't you think?</font>

280
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome.</font>

281
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:19,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome your midlife crisis and attain happiness</font>

282
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,119
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still awake?</font>

283
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Yun Shil's exam is just around the corner, you know.</font>

284
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,319
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter with those two mums-to-be?</font>

285
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Both Steamed Bun's mum and Overcome's mum.</font>

286
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,449
<font color=#FFFF00>What is their problem?</font>

287
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Have they forgotten how old they are? One wants to become a student,</font>

288
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,279
<font color=#FFFF00>and the other wants the chairwoman title. What's wrong with them?</font>

289
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,549
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying.</font>

290
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,649
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sam Do. - Yes?</font>

291
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of your andropause, you've been throwing hissy fits...</font>

292
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,719
<font color=#FFFF00>and have been complaining about feeling tired and weak.</font>

293
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,349
<font color=#FFFF00>How exactly did you manage to conceive your baby?</font>

294
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:53,949
<font color=#FFFF00>One day, Sun Nyeo took me to a spring...</font>

295
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:57,179
<font color=#FFFF00>and made me jog up and down steps and do the hula hoop.</font>

296
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It was our project to overcome andropause,</font>

297
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:00,419
<font color=#FFFF00>and it worked.</font>

298
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:03,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo is amazing.</font>

299
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you...</font>

300
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,549
<font color=#FFFF00>make Da Jeong an older sister?</font>

301
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Start your own project to overcome andropause.</font>

302
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I?</font>

303
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too old to consider making Da Jeong an older sister.</font>

304
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it.</font>

305
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,749
<font color=#FFFF00>I should go to that mineral spring.</font>

306
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,579
<font color=#FFFF00>To make Steamed Bun number two?</font>

307
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

308
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:25,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed Bun, Grilled Bun and Pancake Bun.</font>

309
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Pancake Bun sounds odd.</font>

310
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,949
<font color=#FFFF00>What other buns are there? Fried buns?</font>

311
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin's a true patriot.</font>

312
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Our population's falling.</font>

313
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome. Overcome.</font>

314
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously.</font>

315
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,519
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

316
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. Mum.</font>

317
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,519
<font color=#FFFF00>What now?</font>

318
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home.</font>

319
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Why now? It's too early in the morning.</font>

320
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go later on in the morning.</font>

321
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Get the hint.</font>

322
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:03,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep intruding into our newlywed space?</font>

323
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:04,879
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

324
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,879
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say that to your mum?</font>

325
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,179
<font color=#FFFF00>That really hurt.</font>

326
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,549
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you sleep well? - Yes.</font>

327
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,949
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you sleep well? - I did.</font>

328
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:19,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think...</font>

329
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,849
<font color=#FFFF00>it's a nuisance that I keep coming by?</font>

330
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Not at all.</font>

331
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Breakfast is ready. Wash up and eat.</font>

332
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

333
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,279
<font color=#FFFF00>I said go home.</font>

334
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

335
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go after breakfast.</font>

336
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang told me to stay for breakfast.</font>

337
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I really think we should...</font>

338
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,519
<font color=#FFFF00>- find my mum a boyfriend. - What?</font>

339
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Are there any nice teachers at your school?</font>

340
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,119
<font color=#FFFF00>My mum looks quite young.</font>

341
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,779
<font color=#FFFF00>She can date a man 10 years her junior...</font>

342
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,419
<font color=#FFFF00>and maybe five years her senior.</font>

343
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:06,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you smiling? I'm serious.</font>

344
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,249
<font color=#FFFF00>What gave you that idea?</font>

345
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum keeps coming by all the time...</font>

346
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,619
<font color=#FFFF00>and ruins our newlywed life.</font>

347
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,719
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't get to kiss me this morning.</font>

348
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,479
<font color=#FFFF00>It was so upsetting.</font>

349
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Will that do?</font>

350
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly,</font>

351
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,079
<font color=#FFFF00>are there any nice teachers?</font>

352
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,389
<font color=#FFFF00>How about the headmaster?</font>

353
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:38,149
<font color=#FFFF00>No way, he's too old.</font>

354
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:39,619
<font color=#FFFF00>He's young.</font>

355
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,679
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is he? - Yes.</font>

356
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:41,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Then yes.</font>

357
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:44,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's warped. - Oh, you're right.</font>

358
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning, everyone.</font>

359
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:46,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning. Hello, Yun Shil.</font>

360
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome, both of you.</font>

361
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Walk slowly, now sit down.</font>

362
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Slowly, slowly.</font>

363
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't strain yourself.</font>

364
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

365
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:59,889
<font color=#FFFF00>You're practically her servant.</font>

366
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,719
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to be. Do you like the work?</font>

367
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,249
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

368
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,389
<font color=#FFFF00>He's gotten better. He even does things he wasn't told to do.</font>

369
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:08,819
<font color=#FFFF00>- Master. - What?</font>

370
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay? I can't believe you complimented me.</font>

371
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,949
<font color=#FFFF00>What? How dare you.</font>

372
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,349
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why I always end up scolding you.</font>

373
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll call you back to Meesa soon.</font>

374
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang in there a while longer.</font>

375
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,249
<font color=#FFFF00>What you learn here will come in useful later on.</font>

376
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:24,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope so.</font>

377
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:27,119
<font color=#FFFF00>How about a coffee while you're here?</font>

378
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you all want one?</font>

379
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,419
<font color=#FFFF00>- I would. - I'll make it.</font>

380
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,719
<font color=#FFFF00>- No. - No way.</font>

381
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay still, Ma'am.</font>

382
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I can take it from here.</font>

383
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,449
<font color=#FFFF00>What got into him? He's obedient all of a sudden.</font>

384
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:42,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

385
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:43,819
<font color=#FFFF00>(Sun Nyeo's Side Dishes)</font>

386
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:44,819
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

387
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,479
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're late. - You're going all out.</font>

388
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:51,249
<font color=#FFFF00>People would think you're running for congress.</font>

389
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:54,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to represent the merchants here...</font>

390
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,779
<font color=#FFFF00>enough to wear a sash?</font>

391
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:57,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Back when I was in Daejeon,</font>

392
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,949
<font color=#FFFF00>every time I tried to become the union president,</font>

393
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:03,019
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost to the opposition by just a few votes.</font>

394
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:06,079
<font color=#FFFF00>This time, I'm determined to become president.</font>

395
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,249
<font color=#FFFF00>You should focus on your business.</font>

396
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you want to win a title?</font>

397
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Once someone has money,</font>

398
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,549
<font color=#FFFF00>they want power as well.</font>

399
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone might think...</font>

400
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,219
<font color=#FFFF00>you're earning a fortune by selling food.</font>

401
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Put on a sash.</font>

402
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,889
<font color=#FFFF00>- Me too? - Or you can quit today.</font>

403
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,449
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate my job. Fine.</font>

404
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:29,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Nyeo.</font>

405
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

406
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

407
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:35,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- To help you get elected. - What a mess.</font>

408
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for coming. I won't forget this.</font>

409
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,919
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine.</font>

410
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm paid in advance.</font>

411
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you accept payment in side dishes?</font>

412
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Or eat whatever you... Okay, okay.</font>

413
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,249
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a tough customer.</font>

414
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:53,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

415
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Put it back.</font>

416
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:56,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it too little?</font>

417
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Be generous.</font>

418
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,249
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here you go. - I said it's fine.</font>

419
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:01,619
<font color=#FFFF00>We're family.</font>

420
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:04,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want all of it then?</font>

421
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,579

429
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,219

443
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,949
<font color=#FFFF00>- Number 2, Number 2. - I need your support!</font>

444
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Put that there.</font>

445
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:03,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- If not, use another ruler. - Okay.</font>

446
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,749
<font color=#FFFF00>- Welcome. - Hello.</font>

447
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:12,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Nina Song and I work at the Italian Embassy.</font>

448
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Our ambassador wanted to visit,</font>

449
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:17,519
<font color=#FFFF00>so I brought him here.</font>

450
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,519
<font color=#FFFF00>He's... He's an ambassador.</font>

451
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,549
<font color=#FFFF00>An ambassador?</font>

452
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:22,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

453
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:25,619
<font color=#FFFF00>To what do we owe this pleasure, Mr Ambassador?</font>

454
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I wanted to see for myself...</font>

455
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,749
<font color=#FFFF00>how the partner of our great Italian brand...</font>

456
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:30,949
<font color=#FFFF00>of Tonelli looks like.</font>

457
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm curious because I was told that...</font>

458
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,919
<font color=#FFFF00>the tradition of this place goes back 100 years.</font>

459
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:37,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

460
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Well,</font>

461
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:43,549
<font color=#FFFF00>I can still feel the historic ambiance of this place.</font>

462
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:47,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. It means a lot to us that you think that way.</font>

463
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Chief Designer Gianni...</font>

464
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,119
<font color=#FFFF00>spoke very highly about your suits.</font>

465
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,619
<font color=#FFFF00>So, I would like to have a suit for myself and while we're at it,</font>

466
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:59,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I would like a double jacket and a coat which goes along with it.</font>

467
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, hey. What did he say?</font>

468
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,679
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants a suit, a double jacket...</font>

469
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,379
<font color=#FFFF00>and a coat made.</font>

470
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,549
<font color=#FFFF00>- All three? - Yes.</font>

471
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,819
<font color=#FFFF00>We're very backlogged at the moment.</font>

472
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,049
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think we can make three items for one customer.</font>

473
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,449
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our Master Tailor Mr Sam Do Bae.</font>

474
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:24,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Unfortunately at the moment we're currently swamped with orders,</font>

475
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,519
<font color=#FFFF00>so unfortunately, we made a rule...</font>

476
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,949
<font color=#FFFF00>to only take one order per customer.</font>

477
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,079
<font color=#FFFF00>But the ambassador came here in person.</font>

478
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you could take two orders then?</font>

479
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

480
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,579
<font color=#FFFF00>he can order a suit.</font>

481
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Since it's getting warmer, the coat can wait.</font>

482
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,919
<font color=#FFFF00>In return, tell him that I'll make...</font>

483
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,479
<font color=#FFFF00>the best quality suit for him possible.</font>

484
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Geum, Ms Geum.</font>

485
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:59,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know who was just here?</font>

486
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Who was here?</font>

487
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:03,019
<font color=#FFFF00>The ambassador from Italy...</font>

488
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,549
<font color=#FFFF00>ordered a suit from me.</font>

489
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:06,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Bae Sam Do just made it big.</font>

490
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true? Congratulations.</font>

491
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,619
<font color=#FFFF00>He took the measurements,</font>

492
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:13,579
<font color=#FFFF00>and he didn't tremble. He was very professional.</font>

493
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,249
<font color=#FFFF00>- You were so cool. - I'm shaking now.</font>

494
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:17,379
<font color=#FFFF00>- Me too. - Intern.</font>

495
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- Your English was great. Well done. - Really?</font>

496
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:20,379
<font color=#FFFF00>You did it! Congratulations.</font>

497
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:30,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go to Belgium.</font>

498
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Belgium?</font>

499
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:32,819
<font color=#FFFF00>What for?</font>

500
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,149
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd sent my portfolio to the Royal Academy,</font>

501
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,319
<font color=#FFFF00>and they offered me...</font>

502
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,579
<font color=#FFFF00>a place as a researcher and artist.</font>

503
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:43,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I can study again...</font>

504
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:45,719
<font color=#FFFF00>and study European fashion.</font>

505
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:48,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stay a few years.</font>

506
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,579
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll travel a lot too.</font>

507
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,649
<font color=#FFFF00>I see. When will you leave?</font>

508
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,949
<font color=#FFFF00>On Friday.</font>

509
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:56,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought the ticket on the way here.</font>

510
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:58,449
<font color=#FFFF00>So soon?</font>

511
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:00,949
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing for me here.</font>

512
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you,</font>

513
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,249
<font color=#FFFF00>I regained the freedom to go where I want.</font>

514
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

515
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,179
<font color=#FFFF00>You were hurt.</font>

516
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,649
<font color=#FFFF00>For whatever reason that was, I'm sorry it happened.</font>

517
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:17,779
<font color=#FFFF00>If we talk about hurt,</font>

518
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:20,279
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pretty sure I caused you a lot too.</font>

519
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:24,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Your wife.</font>

520
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:28,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard she's due soon.</font>

521
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

522
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,619
<font color=#FFFF00>This must be...</font>

523
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,249
<font color=#FFFF00>the happiest time in your life.</font>

524
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:43,379
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope...</font>

525
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,519
<font color=#FFFF00>you get to experience this happiness.</font>

526
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I should.</font>

527
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

528
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Come in.</font>

529
00:24:58,779 --> 00:24:59,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

530
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,579
<font color=#FFFF00>What brought you here? You didn't tell me you would come.</font>

531
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:13,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Joo, what brought you here?</font>

532
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to ask you a favour.</font>

533
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,449
<font color=#FFFF00>What favour do you want to ask us?</font>

534
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat first. Sit down.</font>

535
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,679
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what do you want to ask us?</font>

536
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:30,949
<font color=#FFFF00>On Friday,</font>

537
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving to Belgium.</font>

538
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Belgium?</font>

539
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you going there?</font>

540
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll study fashion...</font>

541
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,279
<font color=#FFFF00>and travel around.</font>

542
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,249
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back after several years.</font>

543
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I really envy you.</font>

544
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,679
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

545
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,179
<font color=#FFFF00>are you going alone?</font>

546
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,249
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going alone. Who would I go with?</font>

547
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:01,819
<font color=#FFFF00>So I was wondering...</font>

548
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you stay in Pyeongchang-dong house while I'm away?</font>

549
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,319
<font color=#FFFF00>- You mean us? - You mean us?</font>

550
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Don't you want to?</font>

551
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

552
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,349
<font color=#FFFF00>I dozed off again.</font>

553
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,049
<font color=#FFFF00>You were not dozing off. You were sleeping.</font>

554
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,449
<font color=#FFFF00>You drooled a lot.</font>

555
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:36,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

556
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Lie down here and sleep comfortably.</font>

557
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:43,749
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have a lot to study.</font>

558
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:48,249
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why I get so sleepy nowadays.</font>

559
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:50,349
<font color=#FFFF00>It's worse than when I was in my early pregnancy.</font>

560
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:53,649
<font color=#FFFF00>What if you doze off during the exam?</font>

561
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:56,419
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm serious, and you're making fun of me.</font>

562
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,879
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

563
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,549
<font color=#FFFF00>To arouse you from sleep. Are you awake now?</font>

564
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you? Shall I do it one more time?</font>

565
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,719
<font color=#FFFF00>No, thank you.</font>

566
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed bun.</font>

567
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:19,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad totally fell for Mum's charm which surprised me.</font>

568
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:23,249
<font color=#FFFF00>You should meet a woman like Mum when you grow up, all right?</font>

569
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:25,219
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

570
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,549
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, Dad.</font>

571
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:30,579
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you hear that? He answered. - Yes, he answered.</font>

572
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,819
<font color=#FFFF00>He said, "All right, Dad."</font>

573
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,819
<font color=#FFFF00>You might be greedy for a title,</font>

574
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:39,819
<font color=#FFFF00>but you will deliver a baby soon.</font>

575
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you have to join in the election for the president?</font>

576
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,649
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not young. You're an old mum.</font>

577
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:49,479
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very dangerous to go around for the election campaign.</font>

578
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome inside you must be very tired.</font>

579
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,949
<font color=#FFFF00>They say a mum's pain is a child's pain.</font>

580
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:58,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were not nagging for a while, and there you go again.</font>

581
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Haven't you overcome the andropause?</font>

582
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I did overcome it.</font>

583
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,319
<font color=#FFFF00>If a husband meddles with...</font>

584
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,749
<font color=#FFFF00>what a wife does on every single detail,</font>

585
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:13,679
<font color=#FFFF00>she can't do her work outside.</font>

586
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:15,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you answering me?</font>

587
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:18,679
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

588
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,649
<font color=#FFFF00>That feels good.</font>

589
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

590
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I got a phone call from Mum.</font>

591
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Joo is leaving to Belgium.</font>

592
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:42,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Belgium?</font>

593
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:45,479
<font color=#FFFF00>She majored in design.</font>

594
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:49,049
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a good opportunity for her to study there.</font>

595
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,019
<font color=#FFFF00>I should be happy for her,</font>

596
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:53,749
<font color=#FFFF00>but I feel little strange.</font>

597
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:01,049
<font color=#FFFF00>I just became familiar with her.</font>

598
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,749
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried if she leaves now, we could be awkward when we meet again.</font>

599
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,049
<font color=#FFFF00>The mental distance is more important...</font>

600
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,919
<font color=#FFFF00>than the physical distance.</font>

601
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,949
<font color=#FFFF00>You can call her often and write her from time to time.</font>

602
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:19,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum and Hyo Sang will live in Hyo Joo's house.</font>

603
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:22,179
<font color=#FFFF00>She said we can live in her current house.</font>

604
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Will they live in Pyeongchang-dong?</font>

605
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:27,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Hyo Joo told them to live in her house.</font>

606
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to live in Pyeongchang-dong house?</font>

607
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,819
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I like it here.</font>

608
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,949
<font color=#FFFF00>It's our first home.</font>

609
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,779
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to enjoy the newlywed life more in this house.</font>

610
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:52,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Then we should sell the house Mother is now living.</font>

611
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,019
<font color=#FFFF00>This is great.</font>

612
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,349
<font color=#FFFF00>- Aren't you hungry? - I'm hungry.</font>

613
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I cook something for you?</font>

614
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:17,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to eat instant cup noodles.</font>

615
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,749
<font color=#FFFF00>How many instant cup noodles do you want?</font>

616
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:20,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I want two.</font>

617
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,579
<font color=#FFFF00>- Good luck on your exam! - We will be cheering for you!</font>

618
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:33,119
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a cup of coffee. - Good luck!</font>

619
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,149
<font color=#FFFF00>- Good luck on your exam! - Good luck on your exam!</font>

620
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:44,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get nervous. Take it easy.</font>

621
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,649
<font color=#FFFF00>If you feel something strange or tired during the test,</font>

622
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:49,119
<font color=#FFFF00>don't endure it. Tell the test official right away.</font>

623
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,249
<font color=#FFFF00>I get it.</font>

624
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Shiny Eyes can do it. Go for it!</font>

625
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:54,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Go for it!</font>

626
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,119
<font color=#FFFF00>(Korean Language, Na Yun Shil)</font>

627
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Next is candidate number two, Bok Sun Nyeo.</font>

646
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

647
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I think the baby is coming.</font>

648
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:17,049
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my. - It hurts. Bae Sam Do!</font>

649
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:19,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Bring Sam Do here. Bae Sam Do.</font>

650
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,949
<font color=#FFFF00>(Delivery Room)</font>

651
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:25,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's the guardian for Na Yun Shil?</font>

652
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's me.</font>

653
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:29,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations. On 21:03,</font>

00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:35,949

<font color=#FFFF00>Are mum and baby healthy?</font>

659
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Both mum and baby are healthy.</font>

660
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:50,649
<font color=#FFFF00>She delivered a girl on 21:04.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations.</font>

662
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

663
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,849
<font color=#FFFF00>We became dads!</font>

664
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Sun Nyeo deliver a girl and Yun Shil a boy?</font>

665
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:17,649
<font color=#FFFF00>That's great.</font>

666
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,679
<font color=#FFFF00>How are the mums?</font>

667
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you call Dad?</font>

668
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:23,179
<font color=#FFFF00>That's good.</font>

669
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, Dong Jin. Bye.</font>

670
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:29,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Uncle have a son and Sam Do a girl?</font>

671
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, they did.</font>

672
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:34,019
<font color=#FFFF00>The babies must be very cute.</font>

673
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, do you have a plan to make me a sibling?</font>

674
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd love to.</font>

675
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,249
<font color=#FFFF00>However, your mum says she won't.</font>

676
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:44,819
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do it.</font>

677
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:46,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't laugh.</font>

678
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,319
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing standing in line?</font>

679
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:59,619
<font color=#FFFF00>We've been waiting for you to see you out.</font>

680
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you pretending to be a happy family or what?</font>

681
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:03,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it too much?</font>

682
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:07,579
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going far. We should see you out.</font>

683
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get snippy with anyone in Belgium.</font>

684
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care of yourself.</font>

685
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't skip meals so that you don't get malnourished.</font>

686
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I get it.</font>

687
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll miss you a lot.</font>

688
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:34,379
<font color=#FFFF00>You can visit me if you miss me. Don't be such a drama queen.</font>

689
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:35,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I do that?</font>

690
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:37,719
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay for your airline tickets.</font>

691
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:39,919
<font color=#FFFF00>You can all come for vacation.</font>

692
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a safe trip.</font>

693
00:34:52,749 --> 00:34:53,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Once you're there,</font>

694
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,619
<font color=#FFFF00>if you feel lonely and worn down,</font>

695
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,749
<font color=#FFFF00>don't fight it and come back.</font>

696
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Remember that this is your home.</font>

697
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

698
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:12,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

699
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:16,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you...</font>

700
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,789
<font color=#FFFF00>just call me "mum"?</font>

701
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:24,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you just say "mum"...</font>

702
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:26,449
<font color=#FFFF00>and not "stepmum"?</font>

703
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,719
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a bit too old...</font>

704
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,849
<font color=#FFFF00>to be my new mum.</font>

705
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:36,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I'd never get to hear you call me that.</font>

706
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:41,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Hyo Joo.</font>

707
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Now...</font>

708
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:45,789
<font color=#FFFF00>I can die in peace.</font>

709
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that.</font>

710
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,149
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll have a good time.</font>

711
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Look after the home until I get back.</font>

712
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care.</font>

713
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I...</font>

714
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:01,619
<font color=#FFFF00>see you off at the airport?</font>

715
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,949
<font color=#FFFF00>No thanks.</font>

716
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won and Tae Yang's enough.</font>

717
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,579
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still so cold-hearted.</font>

718
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:11,749
<font color=#FFFF00>- Call as soon as you get there. - I will.</font>

719
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:13,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

720
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:23,549
<font color=#FFFF00>See you.</font>

721
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:33,349
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll take her safely to the airport.</font>

722
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:35,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Get some rest.</font>

723
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,549
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll see her off.</font>

724
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:38,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

725
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, I know it was hard work.</font>

726
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:56,449
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw our baby a while ago.</font>

727
00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:59,789
<font color=#FFFF00>She's beautiful and looks just like you.</font>

728
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:01,249
<font color=#FFFF00>She looks like me?</font>

729
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,879
<font color=#FFFF00>She can't.</font>

730
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,479
<font color=#FFFF00>She must look like you.</font>

731
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,149
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

732
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Half her looks are from me and half are from you.</font>

733
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,289
<font color=#FFFF00>She's definitely ours.</font>

734
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:16,049
<font color=#FFFF00>- Was it painful? - I thought I was going to die.</font>

735
00:37:16,149 --> 00:37:18,619
<font color=#FFFF00>The whole world turned yellow,</font>

736
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,749
<font color=#FFFF00>and I saw twinkling stars.</font>

737
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it bad for you, Yun Shil?</font>

738
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I saw stars as well.</font>

739
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:28,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you?</font>

740
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:31,879
<font color=#FFFF00>- Great job. - Did you see Steamed Bun?</font>

741
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:32,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

742
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:35,549
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the healthiest and the most handsome baby here.</font>

743
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:39,819
<font color=#FFFF00>For you.</font>

744
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you...</font>

745
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:45,519
<font color=#FFFF00>for having our baby...</font>

746
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:47,649
<font color=#FFFF00>and for being all right.</font>

747
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:48,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

748
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you bring anything?</font>

749
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,649
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too distracted to buy anything. Sorry.</font>

750
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin would have been distracted as well.</font>

751
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:02,219
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. - Hi.</font>

752
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,749
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hi. - Hello.</font>

753
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations.</font>

754
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:11,119
<font color=#FFFF00>You're better than my husband.</font>

755
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:12,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

756
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Tae Yang.</font>

757
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations.</font>

758
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

759
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:20,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

760
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:28,289
<font color=#FFFF00>We wanted to come over as soon as we heard,</font>

761
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,789
<font color=#FFFF00>but we had to drop by the airport.</font>

762
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:32,749
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a son.</font>

763
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, Dong Jin, Yun Shil.</font>

764
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

765
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:38,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why were you at the airport? - My sister...</font>

766
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,149
<font color=#FFFF00>left for Belgium today.</font>

767
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,519
<font color=#FFFF00>She told me to give you this.</font>

768
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,579
<font color=#FFFF00>She said...</font>

769
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,419
<font color=#FFFF00>she's sorry for everything.</font>

770
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank her for us when you talk to her.</font>

771
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:08,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang.</font>

772
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:11,119
<font color=#FFFF00>When will you become a dad?</font>

773
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:13,619
<font color=#FFFF00>He's right.</font>

774
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:17,049
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have a kid when you're still young.</font>

775
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:20,219
<font color=#FFFF00>It's better for the child, and younger mums...</font>

776
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:21,919
<font color=#FFFF00>recover faster.</font>

777
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:24,079
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd love to have a baby.</font>

778
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:28,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Tae Yang, shall we start trying...</font>

779
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,319
<font color=#FFFF00>in earnest tonight?</font>

780
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:33,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that here.</font>

781
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,579
<font color=#FFFF00>I see that...</font>

782
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:40,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo Won's outspoken and frank and totally our type.</font>

783
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Good luck, Hyo Won.</font>

784
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:43,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

785
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:46,319
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll try.</font>

786
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:50,379
<font color=#FFFF00>- Right? - Stop it.</font>

787
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:02,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you in bed?</font>

788
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,549
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't sleep.</font>

789
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you worried about your sister?</font>

790
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,449
<font color=#FFFF00>That and...</font>

791
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,649
<font color=#FFFF00>I was thinking about all sorts of things,</font>

792
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:15,789
<font color=#FFFF00>and I couldn't sleep.</font>

793
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:17,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want some wine?</font>

794
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:20,949
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

795
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:24,519
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll carry you until you fall asleep.</font>

796
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:25,849
<font color=#FFFF00>No, don't.</font>

797
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't fall asleep for a while.</font>

798
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,319
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go to bed.</font>

799
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I'll have to stay up all night as well.</font>

800
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:36,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

801
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:40,119
<font color=#FFFF00>keep your promise.</font>

802
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,479
<font color=#FFFF00>- What promise? - My drawing.</font>

803
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,319
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you'd model for me.</font>

804
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Nude, you mean?</font>

805
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

806
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,319
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't you want to? - It's not that.</font>

807
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:53,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not ready yet.</font>

808
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:56,479
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll let you off this time.</font>

809
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too cold to pose in the nude.</font>

810
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll draw your face instead.</font>

811
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:03,119
<font color=#FFFF00>To celebrate our wedding.</font>

812
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now?</font>

813
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:21,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at me.</font>

814
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,719
<font color=#FFFF00>What was it?</font>

815
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,819
<font color=#FFFF00>All done.</font>

816
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:36,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It's complete, Mr Model.</font>

817
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:42,179
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

818
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:43,949
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks just like me.</font>

819
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,779
<font color=#FFFF00>The Tae Yang on paper is nothing...</font>

820
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:51,649
<font color=#FFFF00>compared to the Tae Yang in front of me.</font>

821
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:53,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it.</font>

822
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

823
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:58,449
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a waste not to show anyone.</font>

824
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's take a photo.</font>

825
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:02,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll show it to my students.</font>

826
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Turn around.</font>

827
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:07,119
<font color=#FFFF00>You want me in the photo?</font>

828
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,219
<font color=#FFFF00>My students want to know what you look like.</font>

829
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not ready for that.</font>

830
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,279
<font color=#FFFF00>I look a total mess.</font>

831
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:16,479
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. You're too pretty.</font>

832
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:17,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be silly.</font>

833
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:23,779
<font color=#FFFF00>1, 2, 3.</font>

834
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:30,419
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm right between two Tae Yangs.</font>

835
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,519
<font color=#FFFF00>You shine.</font>

836
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,349
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't. You shine brightest.</font>

837
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:38,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning.</font>

838
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,279
<font color=#FFFF00>- Business is booming. - It is.</font>

839
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:42,449
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. - Ms President.</font>

840
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,949
<font color=#FFFF00>The alley out there is too dark.</font>

841
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you get the public officials to put a lamppost there.</font>

842
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,219
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will. - Thanks.</font>

843
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,519
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take care. - Bye.</font>

844
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello!</font>

845
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:53,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, President.</font>

846
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:56,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Please get rid of the standing signs and banners that violate the policy.</font>

847
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Things are getting pretty tense here these days, you know.</font>

848
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Officers from the district office will take care of it today.</font>

849
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:03,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Please be patient for just a little longer.</font>

850
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,249
<font color=#FFFF00>That's such great news.</font>

851
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:06,619
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a great day. - Thank you.</font>

852
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,749
<font color=#FFFF00>- My gosh. - You're so adorable.</font>

853
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:16,949
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, look who's here!</font>

854
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed Bun and Overcome.</font>

855
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,419
<font color=#FFFF00>I was getting a bit of cabin fever at home,</font>

856
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,619
<font color=#FFFF00>so I came out for a walk with these two.</font>

857
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:29,149
<font color=#FFFF00>My daughter, have you been a good girl today?</font>

858
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:34,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, my future son-in-law is always so well behaved.</font>

859
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:38,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly. Dong Jin's son is always well behaved,</font>

860
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:40,879
<font color=#FFFF00>but your daughter is so stubborn just like you.</font>

861
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:42,879
<font color=#FFFF00>She's such a troublemaker.</font>

862
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:47,519
<font color=#FFFF00>It's only natural for toddlers to whine and throw fits.</font>

863
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,819
<font color=#FFFF00>It's unnatural for babies of this age to be mature and well behaved.</font>

864
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:54,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't I right, my baby?</font>

865
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:55,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful.</font>

866
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:00,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on a second. Why is her diaper so wet?</font>

867
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:04,549
<font color=#FFFF00>I just changed it. Did she relieve herself again?</font>

868
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:08,049
<font color=#FFFF00>She keeps getting diaper rash.</font>

869
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:11,719
<font color=#FFFF00>How many times have I asked you to change her diapers often?</font>

870
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:13,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really going to be this careless with her?</font>

871
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:15,749
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why babysitting is so unrewarding.</font>

872
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:18,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I don't want to babysit any more. You do it yourself.</font>

873
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:19,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Come on.</font>

874
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,849
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just a little upset. Why are you getting so mad?</font>

875
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:25,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how exhausting babysitting is?</font>

876
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Even my bones and muscles ache.</font>

877
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:30,449
<font color=#FFFF00>You get paid a lot more than me.</font>

878
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:33,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you work then? I'll babysit them.</font>

879
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,149
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Swap your jobs then.</font>

880
00:46:35,149 --> 00:46:37,319
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like I'm a good cook.</font>

881
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,119
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing I can do here.</font>

882
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome! Come to me.</font>

883
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:44,779
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll change your diaper so that you can feel much better.</font>

884
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:46,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here.</font>

885
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you're just so adorable.</font>

886
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:54,149
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come here. - Let's go change your diaper.</font>

887
00:46:54,149 --> 00:46:55,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's a good boy?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Just a second.</font>

890
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:05,049
<font color=#FFFF00>I really can't go in.</font>

891
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:07,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Just trust me.</font>

892
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,219
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should go in first. - Wait...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I know that I still have a lot to learn. I have so many flaws,</font>

903
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:02,119

923
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:23,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Master, you're our shop's...</font>

924
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:27,479
<font color=#FFFF00>No, you're the pride of all tailors in Korea.</font>

925
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:29,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, stop flattering me so much.</font>

926
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:31,279
<font color=#FFFF00>You rock.</font>

927
00:49:31,879 --> 00:49:33,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you giving me some credit now?</font>

928
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:35,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what are you talking about?</font>

929
00:49:35,379 --> 00:49:38,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I succumbed a long time ago.</font>

930
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:43,219
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. When he first came to our shop,</font>

931
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:44,919
<font color=#FFFF00>he was like an angry bull.</font>

932
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:47,749
<font color=#FFFF00>He used to lash out at you all the time, you know.</font>

00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,619
<font color=#FFFF00>But he's as gentle as a lamb these days.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- When did I lash out at anyone? - Goodness.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>As of tomorrow, you will...</font>

937
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:01,119
<font color=#FFFF00>officially be working as a garment cutter at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

938
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:04,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously?</font>

939
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I already hired two people who can take care of sewing in your place.</font>

940
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:11,649
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, that's amazing. Congratulations, Yun Shil.</font>

941
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:14,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I really work as a garment cutter, Master?</font>

942
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:17,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. You've learned everything from me.</font>

943
00:50:17,149 --> 00:50:19,219
<font color=#FFFF00>And you're also studying very hard these days.</font>

944
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:22,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. I'll do my very best.</font>

945
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:24,819
<font color=#FFFF00>What about me?</font>

946
00:50:25,049 --> 00:50:27,479
<font color=#FFFF00>If Yun Shil will take care of garment cutting from now on,</font>

947
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:30,149
<font color=#FFFF00>does that mean I'll be put in charge of sewing?</font>

948
00:50:30,149 --> 00:50:33,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Hasn't Dong Jin called you?</font>

949
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:34,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

950
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,019
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll be transferred to the head office.</font>

951
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:39,319

952
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:40,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you serious?</font>

953
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:43,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

963
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:09,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I know how hard you've worked to learn everything at the shop.</font>

964
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:10,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for being patient.</font>

965
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:12,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Dong Jin.</font>

966
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:16,649
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise I'll be loyal to you until the day I die.</font>

967
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:19,179
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I don't need such a promise.</font>

968
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:20,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Just do a good job, okay?</font>

969
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,919
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm going to be your guy.</font>

970
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:26,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me know if any directors or executives get on your nerves.</font>

971
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,419
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take care of them for you.</font>

972
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:30,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Hyo Sang.</font>

973
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Mind your own business.</font>

974
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:37,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. I look forward to working with you.</font>

975
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:38,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks again.</font>

976
00:51:57,479 --> 00:51:58,519
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

977
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,019
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a gift for your mum.</font>

978
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:04,219
<font color=#FFFF00>It's your cousin's wedding, so your entire family will be there.</font>

979
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:08,249
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so bad that I can't make it as her only daughter-in-law.</font>

980
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:11,249
<font color=#FFFF00>You're busy with work, so you have no choice.</font>

981
00:52:11,479 --> 00:52:14,219
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she understands. Don't worry about it.</font>

982
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:17,379
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give her a call tomorrow.</font>

983
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't sleep here alone. You should go over to your mum's place.</font>

984
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:25,579
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go to work early tomorrow. I'll just sleep here.</font>

985
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you be okay by yourself?</font>

986
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:30,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be lonely without you,</font>

987
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:34,279
<font color=#FFFF00>but maybe it's because I think of this place as home now.</font>

988
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:36,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a lot more comfortable here than at my family home.</font>

989
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Then make sure you lock the door before you go to bed, okay?</font>

990
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:45,119
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the first time we'll be apart since getting married.</font>

991
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:47,549
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to let you go.</font>

992
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,149
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back right after the wedding.</font>

993
00:52:57,379 --> 00:53:00,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll probably run out of power since you'll be gone all night.</font>

994
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Charge me up before you go.</font>

995
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:07,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all charged up now?</font>

996
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:09,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

997
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:13,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you charged up too?</font>

998
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:15,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'm fully charged.</font>

999
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:23,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, honey!</font>

1000
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

1001
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:09,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Go in.</font>

1002
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:15,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Hyo Won.</font>

1003
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:33,019
<font color=#FFFF00>See you tomorrow.</font>

1004
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,379
<font color=#FFFF00>- Bye. - See you tomorrow, girls.</font>

1005
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:39,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me. Hello. You're Na Yun Shil, right?</font>

1006
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:41,679
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - I'm in Business Administration.</font>

1007
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,879
<font color=#FFFF00>My name is Choi Hyun Seok.</font>

1008
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,449
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I help you with?</font>

1009
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:48,149
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm actually in your fashion marketing class.</font>

1010
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:50,749
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been watching you because I'm smitten with you.</font>

1011
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:53,249
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't mind, would you like to talk over some tea?</font>

1012
00:54:53,949 --> 00:54:56,379
<font color=#FFFF00>As a matter of fact...</font>

1013
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:58,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

1014
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:05,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Our baby's hungry. We should hurry and go feed him.</font>

1015
00:55:05,879 --> 00:55:07,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Yun Shil. You're married?</font>

1016
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:10,679
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Our baby...</font>

1017
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,479
<font color=#FFFF00>was whining so much because he missed his mother.</font>

1018
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,779
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't help but come all the way here to pick her up.</font>

1019
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:17,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- I see. - I'm sorry, but I'll have go.</font>

1020
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:18,649
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go quickly. - All right.</font>

1021
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:20,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to say goodbye to him? Say goodbye.</font>

1022
00:55:20,649 --> 00:55:22,019
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go. - Shall we?</font>

1023
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:32,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed Bun. We're home now.</font>

1024
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,119
<font color=#FFFF00>You're at home now.</font>

1025
00:55:34,479 --> 00:55:35,519
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

1026
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:37,049
<font color=#FFFF00>who was that guy earlier?</font>

1027
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:38,619
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea.</font>

1028
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:40,679
<font color=#FFFF00>He says we're in the same class,</font>

1029
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,279
<font color=#FFFF00>but it was my first time seeing him today.</font>

1030
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:45,549
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not acting like you're single, are you?</font>

1031
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:46,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not.</font>

1032
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:50,219
<font color=#FFFF00>The students in my class know that I have a child.</font>

1033
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:52,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Jin. Are you jealous?</font>

1034
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I be jealous?</font>

1035
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:55,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't get jealous of anything.</font>

1036
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:59,049
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why did you act like that earlier?</font>

1037
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:00,649
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

1038
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:04,749
<font color=#FFFF00>You called me Steamed Bun's Mum out loud, didn't you?</font>

1039
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:07,219
<font color=#FFFF00>There were so many people around. It was embarrassing.</font>

1040
00:56:07,379 --> 00:56:09,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what would I call you other than Steamed Bun's Mum?</font>

1041
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:10,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is that embarrassing?</font>

1042
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:11,819
<font color=#FFFF00>You're silly.</font>

1043
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:15,149
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You're right. I was jealous.</font>

1044
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:18,119
<font color=#FFFF00>So make sure to make it clear that you're married...</font>

1045
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:19,679
<font color=#FFFF00>- and have a child from now on. - Gosh.</font>

1046
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:21,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed Bun.</font>

1047
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:24,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad's acting too jealous, isn't he?</font>

1048
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:28,349
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't you think so? - Steamed Bun. When you grow up,</font>

1049
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:31,649
<font color=#FFFF00>make sure not to meet a girl that's too beautiful and has a baby face.</font>

1050
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:34,579
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't seem to leave her alone without having to worry.</font>

1051
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,879
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so silly.</font>

1052
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:38,379
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to change his diapers.</font>

1053
00:56:38,379 --> 00:56:39,449
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Here you go.</font>

1054
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:42,449
<font color=#FFFF00>- I got him. - Lay him down.</font>

1055
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:45,219
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed Bun. There you go.</font>

1056
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:49,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go. Here's your pacifier.</font>

1057
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:51,949
<font color=#FFFF00>It's your pacifier.</font>

1058
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:54,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to suck on it?</font>

1059
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:56,079
<font color=#FFFF00>There you go.</font>

1060
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:58,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's change your diapers now.</font>

1061
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's take a look.</font>

1062
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:06,319
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. You little rascal.</font>

1063
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, Steamed Bun.</font>

1064
00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:11,219
<font color=#FFFF00>That sure was powerful.</font>

1065
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:14,179
<font color=#FFFF00>You're husband has urine all over him.</font>

1066
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:15,379
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you be laughing?</font>

1067
00:57:15,379 --> 00:57:18,179
<font color=#FFFF00>You were laughing yourself.</font>

1068
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:20,449
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a first.</font>

1069
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:22,519
<font color=#FFFF00>I never thought something like this would happen.</font>

1070
00:57:23,319 --> 00:57:25,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Steamed Bun. It's all right.</font>

1071
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,149
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll get you in some clean diapers.</font>

1072
00:57:27,149 --> 00:57:29,219
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right.</font>

1073
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,249
<font color=#FFFF00>You're all done.</font>

1074
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:17,419
<font color=#FFFF00>I was grateful that I could see even if it were something tiny.</font>

1075
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,579
<font color=#FFFF00>But I guess now...</font>

1076
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:23,879
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to see anything.</font>

1077
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:31,619
<font color=#FFFF00>The wedding was held in Gangneung,</font>

1078
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:34,149
<font color=#FFFF00>so I thought I might as well pay a visit to Mr Lee.</font>

1079
00:58:34,419 --> 00:58:37,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I see. Please say hello to him for me.</font>

1080
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:40,379
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. I'll see you later.</font>

1081
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:56,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mr Lee.</font>

1082
00:58:57,279 --> 00:58:58,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

1083
00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:04,279
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Tae Yang, Mr Lee.</font>

1084
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:06,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Tae Yang.</font>

1085
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:08,949
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

1086
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:11,349
<font color=#FFFF00>I attended my cousin's wedding in Gangneung.</font>

1087
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I'd come pay a visit while I'm here.</font>

1088
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you...</font>

1089
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:16,619
<font color=#FFFF00>for coming all this way to see me.</font>

1090
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:23,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you...</font>

1091
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,019
<font color=#FFFF00>not see me at all, Mr Lee?</font>

1092
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,119
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're such a good boy. - Overcome.</font>

1093
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:48,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome.</font>

1094
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,479
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so left out.</font>

1095
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:56,849
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. You should...</font>

1096
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:59,919
<font color=#FFFF00>go to the park to get some exercise done...</font>

1097
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:01,649
<font color=#FFFF00>and try getting a baby as well.</font>

1098
01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:02,819
<font color=#FFFF00>You can overcome this as well.</font>

1099
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:05,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Overcome.</font>

1100
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a warm cup of quince tea, everyone.</font>

1101
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:11,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

1102
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:14,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you doing well in the evening classes, Yun Shil?</font>

1103
01:00:14,419 --> 01:00:16,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Not only is she doing well,</font>

1104
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:17,849
<font color=#FFFF00>she received a bursary last term.</font>

1105
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:20,149
<font color=#FFFF00>That's impressive.</font>

1106
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't have done it without Dong Jin's help.</font>

1107
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:24,649
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys are unbelievable love birds.</font>

1108
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:26,649
<font color=#FFFF00>When will they ever stop?</font>

1109
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,579
<font color=#FFFF00>- Overcome. - Yes, Tae Yang.</font>

1110
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:33,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be too shocked, Dong Jin.</font>

1111
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:35,079
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? Has something happened?</font>

1112
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:36,849
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm in Gangneung right now.</font>

1113
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:40,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Lee...</font>

1114
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,919
<font color=#FFFF00>has completely lost his eyesight.</font>

1115
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:44,819
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1116
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:30,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Mum?</font>

1117
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,279
<font color=#FFFF00>It must've been a shock to her.</font>

1118
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,379
<font color=#FFFF00>She's lying down in the room. She's not feeling well.</font>

1119
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:38,019
<font color=#FFFF00>You really...</font>

1120
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:40,279
<font color=#FFFF00>can't see anything?</font>

1121
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:42,449
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

1122
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:47,219
<font color=#FFFF00>It just happened.</font>

1123
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

1124
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,319
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to cry.</font>

1125
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,649
<font color=#FFFF00>This was expected.</font>

1126
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:12,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

1127
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:13,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Lee.</font>

1128
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:14,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

1129
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,449
<font color=#FFFF00>For my sake,</font>

1130
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:22,219
<font color=#FFFF00>please accept this in a calm manner.</font>

1131
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:28,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Come back with us to Seoul.</font>

1132
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:30,349
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't...</font>

1133
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,219
<font color=#FFFF00>leave you here any longer.</font>

1134
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,379
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1135
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:35,549
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be stubborn.</font>

1136
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,349
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to become an ill-tempered old man...</font>

1137
01:02:38,779 --> 01:02:41,219
<font color=#FFFF00>who lives his life making his children worry...</font>

1138
01:02:41,649 --> 01:02:43,649
<font color=#FFFF00>when you should all be busy with your own lives.</font>

1139
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:47,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home.</font>

1140
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:54,219
<font color=#FFFF00>As soon as Mother is feeling better,</font>

1141
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:55,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pack their important belongings and take them home.</font>

1142
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:58,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Sook said she'd take care of Steamed Bun for us.</font>

1143
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:00,719
<font color=#FFFF00>- All right. - Drive safely.</font>

1144
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:01,849
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

1145
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:07,419
<font color=#FFFF00>You mustn't panic...</font>

1146
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,919
<font color=#FFFF00>in order for Father to remain calm.</font>

1147
01:03:11,779 --> 01:03:12,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't.</font>

1148
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,149
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

1149
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:29,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Pull over for a minute, will you?</font>

1150
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:35,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to take home the feeling of the sea breeze...</font>

1151
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,449
<font color=#FFFF00>in my heart.</font>

1152
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:05,649
<font color=#FFFF00>The wind's quite chilly, Mr Lee.</font>

1153
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:07,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you be all right?</font>

1154
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:09,119
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm all right. I like the cool breeze.</font>

1155
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:12,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it frustrating now that you can't see the view of the ocean?</font>

1156
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:13,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

1157
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:16,019
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I'd feel...</font>

1158
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,249
<font color=#FFFF00>uncomfortable once I lose my eyesight.</font>

1159
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:19,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Surprisingly,</font>

1160
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,419
<font color=#FFFF00>it feels like I can see a whole different view now.</font>

1161
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:24,749
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it you see, Mr Lee?</font>

1162
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:27,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I can see my life.</font>

1163
01:04:31,779 --> 01:04:35,219
<font color=#FFFF00>When I had good eyesight, I only saw what was in front of me.</font>

1164
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:38,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that I can't see and forget what's surrounding me,</font>

1165
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,019
<font color=#FFFF00>the images of my past...</font>

1166
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,479
<font color=#FFFF00>seem to unfold in my head like a beautiful painting.</font>

1167
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:48,879
<font color=#FFFF00>So there's no need for me to feel frustrated.</font>

1168
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:54,919
<font color=#FFFF00>What was your life like, Dad?</font>

1169
01:04:56,819 --> 01:04:58,849
<font color=#FFFF00>It was dazzlingly beautiful.</font>

1170
01:05:00,219 --> 01:05:02,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Luxurious beyond measure for me.</font>

1171
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,679
<font color=#FFFF00>The trade I'd learned as a child...</font>

1172
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:09,549
<font color=#FFFF00>was to see and make grand suits.</font>

1173
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:11,749
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't love my job more.</font>

1174
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:15,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Now those times stretch before me...</font>

1175
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:20,049
<font color=#FFFF00>like a roll of beautiful fabric.</font>

1176
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:28,549
<font color=#FFFF00>The verb we use to say we make clothes means "to form".</font>
