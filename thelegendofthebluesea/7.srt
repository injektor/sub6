00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,289
<font color="yellow">Episode 7</font>

3
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,390
<font color="yellow">His pulse is weak.</font>

4
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,660
<font color="yellow">His tendons, bones, and flesh are damaged and have formed blood clots.</font>

5
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,890
<font color="yellow">If it gets into his heart-</font>

6
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,270
<font color="yellow">If that's the case, what happens?</font>

7
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,140
<font color="yellow">He won't be able to overcome the coming crisis.</font>

8
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,469
<font color="yellow">I believe he was beat up by a group of people after he fell off from the cliff.</font>

9
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:40,380
<font color="yellow">It seems like my friend secretly hid my lover,</font>

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,290
<font color="yellow">and fell upon this calamity while coming back down.</font>

11
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,430
<font color="yellow">My Lord, about my concubine making a ruckus in your office the day before yesterday...</font>

12
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,340
<font color="yellow">please forgive her.</font>

13
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,460
<font color="yellow">She was afraid that the evil omen that brings death might have entered the government office.</font>

14
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,030
<font color="yellow">It seems like she was out of her mind in worry of that.</font>

15
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,250
<font color="yellow">So, I reprimanded her to the point of tears.</font>

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,189
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

17
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,210
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

18
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,120
<font color="yellow">A few days ago, ever since that corpse was found at the beach,</font>

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,020
<font color="yellow">the sentiment of the village people has become panic-stricken.</font>

20
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,569
<font color="yellow">So you must have also been disheartened. I am very sorry, Sir.</font>

21
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,240
<font color="yellow">I see that you have some rare and precious fruit.</font>

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,060
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. It is tangerine.</font>

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,610
<font color="yellow">Although I am of a lowly position, I have a taste for good food.</font>

24
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,530
<font color="yellow">So I got it through a boat coming from Tamra Island (today's Jeju Island) after much difficulty.</font>

25
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:55,849
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

26
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,250
<font color="yellow">This inn is probably the only place to be able to eat this kind of fruit in this village, right?</font>

27
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,370
<font color="yellow">Of course. The price is... exorbitant.</font>

28
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,629
<font color="yellow">But this tangerine was found while examining</font>

29
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:12,170
<font color="yellow">the corpse found at the beach.</font>

30
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,319
<font color="yellow">On the day that he died, the last person he met was you.</font>

31
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:29,140
<font color="yellow">You met him that night and offered him a drink, along with this fruit.</font>

32
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,560
<font color="yellow">He died from drinking the alcohol spiked with poison, and you threw him on the beach.</font>

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,490
<font color="yellow">However, the traces of poison was not found during the initial examination.</font>

34
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,849
<font color="yellow">On the first day that snow fell and water froze, the corpse was frozen like ice, but then</font>

35
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,180
<font color="yellow">it was different during the secondary examination of the corpse.</font>

36
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,430
<font color="yellow">As the frozen corpse melted, deathly poison extracted from the blow fish eggs was found.</font>

37
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,870
<font color="yellow">My Lord, I am ignorant and cannot understand what you-</font>

38
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,270
<font color="yellow">- Look here!<br>- Yes, Sir!</font>

39
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:15,150
<font color="yellow">We have found the blowfish egg's poison in Yang Seung Gil's room.</font>

40
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,219
<font color="yellow">My Lord, it's unfair.</font>

41
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:24,029
<font color="yellow">Your servant does not know anything. I've been set-up.</font>

42
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:26,139
<font color="yellow">My Lord!</font>

43
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,149
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

44
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,429
<font color="yellow">Won't you let go!</font>

45
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,289
<font color="yellow">Come!</font>

46
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:41,879
<font color="yellow">What do you think you are doing?!</font>

47
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,349
<font color="yellow">Please, comply with us.</font>

48
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,319
<font color="yellow">If Se Hwa is alive then I will save your life.</font>

49
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,019
<font color="yellow">Who is that? I don't know.</font>

50
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:05,000
<font color="yellow">If you don't know then you will die.</font>

51
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,149
<font color="yellow">Even if I can't find Se Hwa</font>

52
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:14,079
<font color="yellow">you will die in this place.</font>

53
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:07,529
<font color="yellow">Look here! The town head is bewitched by that wily thing and trying to destroy the village.</font>

54
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:13,750
<font color="yellow">He is trying to save that mermaid who brought rainstorms and caused people to die!</font>

55
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:19,079
<font color="yellow">Try stepping out just one step.</font>

56
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,199
<font color="yellow">Do you think all these eyes and mouths will stay still?</font>

57
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,889
<font color="yellow">Oh, no, you can't!</font>

58
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,639
<font color="yellow">My pearls!</font>

59
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,299
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I came too late.</font>

60
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:43,739
<font color="yellow">â¬  Stained with ink â¬</font>

61
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:49,679
<font color="yellow">Se Hwa, you liked listening to my dreams, didn't you?</font>

62
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,349
<font color="yellow">Are you listening?</font>

63
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,009
<font color="yellow">In my dream, we were born again.</font>

64
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:06,069
<font color="yellow">We met again and were together.</font>

65
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,989
<font color="yellow">You came from a far away ocean to meet me.</font>

66
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,750
<font color="yellow">â¬  The person you've been longing for â¬</font>

67
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,919
<font color="yellow">And though I could not remember you,</font>

68
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,379
<font color="yellow">you were already in my heart.</font>

69
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,989
<font color="yellow">â¬  She became a mermaid â¬</font>

70
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:33,190
<font color="yellow">Se Hwa.</font>

71
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:39,169
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you like to listen to more of this story?</font>

72
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,600
<font color="yellow">â¬ A sad story â¬</font>

73
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,149
<font color="yellow">Legend of the Blue Sea</font>

74
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,649
<font color="yellow">I need to confirm something.</font>

75
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,299
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

76
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:06,649
<font color="yellow">You... can you try saying these words?</font>

77
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,730
<font color="yellow">What words?</font>

78
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,579
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

79
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,629
<font color="yellow">Then are you mine?</font>

80
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,139
<font color="yellow">Are you surrendering? Did you lose?</font>

81
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:45,579
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

82
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,509
<font color="yellow">I was going to be the first to surrender when the first snow falls.</font>

83
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:54,340
<font color="yellow">I really did not know you would surrender first. Are you mine?</font>

84
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,319
<font color="yellow">No matter what I say, would you believe me?</font>

85
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,500
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

86
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,919
<font color="yellow">You said you love me. That's what it means, right?</font>

87
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,649
<font color="yellow">Let's say you love someone.</font>

88
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,100
<font color="yellow">That means that you surrender.</font>

89
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,009
<font color="yellow">What's "surrender"?</font>

90
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,159
<font color="yellow">It means, losing. You lost. In other words, if you love someone,</font>

91
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,459
<font color="yellow">no matter what that person says, you will believe everything.</font>

92
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,419
<font color="yellow">- That means you are in trouble.<br>- Why?</font>

93
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:26,110
<font color="yellow">That means that you belong to that guy. If he says to do this, you do this.</font>

94
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,289
<font color="yellow">If he says to do that, you will do that. If he tells you to believe lies, then you believe lies. That's love.</font>

95
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:33,659
<font color="yellow">So is it okay to say that to a guy or not?</font>

96
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:34,740
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

97
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,079
<font color="yellow">No! You shouldn't.</font>

98
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,799
<font color="yellow">If you say things like "I love you" to me, that means you are mine.</font>

99
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,279
<font color="yellow">If you say things like that to me, I'll probably use you to do things and lie like crazy.</font>

100
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,139
<font color="yellow">I'll take all your possessions.</font>

101
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:50,949
<font color="yellow">That is supposed to be love.</font>

102
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,980
<font color="yellow">Ah, geez! Who would utter such nonsense?!</font>

103
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,970
<font color="yellow">â¬  Even at this moment. â¬</font>

104
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,019
<font color="yellow">There's someone. Someone good.</font>

105
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,159
<font color="yellow">Who is it? A guy?</font>

106
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,350
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a guy.</font>

107
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,439
<font color="yellow">So, it's a guy. He is a nut job!</font>

108
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,689
<font color="yellow">What's a nut job?</font>

109
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,850
<font color="yellow">He is a crazy jerk.</font>

110
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,909
<font color="yellow">Seeing how he says things like that, he is a total sleazeball and a womanizer.</font>

111
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:26,809
<font color="yellow">Those are all bad words, right?</font>

112
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,149
<font color="yellow">Right. You should not hang out with that kind of punk.</font>

113
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,829
<font color="yellow">Was he really good to you? Huh?</font>

114
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,459
<font color="yellow">When it was raining, he put an umbrella over me, and he held my hand when I was alone.</font>

115
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,929
<font color="yellow">Ah, hand...</font>

116
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:44,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he will do anything... to seduce a girl.</font>

117
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,850
<font color="yellow">He made me ramen.</font>

118
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,299
<font color="yellow">Ra...ramen! Wow, ramen!</font>

119
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,899
<font color="yellow">Did he tell you to come in and eat some ramen before leaving?<br>(It's a common pick up line in Korea)</font>

120
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,629
<font color="yellow">Wow, what a dark-hearted jerk!</font>

121
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,220
<font color="yellow">He is not a dark-hearted jerk.</font>

122
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,220
<font color="yellow">He is a good person.</font>

123
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,549
<font color="yellow">If he was such a good person, you should be next to him, not by me.</font>

124
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:14,620
<font color="yellow">And let me make it clear, in case you misunderstand... When I said earlier...</font>

125
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,519
<font color="yellow">"I love you," was not because I really loved you,</font>

126
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,949
<font color="yellow">but I was telling you to say that, so that I can confirm something-</font>

127
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,279
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

128
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,539
<font color="yellow">- Should I say it again?<br>- No, that's fine.</font>

129
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,269
<font color="yellow">I can say it again.</font>

130
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,449
<font color="yellow">No, don't. It's fine.</font>

131
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,120
<font color="yellow">Don't say it.</font>

132
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,419
<font color="yellow">- Where are you coming from?<br>- From a ski resort.</font>

133
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,819
<font color="yellow">Did you have a date?</font>

134
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,549
<font color="yellow">Date, my butt!</font>

135
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:05,279
<font color="yellow">She was begging about snow, so I just took her there briefly.</font>

136
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,949
<font color="yellow">That's a date. Isn't that right, Tae Oh?</font>

137
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,329
<font color="yellow">This dude keeps glaring at a person all the time nowadays.</font>

138
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,549
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some?<br>- No, thanks. You can eat all the tangerines you like.</font>

139
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,620
<font color="yellow">Do you want some?</font>

140
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,669
<font color="yellow">Did you have a fight with him?</font>

141
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,110
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't.</font>

142
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,539
<font color="yellow">Then why is he in such a bad mood?</font>

143
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,110
<font color="yellow">Yo, upper room!</font>

144
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,049
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

145
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,840
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

146
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,789
<font color="yellow">Since I can't fall asleep, I keep thinking these useless thoughts. Are you still meeting him?</font>

147
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:25,649
<font color="yellow">- Who?<br>- Who else?! Earlier...</font>

148
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,610
<font color="yellow">Ramen! Are you still seeing him?</font>

149
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

150
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,230
<font color="yellow">You are?</font>

151
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,679
<font color="yellow">I see. You are seeing him.</font>

152
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,949
<font color="yellow">Well, how does he look?</font>

153
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:59,179
<font color="yellow">He is pretty.</font>

154
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:03,509
<font color="yellow">His eyes are twinkling.</font>

155
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,340
<font color="yellow">He must look like a girly boy.</font>

156
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,019
<font color="yellow">You should be most careful with guys who look like that! What good is a guy who looks pretty?</font>

157
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:15,009
<font color="yellow">Those guys are lustful inside!</font>

158
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,860
<font color="yellow">You... so did you tell him that, too?</font>

159
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,819
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

160
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:28,649
<font color="yellow">You know... Those words you said earlier at the ski resort.</font>

161
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,610
<font color="yellow">I love you?</font>

162
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,909
<font color="yellow">Yes. That. Did you tell that jerk that, too?</font>

163
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,559
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

164
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,459
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

165
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,149
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

166
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,399
<font color="yellow">To you, those words must be so easy.</font>

167
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,829
<font color="yellow">- Saying those words to just anyone.<br>- I don't say it just to anyone.</font>

168
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:03,870
<font color="yellow">What did you do well that you are raising your voice?</font>

169
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,220
<font color="yellow">You get up! Who told you to come done, eh?</font>

170
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,169
<font color="yellow">Go back up.</font>

171
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,159
<font color="yellow">But, well, maybe it's a good thing.</font>

172
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:25,220
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I felt a bit burdened, worrying that you had a special feeling towards me.</font>

173
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,090
<font color="yellow">Good luck with him.</font>

174
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,990
<font color="yellow">I will. I came to work things out with him.</font>

175
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,829
<font color="yellow">Good, then!</font>

176
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:39,319
<font color="yellow">Must be nice! Good luck! Hurry and get back up!</font>

177
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,559
<font color="yellow">She came to work things out with him? Then, why is she here?</font>

178
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,659
<font color="yellow">Haha, isn't she a funny girl?! Ah, annoying.</font>

179
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,980
<font color="yellow">So annoying.</font>

180
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,769
<font color="yellow">Se Hwa!</font>

181
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:30,840
<font color="yellow">Se Hwa! Se Hwa!</font>

182
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,440
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

183
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,180
<font color="yellow">What kind of dream was that?</font>

184
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,550
<font color="yellow">This ajussi is our Joon Jae's friend.</font>

185
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,350
<font color="yellow">Dept. Head Nam Ajussi</font>

186
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,140
<font color="yellow">010-0960-1303</font>

187
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,480
<font color="yellow">He cannot answer the phone. You will be connected to the voice mail.</font>

188
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

189
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, what's up?</font>

190
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,790
<font color="yellow">Dept. Head Nam? He hasn't come to work yet.</font>

191
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,830
<font color="yellow">What? How?</font>

192
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,769
<font color="yellow">Is he that kind of person? So where is he now?</font>

193
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:20,390
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's hang up for now.</font>

194
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,930
<font color="yellow">What happened, Father?</font>

195
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,850
<font color="yellow">Dept. Head Nam drove while drunk last night and got into an accident.</font>

196
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,370
<font color="yellow">Ajussi doesn't like drinking though.</font>

197
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,070
<font color="yellow">How would you know? How can you tell a person by looking at his appearance?</font>

198
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,170
<font color="yellow">So, how much is he hurt?</font>

199
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,190
<font color="yellow">Should we go visit him at the hospital?</font>

200
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,850
<font color="yellow">He is unconscious. It seems serious.</font>

201
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,250
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

202
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,400
<font color="yellow">Oh no. What do we do?</font>

203
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,000
<font color="yellow">When you go to the hospital, let me go with you.</font>

204
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,600
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's do that.</font>

205
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,470
<font color="yellow">2) 8/21/2016 Incheon International Airport<br>Disguised as a valet parking staff, he stole a luxury car and ran away</font>

206
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,000
<font color="yellow">It's been three months. During the three months, that punk Ma Dae Young...</font>

207
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,240
<font color="yellow">without having confirmed any additional criminal activities, his whereabouts are still in the dark.</font>

208
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,050
<font color="yellow">You said that there is a possibility for the Haewondong loanshark murder case could be him.</font>

209
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,710
<font color="yellow">There is.</font>

210
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,759
<font color="yellow">No, it is highly possible. But we only have a suspicion. We don't have evidence.</font>

211
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,630
<font color="yellow">There was no money or belongings that were lost. So, in that precinct,</font>

212
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,120
<font color="yellow">they see these debtors that disappeared overseas as suspects, and they told me not me to butt in.</font>

213
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,950
<font color="yellow">He was a loan shark and a person who had a lot of people holding a grudge against him, so that's possible.</font>

214
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,019
<font color="yellow">If it was due to a grudge, they would have planned it well. But look at the time and location.</font>

215
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,420
<font color="yellow">It was in broad daylight at three in the afternoon.</font>

216
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,930
<font color="yellow">Anyone would be able to witness this while passing by.</font>

217
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,110
<font color="yellow">But then, this was done very momentarily and impulsive.</font>

218
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,690
<font color="yellow">- Ma Dae Young has an anger disorder.<br>- With just that...</font>

219
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,220
<font color="yellow">Nowadays, there aren't just one or two people who can't control their anger.</font>

220
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,920
<font color="yellow">It was really meticulous. It's really clean without any fingerprints or traces of DNA.</font>

221
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,769
<font color="yellow">This is done by someone who is always prepared to murder.</font>

222
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,009
<font color="yellow">But it seems our superiors don't want us to focus on that.</font>

223
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,769
<font color="yellow">If an escaped criminal committed that kind of crime? Then we will be more cursed at.</font>

224
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,009
<font color="yellow">Hey! Do you think that's important?</font>

225
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,050
<font color="yellow">Then what is so important to you?</font>

226
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,720
<font color="yellow">You, punk, go catch that dude who feigned false identity in Yeoyido.</font>

227
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,230
<font color="yellow">The one who erased all the CCTVs and took off.</font>

228
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,290
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling I know who that is. I will catch that slimeball after catching Ma Dae Young.</font>

229
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,240
<font color="yellow">You are so dead, you punk!</font>

230
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,410
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Hey!</font>

231
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,400
<font color="yellow">The female employees at the aquarium thought Yeongdeung Police has such a handsome detective</font>

232
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,269
<font color="yellow">and they were about to start a fan club, then they saw your profile and they were so disappointed!</font>

233
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,330
<font color="yellow">Why are they disappointed? He and I look pretty much similar!</font>

234
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,980
<font color="yellow">According to Ahn Jin Joo's SNS, she will be attending a seminar for International Middle School Preparation.</font>

235
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,540
<font color="yellow">Communicating to SNS followers. VIP invitation</font>

236
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,670
<font color="yellow">to International Middle School - Zeal for Education. This is Helicopter Mom's way.</font>

237
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:03,340
<font color="yellow">She's leaving at three. She's probably going out of the house at 2-2:30.</font>

238
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,110
<font color="yellow">The family's chauffeur is on a day off. Ahn Jin Joo's driving skill is a bit lacking.</font>

239
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,460
<font color="yellow">At that moment, Tae Oh will call using the English Academy's number and distract her.</font>

240
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am Elizabeth's mom. Really?</font>

241
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,310
<font color="yellow">Our Elizabeth, oh my! Was first in English oral competition? Oh my God!</font>

242
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,120
<font color="yellow">Are you not hurt anywhere?</font>

243
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,100
<font color="yellow">I don't think so. Yes. Omo.</font>

244
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,140
<font color="yellow">Please just call this number. Since I am busy, I will be going then.</font>

245
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,990
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

246
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,400
<font color="yellow">After you make your face seen, your second meeting would be at the seminar.</font>

247
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,050
<font color="yellow">- Okay.<br>- What are you doing?</font>

248
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,680
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

249
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,150
<font color="yellow">Let's go.<br>- Where are you going?</font>

250
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,150
<font color="yellow">Where would we be going? To work.</font>

251
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,290
<font color="yellow">We're going to work.</font>

252
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,290
<font color="yellow">Going to work. What work are you going to do?</font>

253
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,990
<font color="yellow">Ah... that is... the work that we are doing is...</font>

254
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,420
<font color="yellow">To say it simply, it's like getting a person's heart?</font>

255
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,820
<font color="yellow">To let a person realize his or her own fault.</font>

256
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,250
<font color="yellow">Although there definitely is a problem with the way they accumulated their wealth, and yet they are beyond the perimeters of the law.</font>

257
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,390
<font color="yellow">To those people who fall into that blind spot,</font>

258
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,440
<font color="yellow">we take appropriate actions.</font>

259
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,790
<font color="yellow">We also redistribute the wealth.</font>

260
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,310
<font color="yellow">For the country's sake.</font>

261
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,180
<font color="yellow">A public office worker?</font>

262
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,830
<font color="yellow">I saw it on TV, the ones who work for the country are public office workers.</font>

263
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,430
<font color="yellow">We are not. Just because they work at public office doesn't mean they are doing it for the country's benefit.</font>

264
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,509
<font color="yellow">So, Heo Joon Jae does a cooler job than a public office worker.</font>

265
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,750
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

266
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,370
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, I knew it.</font>

267
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,920
<font color="yellow">Why am I making excuses to her?</font>

268
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,930
<font color="yellow">I know, right? You were really shabby, listening right here.</font>

269
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,550
<font color="yellow">Then, should I say it? That we're conmen?</font>

270
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,950
<font color="yellow">I don't feel good about that word.</font>

271
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,340
<font color="yellow">Hey, should we make a new name? A cool one?</font>

272
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,230
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying?<br>- Okay, okay. We're late. Let's go.</font>

273
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,900
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

274
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,410
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

275
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,410
<font color="yellow">Check this house.</font>

276
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,380
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey.</font>

277
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,170
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young! You bastard!</font>

278
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,060
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young, bastard!</font>

279
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,500
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young!</font>

280
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

281
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,420
<font color="yellow">Wow! Score!</font>

282
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,440
<font color="yellow">So cold.</font>

283
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,780
<font color="yellow">I am hungry, should we go to the convenience store to eat?</font>

284
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

285
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:35,240
<font color="yellow">Hey! Seo Yoon Ah, you live in rental Apartments, right?</font>

286
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,019
<font color="yellow">- So?<br>- My mom said</font>

287
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:43,280
<font color="yellow">as the rental kids started coming to our school, our neighborhood's quality went down!</font>

288
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,330
<font color="yellow">Your mom is a divorcee, right?</font>

289
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,180
<font color="yellow">My mom said so.</font>

290
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,990
<font color="yellow">Kids like you have such a messy family education.</font>

291
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,330
<font color="yellow">So, she told me not to play with you.</font>

292
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,420
<font color="yellow">I also don't want to play with you. Can you please move?</font>

293
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,140
<font color="yellow">This is not a place for people who live in the renal apartment to pass, you know.</font>

294
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,360
<font color="yellow">Can you turn around and pass there?</font>

295
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,170
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

296
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,440
<font color="yellow">Hey! You pushed me! You? To me?</font>

297
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:42,350
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Put me down please.</font>

298
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,060
<font color="yellow">You should not bother your friends.</font>

299
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,420
<font color="yellow">Let me down please.</font>

300
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,670
<font color="yellow">Hurry and promise me, that you won't bother your friend.</font>

301
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,570
<font color="yellow">- Mommy.</font>

302
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,710
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth. What's wrong?</font>

303
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:16,910
<font color="yellow">Hurry and come.</font>

304
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,200
<font color="yellow">Yes. The car is still here.</font>

305
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,360
<font color="yellow">Thank you for earlier, Unnie.</font>

306
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,590
<font color="yellow">But what is divorce?</font>

307
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,910
<font color="yellow">Divorce is when people who got married break up.</font>

308
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,210
<font color="yellow">Why would they break up?</font>

309
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,640
<font color="yellow">You also don't know that, Unnie? They break up because they don't love each other anymore.</font>

310
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,490
<font color="yellow">They don't love each other so why did they get married?</font>

311
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,980
<font color="yellow">They are in love when they got married but they change that's why.</font>

312
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,370
<font color="yellow">My mom and dad probably loved each other when I was a baby.</font>

313
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,310
<font color="yellow">It's just that they changed.</font>

314
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,450
<font color="yellow">Why would they change?</font>

315
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,300
<font color="yellow">Where would you find "why?"</font>

316
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,110
<font color="yellow">It's just that they all change.</font>

317
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:14,670
<font color="yellow">Even those who are not divorced are staying together not necessarily because they love each other.</font>

318
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,030
<font color="yellow">They are living while enduring it.</font>

319
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,850
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

320
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:24,790
<font color="yellow">Unnie, do you know why I'm working hard going to the academy?</font>

321
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,030
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

322
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,570
<font color="yellow">My mom... might love me now</font>

323
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,640
<font color="yellow">but if I don't study hard...</font>

324
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,140
<font color="yellow">she might not love me anymore.</font>

325
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,380
<font color="yellow">She might send me away.</font>

326
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,250
<font color="yellow">That's why, even if I don't want to go to the academy I work hard and go.</font>

327
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,950
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

328
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:10,870
<font color="yellow">That hair, it may appear messy as if it wasn't prepped.</font>

329
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,519
<font color="yellow">It's so calculatedly elegant. Where is it?</font>

330
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,110
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

331
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,150
<font color="yellow">Which shop did she have it done?</font>

332
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,860
<font color="yellow">Mom! I told you it's that Unnie.</font>

333
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,590
<font color="yellow">Is it you?</font>

334
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,680
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who told my daughter off?</font>

335
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,460
<font color="yellow">How could it be? The outfit does not match at all.</font>

336
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,240
<font color="yellow">It may look like the soup and rice being served separately, and yet they match so marvelously well.What is this weird feeling?</font>

337
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,360
<font color="yellow">Who coordinated that?</font>

338
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,019
<font color="yellow">It's because she bothered her.</font>

339
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:47,060
<font color="yellow">So funny. Who are you?</font>

340
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,450
<font color="yellow">Are you her mother? Are you the school teacher?</font>

341
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,850
<font color="yellow">These days, even school teachers can't just...</font>

342
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,900
<font color="yellow">When did Chanel and Dior collaborate?</font>

343
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,160
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Why didn't I know that?</font>

344
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,840
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

345
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,470
<font color="yellow">I am Seo Yoon Ah's friend.</font>

346
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,070
<font color="yellow">In the future, I won't let you go if you bother my friend.</font>

347
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,750
<font color="yellow">You promised.</font>

348
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,490
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

349
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,810
<font color="yellow">I... have a lot I am curious about, but let me just ask you one thing.</font>

350
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,880
<font color="yellow">Which dermatologist do you go to?</font>

351
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,380
<font color="yellow">"I don't go," "I was born with this skin," "I don't even take care of it and it's like this."</font>

352
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,990
<font color="yellow">Don't even think of saying those nonsense lies.</font>

353
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,410
<font color="yellow">Answer me, where do you get taken care of?</font>

354
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,180
<font color="yellow">It's not in Seoul. It's very far.</font>

355
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,680
<font color="yellow">I knew it. So, she goes out to expedition. Oh my!</font>

356
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,960
<font color="yellow">Which country...</font>

357
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,540
<font color="yellow">Oh my world. Which country could she get...</font>

358
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,230
<font color="yellow">What is it? It's past 3.</font>

359
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,190
<font color="yellow">I know. It's strange.</font>

360
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,680
<font color="yellow">The car is still there.</font>

361
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,470
<font color="yellow">She must have gone out and just came back.</font>

362
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,130
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

363
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,910
<font color="yellow">I'm going to rest today. Culture shock! When did Chanel and Dior collaborate?</font>

364
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,780
<font color="yellow">I'd appreciate information exchanged. This is FaPe's way.</font>

365
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,759
<font color="yellow">This is FaPe's way.</font>

366
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,519
<font color="yellow">Fashion people?</font>

367
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,990
<font color="yellow">Seriously. Today was such a waste.</font>

368
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,550
<font color="yellow">I'm really not feeling this. Can't you look into something else?</font>

369
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,840
<font color="yellow">You're at it again.</font>

370
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,380
<font color="yellow">Hey! I will be stopping by somewhere.</font>

371
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,920
<font color="yellow">You guys on first.</font>

372
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,490
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?<br>- You don't need to know, punk.</font>

373
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,850
<font color="yellow">You don't even have anywhere else to go...</font>

374
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,030
<font color="yellow">Could it be? It's probably not him.</font>

375
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,920
<font color="yellow">My Joon Jae.</font>

376
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,690
<font color="yellow">But why are you doing this?</font>

377
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,250
<font color="yellow">This is the only thing I am good at.</font>

378
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,990
<font color="yellow">You could just use that talent somewhere else. I am envious.</font>

379
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,950
<font color="yellow">Like you are the one to say that.</font>

380
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,460
<font color="yellow">- Then what about you?<br>- It's Hyung.</font>

381
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,019
<font color="yellow">Hyung, what happened for you to start this line of work?</font>

382
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,460
<font color="yellow">So, people</font>

383
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,990
<font color="yellow">need to meet the right people.</font>

384
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,480
<font color="yellow">Looking for mom. We got separated when I was 10.<br>Her name is Mo Yoo Ran. Her birthday is...</font>

385
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,700
<font color="yellow">We could have just done it if the office interior was done.</font>

386
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,309
<font color="yellow">Can you really find my mom?</font>

387
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:42,930
<font color="yellow">Your mother's hometown was Cheongbuk</font>

388
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,490
<font color="yellow">Jaecheon, right?<br>- Yes.</font>

389
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,380
<font color="yellow">She's the only daughter of a really rich household.</font>

390
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,220
<font color="yellow">But after her parents passed away, she made a mistake of cosigning a loan that went wrong.</font>

391
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,230
<font color="yellow">She lost all her inheritance. After that none of the relatives contacted her.</font>

392
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,079
<font color="yellow">Yes, how did you know?</font>

393
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,450
<font color="yellow">How would I? It's my work.</font>

394
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,309
<font color="yellow">Can you please find my mom?</font>

395
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:08,150
<font color="yellow">But then,</font>

396
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,920
<font color="yellow">the fact that she hasn't reported her moving,</font>

397
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,260
<font color="yellow">and that she doesn't have a permanent residency, and she doesn't seem like she's remarried.</font>

398
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,730
<font color="yellow">It is very hard to find her with the usual way.</font>

399
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,030
<font color="yellow">In the end, you would have to get an expert but then the fee would be</font>

400
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,800
<font color="yellow">Ah, the fee.</font>

401
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,750
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

402
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,550
<font color="yellow">Would this much be okay?</font>

403
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,519
<font color="yellow">Of course that man just ran off with that money.</font>

404
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,400
<font color="yellow">You should not worry about that part.</font>

405
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,660
<font color="yellow">I will find him for sure.</font>

406
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,050
<font color="yellow">I will be calling you after a week.</font>

407
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,349
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

408
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,070
<font color="yellow">You conman!</font>

409
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,360
<font color="yellow">Ahjumma, he is a conman! Don't give him money!</font>

410
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,260
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

411
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,940
<font color="yellow">- Give me back my money!<br>- Let go! Let go!<br>- My money! My money!</font>

412
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,329
<font color="yellow">How many days were you there?</font>

413
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,920
<font color="yellow">Half a month.</font>

414
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,220
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

415
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,809
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to work with me? I like people who are tenacious.</font>

416
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:53,329
<font color="yellow">If you go around finding your mother like that, only your legs would hurt.</font>

417
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,670
<font color="yellow">You need to have money to find your mom. To put it bluntly,</font>

418
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,099
<font color="yellow">you found your mom but then what would you do since you have no money?</font>

419
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,220
<font color="yellow">When would would you earn enough money ripping off a young kid like me?</font>

420
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,130
<font color="yellow">What? You should rip off of people who have a lot of money.</font>

421
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:12,460
<font color="yellow">If you are going to deceive someone anyway, you need to invest in time and finance.</font>

422
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,849
<font color="yellow">If you consider the financial efficiency,</font>

423
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,019
<font color="yellow">wouldn't it be more profitable to steal from rich people, using the same effort?</font>

424
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,019
<font color="yellow">There are so many bigwigs who can't report even when they are ripped off.</font>

425
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:32,269
<font color="yellow">Just until I find my mom. Just until I get enough money to buy a house for her.</font>

426
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,430
<font color="yellow">You already gathered enough to buy her a house.</font>

427
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,289
<font color="yellow">I did. It's just that I haven't found my mom.</font>

428
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,079
<font color="yellow">Gae Nam Doo also worked hard to find my mom.</font>

429
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,519
<font color="yellow">But he couldn't find where she is.</font>

430
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,769
<font color="yellow">Please look at this, hyung.</font>

431
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,660
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

432
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,820
<font color="yellow">If it's the same person's x-rays. The other hospital said it was switched with another patient.</font>

433
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,470
<font color="yellow">This is the same person.</font>

434
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,500
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

435
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,320
<font color="yellow">You can just look at the bones and the fracture. Look here.</font>

436
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,309
<font color="yellow">The widths of tibia and fibula and the way they are stretched out are the same.</font>

437
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:35,300
<font color="yellow">This one has a fracture and this one is in stage of healing.</font>

438
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,849
<font color="yellow">- Oh?<br>- Why?</font>

439
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:41,450
<font color="yellow">The bone has stuck together but there is still edema.</font>

440
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,730
<font color="yellow">Usually, the swelling disappears and then the bone sticks together but then for this person the bones stuck first.</font>

441
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,269
<font color="yellow">Can this happen?</font>

442
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:55,519
<font color="yellow">Hyung, what's that... How long does it usually take for the fractured bones to stick together again?</font>

443
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,789
<font color="yellow">It's case by case basis, but still</font>

444
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,660
<font color="yellow">for the fractured bone to stick together completely, about 12-16 weeks.</font>

445
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, even with a hairline fracture, it's maximum 3-4 week with a cast.</font>

446
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,970
<font color="yellow">What if in just one week this, became this?</font>

447
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,559
<font color="yellow">Does that make sense?</font>

448
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,570
<font color="yellow">Right. It doesn't make sense.</font>

449
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,349
<font color="yellow">Hurry and go. I am busy.</font>

450
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:24,470
<font color="yellow">What is that? So scary. What if she's really a zombie.</font>

451
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, as if.</font>

452
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,599
<font color="yellow">I think that woman... beyond just losing her memories</font>

453
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,820
<font color="yellow">or lacking a bit, disregarding those, there's something.</font>

454
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,690
<font color="yellow">I know. I also think so. But I can't get a grasp of what that is.</font>

455
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:47,960
<font color="yellow">Hello? Did you find ___________?</font>

456
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,700
<font color="yellow">Who is the owner?</font>

457
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,730
<font color="yellow">Kim Dam Ryeong?</font>

458
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,820
<font color="yellow">Even the name is cool. Okay, I'll be right back.</font>

459
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,769
<font color="yellow">Oppa, I need to get back now. It looks like we found the owner of relics we excavated from a wrecked ship.</font>

460
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:08,730
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait. The name of the owner is Dam Yeong?</font>

461
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,090
<font color="yellow">Yes. He was a town head of Heupgok Hyun in Gangwon Province.</font>

462
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,889
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing. Go in.</font>

463
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,119
<font color="yellow">See yo later.</font>

464
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:23,079
<font color="yellow">Keep an eye on Joon Jae and that girl. Make sure they're not doing anything, okay?</font>

465
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,300
<font color="yellow">Dummy.</font>

466
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,119
<font color="yellow">Dummy, dummy.</font>

467
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,599
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

468
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,220
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, why? That's what I want to ask you. Are you going to jump from here?</font>

469
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,690
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it...</font>

470
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,660
<font color="yellow">Don't try to fool me. You even took off your shoes. Stand up, people like this...</font>

471
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,050
<font color="yellow">Sit here.</font>

472
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,430
<font color="yellow">Would you like some barley tea?</font>

473
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,119
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

474
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,190
<font color="yellow">No, wait.</font>

475
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:17,880
<font color="yellow">Let's just talk.</font>

476
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:22,619
<font color="yellow">I've lived here a long time, so I barely remember how to speak language from there.</font>

477
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,139
<font color="yellow">This language is more comfortable.</font>

478
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:27,940
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

479
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,789
<font color="yellow">Hey. Who would've known</font>

480
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,190
<font color="yellow">that I would meet a mermaid in the middle of Seoul?</font>

481
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:40,769
<font color="yellow">I thought I was the only mermaid in Seoul. I was really surprised.</font>

482
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:44,230
<font color="yellow">No, but what were you doing earlier?</font>

483
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,119
<font color="yellow">I was hungry. I don't have money,</font>

484
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,789
<font color="yellow">and it's time for a meal, so I went there to eat.</font>

485
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:52,990
<font color="yellow">You don't have money?</font>

486
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,329
<font color="yellow">Hey, I guess you're usually like that.</font>

487
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:56,980
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

488
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,829
<font color="yellow">You really didn't know this?</font>

489
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,860
<font color="yellow">These are tears. What are you doing?</font>

490
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,789
<font color="yellow">These count as money here.</font>

491
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,590
<font color="yellow">Money? Why?</font>

492
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,139
<font color="yellow">If you don't know, just memorize it. These count as money here.</font>

493
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:19,050
<font color="yellow">And when you start to tear up,</font>

494
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,990
<font color="yellow">just do this and collect all of them.</font>

495
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,019
<font color="yellow">This helped me so much.</font>

496
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:29,410
<font color="yellow">Ah, I cried a couple of times. I should've collected them.</font>

497
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:33,650
<font color="yellow">The bigger they are, the more valuable. So instead of uselessly crying small tears,</font>

498
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:38,590
<font color="yellow">Hold it in, and cry thick tears. Oil.</font>

499
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,400
<font color="yellow">The pink-tinted pearls? The ones that come out when you cry of happiness?</font>

500
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,260
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

501
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,530
<font color="yellow">But as you live here, happy moments</font>

502
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,139
<font color="yellow">that make you tear up don't come often. I cried that kind of tear</font>

503
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,019
<font color="yellow">just once.</font>

504
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:09,460
<font color="yellow">Then I should cry a lot and give all my tears to Heo Joon Jae.</font>

505
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,650
<font color="yellow">Who is Heo Joon Jae?</font>

506
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,650
<font color="yellow">I like him. He's a cool person.</font>

507
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,369
<font color="yellow">Wait, you didn't come up here to see the light?</font>

508
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:28,260
<font color="yellow">You came up here because of a guy you liked?</font>

509
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,880
<font color="yellow">Hey, you really don't know anything.</font>

510
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,789
<font color="yellow">How long has it been since you got here?</font>

511
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:35,829
<font color="yellow">One month.</font>

512
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:39,960
<font color="yellow">The guy you like, is it one side or both sides?</font>

513
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,639
<font color="yellow">So do you like him by yourself or is it mutual?</font>

514
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,550
<font color="yellow">It's just me right now.</font>

515
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:49,200
<font color="yellow">You really didn't calculate anything! You should think before coming up here!</font>

516
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,769
<font color="yellow">Ah, this is why I lived here talking to the fish.</font>

517
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:00,889
<font color="yellow">I told them to call the mermaids. "Don't ever follow a person here." You never heard that?</font>

518
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:02,110
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

519
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:11,800
<font color="yellow">Why can't I? Why can't I follow a person here?</font>

520
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,940
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

521
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,250
<font color="yellow">You have a time limit.</font>

522
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,500
<font color="yellow">The moment that a mermaid leaves the water for land, her heart starts to harden.</font>

523
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,289
<font color="yellow">Even if your legs don't, you heart has a time limit.</font>

524
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,720
<font color="yellow">There is only one way you can continue to breathe</font>

525
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,930
<font color="yellow">and keep your heart beating on land.</font>

526
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,289
<font color="yellow">It is only possible when the person that you love, loves you back.</font>

527
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:49,559
<font color="yellow">That is the only way your heart</font>

528
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,519
<font color="yellow">can continue to beat passionately.</font>

529
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:58,289
<font color="yellow">It isn't too late, so return to the ocean, idiot.</font>

530
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,200
<font color="yellow">So why did you come here without calculating?</font>

531
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,230
<font color="yellow">So, after you left the water,</font>

532
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,590
<font color="yellow">there should've been some motive.</font>

533
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,550
<font color="yellow">That guy said something to you, right?</font>

534
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,860
<font color="yellow">He told me to come to Seoul.</font>

535
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,559
<font color="yellow">That's right. What did he say? Did he ask you to date? To marry?</font>

536
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,889
<font color="yellow">He asked me to go to specialty restaurants.</font>

537
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,660
<font color="yellow">That's it?</font>

538
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,650
<font color="yellow">He also told me to come see the fireworks.</font>

539
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,230
<font color="yellow">Fireworks?</font>

540
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,820
<font color="yellow">I see, you're an easy girl.</font>

541
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,710
<font color="yellow">Can you decide so easily on love with specialty restaurants and fireworks?</font>

542
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,670
<font color="yellow">Did you have some kind of serious romance for one month?</font>

543
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,490
<font color="yellow">Of course. As soon as I saw you,</font>

544
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,619
<font color="yellow">Should I help you?</font>

545
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,130
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

546
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,230
<font color="yellow">Jealousy?</font>

547
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,880
<font color="yellow">If you don't know, memorize. Jealousy</font>

548
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,550
<font color="yellow">is the fastest path to love.</font>

549
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,769
<font color="yellow">â¬  No, no, no, no, no â¬</font>

550
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,329
<font color="yellow">I think it would be good if we started with a makeover.</font>

551
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:19,590
<font color="yellow">Should we try to get some money for shopping?</font>

552
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,900
<font color="yellow">Hold it. Hold it,</font>

553
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,289
<font color="yellow">and then cry thick. Thick tears.</font>

554
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,460
<font color="yellow">Chae Wa. I love you.</font>

555
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,829
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

556
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:03,480
<font color="yellow">Hello. I've heard a lot about you.</font>

557
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,190
<font color="yellow">Who... are you?</font>

558
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,090
<font color="yellow">I'm Yoo Jeong Hoon.</font>

559
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,789
<font color="yellow">Please take care of me in the future.</font>

560
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:09,930
<font color="yellow">Take care of what?</font>

561
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,829
<font color="yellow">- Our darling...<br>- Excuse me?</font>

562
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:14,980
<font color="yellow">I heard she was living in this house for a bit.</font>

563
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,930
<font color="yellow">I heard it was a house full of men, so I was a bit concerned. But now that I see you,</font>

564
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,960
<font color="yellow">I'm assured.</font>

565
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:27,389
<font color="yellow">You're assured? I don't think I have that kind of face.</font>

566
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:29,200
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

567
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:36,260
<font color="yellow">Dear, how about you tie your hair tomorrow? Your neck is pretty.</font>

568
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:42,490
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

569
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:46,900
<font color="yellow">Hey. Go in now.</font>

570
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,099
<font color="yellow">Go first.</font>

571
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,829
<font color="yellow">- Go in first.<br>- No, you leave first.</font>

572
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:57,829
<font color="yellow">I'll be more at ease if I see you go in.</font>

573
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:59,360
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. Leave first.</font>

574
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,400
<font color="yellow">- Just go in first.<br>- No, leave first.</font>

575
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,289
<font color="yellow">I'll leave after I see you go in.</font>

576
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:06,099
<font color="yellow">He said go in!</font>

577
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:08,240
<font color="yellow">Just go inside!</font>

578
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,059
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

579
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:14,400
<font color="yellow">Why again?</font>

580
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,599
<font color="yellow">I just want to see her face one more time.</font>

581
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,240
<font color="yellow">Click.</font>

582
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,300
<font color="yellow">I'm taking a picture. I'll be looking at it when I miss you tonight.</font>

583
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:30,599
<font color="yellow">Like this? Click. Click, click, click.</font>

584
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,200
<font color="yellow">Ah, you're so cute.</font>

585
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,860
<font color="yellow">Hey. Go inside.</font>

586
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,849
<font color="yellow">He isn't the type of guy to drink and drive.</font>

587
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:54,340
<font color="yellow">I can't understand it either.</font>

588
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,329
<font color="yellow">We decided to eat altogether.</font>

589
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:05,070
<font color="yellow">But, why? Why did he drink and go all the way there?</font>

590
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,150
<font color="yellow">It seems like an intentional accident.</font>

591
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:17,280
<font color="yellow">How could it be? The police says it's a driving under the influence case.</font>

592
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,510
<font color="yellow">It will just make things harder for you to think that way.</font>

593
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,610
<font color="yellow">It's me. Me!</font>

594
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,920
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

595
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,880
<font color="yellow">- Hey, let me look at the bracelet. Just once!<br>- Are you going at it again?</font>

596
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,670
<font color="yellow">- I just want to confirm something.<br>- Confirm what?</font>

597
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,490
<font color="yellow">There is something.</font>

598
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,740
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to tell me the truth?</font>

599
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:12,180
<font color="yellow">Well, Si Ah is currently working on artifacts from shipwreck.</font>

600
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,519
<font color="yellow">The artifacts belonged to someone named Dam Ryeong.</font>

601
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,780
<font color="yellow">Isn't it interesting? It is possible that they are two different people with same name.</font>

602
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,769
<font color="yellow">However, if it's the same person</font>

603
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:28,480
<font color="yellow">it will be more than $6 million! Let me have it appraised at least.</font>

604
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,789
<font color="yellow">Hyeong,</font>

605
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:32,690
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I keep that bracelet?</font>

606
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,720
<font color="yellow">I'll return it to Cheong when she leaves. If I give it back to her now,</font>

607
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,300
<font color="yellow">people like you won't leave it alone.</font>

608
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,440
<font color="yellow">You are really strange these days.</font>

609
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,769
<font color="yellow">Do you all of sudden aspire to be a decent human being?</font>

610
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,230
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

611
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:05,300
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, you're scary. I'm leaving.</font>

612
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,079
<font color="yellow">Se Hwa!</font>

613
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:29,230
<font color="yellow">Strange things keep happening since I've met that dummy.</font>

614
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,660
<font color="yellow">Whoa, my Cheong, did you know how to doll up?</font>

615
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:54,160
<font color="yellow">Whoa, dressed like that, you look beautiful!</font>

616
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,039
<font color="yellow">Doesn't she, Tae Oh? Look at him, he's speechless. Whoa.</font>

617
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,700
<font color="yellow">What the...?</font>

618
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,590
<font color="yellow">It's cold. It's winter.</font>

619
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:08,110
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, Cheong's also wearing a skirt!</font>

620
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,639
<font color="yellow">Go change.</font>

621
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:12,940
<font color="yellow">Why? It's the one you bought it for me last time.</font>

622
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,579
<font color="yellow">- Do you think I bought it for you to wear going outside?<br>- You didn't?</font>

623
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:20,539
<font color="yellow">I bought it for you to hang in the closet.</font>

624
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:23,110
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes sense?</font>

625
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:29,309
<font color="yellow">Of course it does! Not all clothes are made for wearing. Some are made for being hung in the closet!</font>

626
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,570
<font color="yellow">Go change it to pants and leave your hair untied.</font>

627
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,320
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you trying to regulate her her hair and clothing? Are you her student affairs teacher?</font>

628
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:44,190
<font color="yellow">I'm the house owner. Hyeong, you too go and change your clothes as well! Are you a Rudoph?</font>

629
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,480
<font color="yellow">You'd better listen to me. If you don't want to, then leave.</font>

630
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,369
<font color="yellow">Whoa, my Cheong, your chopstick skills have improved a lot!</font>

631
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:08,430
<font color="yellow">Cheong, where are you going today? Do you want me to give you a ride?</font>

632
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,670
<font color="yellow">Yes, I have plans later...</font>

633
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:15,090
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you need to clean the house or something to pay for your stay here?</font>

634
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,789
<font color="yellow">Of course, I can clean. I saw Tae Oh does it.</font>

635
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:22,430
<font color="yellow">It's quite dusty these days because we haven't been able to open the windows to circulate the air as it's been cold.</font>

636
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,369
<font color="yellow">Wipe down well so there won't be any dust.</font>

637
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:25,710
<font color="yellow">I can do that.</font>

638
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,920
<font color="yellow">It's my house. I'll make whomever I want to do it.</font>

639
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,670
<font color="yellow">Also, you'll see a fan in the storage. It will be dusty.</font>

640
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,360
<font color="yellow">We won't use it until next summer.</font>

641
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,030
<font color="yellow">That's why we have to clean it now.</font>

642
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,829
<font color="yellow">Are you the evil step-mother? (as in Cinderella &amp; etc) Cheong, just go out without doing it.</font>

643
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:45,230
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare! You won't be able to go before you finish them all.</font>

644
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,090
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

645
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,160
<font color="yellow">I forgot my phone.</font>

646
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,559
<font color="yellow">Ah, it feels nice!</font>

647
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:12,650
<font color="yellow">Why do you think the mermaids are brink of extinction?</font>

648
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,570
<font color="yellow">Because we don't change.</font>

649
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:23,720
<font color="yellow">Humans change but we don't change like idiots. That's why we get stabbed in the back.</font>

650
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,660
<font color="yellow">Humans change?</font>

651
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,550
<font color="yellow">They do. The woman I loved did, too.</font>

652
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,410
<font color="yellow">Even though she said she'd love me forever.</font>

653
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:40,280
<font color="yellow">When she found about who I am, she left. Just like that.</font>

654
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,200
<font color="yellow">At first, I was regretting coming to the land</font>

655
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,750
<font color="yellow">It was hard, but it's our reality</font>

656
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:03,059
<font color="yellow">There is no human on earth who can accept us as the way we are.</font>

657
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,410
<font color="yellow">The man you love is the same.</font>

658
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:16,570
<font color="yellow">So, get your act together</font>

659
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,440
<font color="yellow">and don't ever get caught.</font>

660
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:40,710
<font color="yellow">Epilogue</font>

661
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,440
<font color="yellow">Hello, could I have your moment?</font>

662
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,050
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, but could I ask what you do for living?</font>

663
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,349
<font color="yellow">I'm a public officer.</font>

664
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:52,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

665
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:58,130
<font color="yellow">You know public officers. We don't make big money,</font>

666
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,250
<font color="yellow">but our jobs are tenured and have a pension.</font>

667
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:06,490
<font color="yellow">Frankly, it is a job to provide support for someone comfortably.</font>

668
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,539
<font color="yellow">Ah, I do know that, but...</font>

669
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:11,309
<font color="yellow">Could I ask you a question?</font>

670
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:15,210
<font color="yellow">What do you do, Mr. Heo Joon Jae?</font>

671
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,639
<font color="yellow">If it's hard to answer, you don't need to.</font>

672
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:26,650
<font color="yellow">Anyways, please do take a good care of my Cheong.</font>

673
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,610
<font color="yellow">Well, you don't need to ask me for that. I will make sure..</font>

674
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:33,849
<font color="yellow">I mean, WE will figure it out.</font>

675
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:44,480
<font color="yellow">You would think the time is... And the opportunities are... Always available to you, don't you?</font>

676
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,630
<font color="yellow">They are not!</font>

677
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:57,360
<font color="yellow">What is he? What is he babbling about? Acting all cool.</font>

678
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,400
<font color="yellow">He's a joke, seriously!</font>
