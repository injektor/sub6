00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,614
<font color="yellow">Did you see your husband?</font>

4
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:33,314
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

5
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:35,444
<font color="yellow">I'm here on business.</font>

6
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:39,814
<font color="yellow">Looking after your husband who's behind bars...</font>

7
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:41,444
<font color="yellow">while dating another man.</font>

8
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:44,084
<font color="yellow">You must be very busy.</font>

9
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:47,414
<font color="yellow">I have no time for nonsense. I'd like to get going.</font>

10
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,844
<font color="yellow">You dumped your husband...</font>

11
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:52,743
<font color="yellow">to take someone else's.</font>

12
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:56,043
<font color="yellow">What a horrid hobby.</font>

13
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,183
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say.</font>

14
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:03,884
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

15
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:05,183
<font color="yellow">Who do I think I am?</font>

16
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:11,384
<font color="yellow">I have a right to say that as an ex-wife of Lee Dong Jin.</font>

17
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:13,213
<font color="yellow">You are not his wife now.</font>

18
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:15,513
<font color="yellow">You are his ex-wife.</font>

19
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:17,784
<font color="yellow">I don't think you have the right to say that kind of words.</font>

20
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:20,614
<font color="yellow">- What? - People have their own stories.</font>

21
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:24,183
<font color="yellow">Don't stick your nose if you don't know what's going on here.</font>

22
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:26,884
<font color="yellow">Lee Dong Jin is...</font>

23
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:30,144
<font color="yellow">a much better person than those people like you.</font>

24
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:32,213
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about him.</font>

25
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,013
<font color="yellow">You are one of those girls...</font>

26
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,944
<font color="yellow">who take advantage of men with compassion.</font>

27
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:44,384
<font color="yellow">Those people like you make me sick.</font>

28
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:49,284
<font color="yellow">You're pathetic.</font>

29
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:41,183
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

30
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:44,383
<font color="yellow">You're back. How did it go?</font>

31
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:47,443
<font color="yellow">I had a meeting with the chief director of product division.</font>

32
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,383
<font color="yellow">It went better than I had expected.</font>

33
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,614
<font color="yellow">You are amazing.</font>

34
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:56,213
<font color="yellow">I never dreamed of selling our products in a department store.</font>

35
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:57,614
<font color="yellow">Neither did I.</font>

36
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:01,343
<font color="yellow">We have our own pattern making method.</font>

37
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:04,114
<font color="yellow">I think we have a shot, but we must try our best though.</font>

38
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,544
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Na Yun Shil?</font>

39
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:10,544
<font color="yellow">She rushed out of after receiving a call a while ago.</font>

40
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,443
<font color="yellow">- A phone call? - Yun Shil said...</font>

41
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,014
<font color="yellow">she should visit the prison.</font>

42
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,883
<font color="yellow">- The prison? - Yes.</font>

43
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,514
<font color="yellow">What is going on in your mind?</font>

44
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,283
<font color="yellow">I replaced the broken windows...</font>

45
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,014
<font color="yellow">and installed surveillance cameras.</font>

46
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:33,783
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry from now on.</font>

47
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:38,584
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you where you have been?</font>

48
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:41,484
<font color="yellow">I've been to Gi Pyo.</font>

49
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:44,144
<font color="yellow">I asked him to let go of me...</font>

50
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,484
<font color="yellow">and stop harassing us.</font>

51
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,783
<font color="yellow">I thought I have to confront him...</font>

52
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,783
<font color="yellow">and tell him what I think.</font>

53
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,183
<font color="yellow">You must be tired after the visit in this cold weather.</font>

54
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,084
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I didn't tell you before I go.</font>

55
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,243
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with that.</font>

56
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,484
<font color="yellow">I'm happy if you're comfortable after all.</font>

57
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,644
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside and have some hot drink.</font>

58
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:11,843
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

59
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:14,644
<font color="yellow">I met her.</font>

60
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:18,983
<font color="yellow">I mean Min Hyo Joo.</font>

61
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:22,184
<font color="yellow">You met her in the prison?</font>

62
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,783
<font color="yellow">This is Min Hyo Joo.</font>

63
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:29,814
<font color="yellow">I met your son a while ago.</font>

64
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,244
<font color="yellow">The lawyer said he will do his best.</font>

65
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:35,543
<font color="yellow">I think Mr. Hong Gi Pyo will be free on parole.</font>

66
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:39,584
<font color="yellow">Is that true? My goodness. I'm so thankful.</font>

67
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:42,584
<font color="yellow">We'll never forget what you have done for us.</font>

68
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:45,413
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

69
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,744
<font color="yellow">You can thank me when your son gets out.</font>

70
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,514
<font color="yellow">By the way, about your daughter-in-law,</font>

71
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:56,644
<font color="yellow">you should keep a close eye on her until Mr. Hong Gi Pyo gets out.</font>

72
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:06,283
<font color="yellow">Am I in the wrong room?</font>

73
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,744
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

74
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:14,913
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

75
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,384
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

76
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:23,043
<font color="yellow">You should go to your new room.</font>

77
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,814
<font color="yellow">New room? What do you mean?</font>

78
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:27,684
<font color="yellow">- Your girlfriend. - What?</font>

79
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:29,514
<font color="yellow">Your girlfriend moved your stuff to a VIP room.</font>

80
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:33,413
<font color="yellow">She made an advance payment of 10 months.</font>

81
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,014
<font color="yellow">My goodness. My girlfriend...</font>

82
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,213
<font color="yellow">What am I talking?</font>

83
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:39,913
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyo Won?</font>

84
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:42,983
<font color="yellow">She invited all the guests here for a house warming,</font>

85
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,144
<font color="yellow">I mean room warming.</font>

86
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,983
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

87
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,384
<font color="yellow">Please help yourselves.</font>

88
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,483
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Thank you.</font>

89
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:01,913
<font color="yellow">Also, please be friendly with Tae Yang.</font>

90
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:03,713
<font color="yellow">- We'll surely do so. - Don't worry about that.</font>

91
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:05,543
<font color="yellow">I've seen so many couples,</font>

92
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:09,314
<font color="yellow">but you're the best girlfriend ever, Hyo Won.</font>

93
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:12,944
<font color="yellow">You're the modern Shin Sa Im Dang.</font>

94
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,783
<font color="yellow">I agree with you.</font>

95
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:17,283
<font color="yellow">Let's applaud for...</font>

96
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,884
<font color="yellow">Min Hyo Won, the modern Shin Sa Im Dang!</font>

97
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:27,744
<font color="yellow">I know I'm in no way perfect,</font>

98
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,084
<font color="yellow">but you think highly of me.</font>

99
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:30,944
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

100
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:36,113
<font color="yellow">I'll try harder from now on.</font>

101
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,913
<font color="yellow">Attention, everyone!</font>

102
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:42,213
<font color="yellow">The owner of...</font>

103
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:44,884
<font color="yellow">the VIP room has just arrived!</font>

104
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:50,514
<font color="yellow">- Good luck. - Congratulations on your marriage.</font>

105
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,644
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - What are you doing here?</font>

106
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,884
<font color="yellow">The manager called to say the VIP room was empty,</font>

107
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:56,983
<font color="yellow">so I signed the contract.</font>

108
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:59,384
<font color="yellow">The room's huge,</font>

109
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:01,644
<font color="yellow">has an en suite bathroom and an air conditioner.</font>

110
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,314
<font color="yellow">This is paradise.</font>

111
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:09,244
<font color="yellow">I'll move back to my old room.</font>

112
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:15,413
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I know why you're doing this,</font>

113
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:19,144
<font color="yellow">but you did so without discussing it with me.</font>

114
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,913
<font color="yellow">That's like insulting the life I lived so far.</font>

115
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,113
<font color="yellow">It can't be an insult.</font>

116
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:27,384
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

117
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:43,983
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

118
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,043
<font color="yellow">tried to...</font>

119
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,514
<font color="yellow">think of ways to make your life more comfortable.</font>

120
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:53,283
<font color="yellow">I did this thinking you'd be really pleased.</font>

121
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,543
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing this,</font>

122
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,613
<font color="yellow">it'll make me look like I like you for your money.</font>

123
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:03,684
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

124
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,043
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

125
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,684
<font color="yellow">Don't make me look bad.</font>

126
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:10,483
<font color="yellow">Please don't.</font>

127
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,913
<font color="yellow">I didn't think hard enough.</font>

128
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,644
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

129
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,444
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

130
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,913
<font color="yellow">You're poor but strong.</font>

131
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,144
<font color="yellow">You're proud and upright.</font>

132
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,443
<font color="yellow">I picked a great guy.</font>

133
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,583
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

134
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:47,244
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

135
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,413
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

136
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,644
<font color="yellow">I went to a department store...</font>

137
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,443
<font color="yellow">and bought things for your mum.</font>

138
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,144
<font color="yellow">Is that bad?</font>

139
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:17,884
<font color="yellow">Would giving her this...</font>

140
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,744
<font color="yellow">also insult the life you lived...</font>

141
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:23,244
<font color="yellow">so far?</font>

142
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,583
<font color="yellow">My mum farms and works by the sea.</font>

143
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:29,443
<font color="yellow">She doesn't need such luxury goods.</font>

144
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:38,984
<font color="yellow">These will keep her warm when she works outdoors.</font>

145
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,183
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

146
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:58,183
<font color="yellow">I'll return everything tomorrow.</font>

147
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:02,083
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

148
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,313
<font color="yellow">If you feel bad,</font>

149
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,083
<font color="yellow">shall we send her these?</font>

150
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:15,144
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

151
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:21,783
<font color="yellow">Don't thank me.</font>

152
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,614
<font color="yellow">I should thank you.</font>

153
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:26,714
<font color="yellow">No. You acknowledged my efforts.</font>

154
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:28,083
<font color="yellow">I should thank you.</font>

155
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,813
<font color="yellow">I was very impressed, you know.</font>

156
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:38,744
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be...</font>

157
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,943

00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,314
<font color="yellow">Why all of a sudden?</font>

313
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,943
<font color="yellow">I couldn't enjoy the foliage last fall.</font>

314
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:47,784
<font color="yellow">Let's soak in some hot water.</font>

315
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,713
<font color="yellow">We can just go to a bathhouse. Why would we go so far?</font>

316
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:54,753
<font color="yellow">Just take me to enjoy the cherry blossoms next spring.</font>

317
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,183
<font color="yellow">Cherry blossoms.</font>

318
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,584
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. I don't know if I can.</font>

319
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,144
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

320
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,614
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's do that.</font>

321
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:11,183
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to work. - Okay.</font>

322
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,784
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

323
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:15,443
<font color="yellow">Why does he keep reporting things like that?</font>

324
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:18,884
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

325
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,644
<font color="yellow">I told you to clip the roots...</font>

326
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,683
<font color="yellow">and you took off the heads.</font>

327
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:25,913
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What a waste.</font>

328
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:28,513
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was thinking about something else.</font>

329
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:32,983
<font color="yellow">I said to go to the room and rest. Why are you causing trouble?</font>

330
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:34,513
<font color="yellow">I'll get some chilli paste.</font>

331
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:36,084
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

332
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:46,814
<font color="yellow">The water is overflowing. Wait.</font>

333
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,753
<font color="yellow">Stay right there. My goodness.</font>

334
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,443
<font color="yellow">Do you feel unwell?</font>

335
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,314
<font color="yellow">No. I'm just a little dizzy all of a sudden.</font>

336
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:00,044
<font color="yellow">I'll take you.</font>

337
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,013
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

338
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:09,413
<font color="yellow">Okay. Take it slowly.</font>

339
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,253
<font color="yellow">Do you get dizzy often?</font>

340
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:19,814
<font color="yellow">I'm old, so it happens occasionally. Thanks.</font>

341
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:23,384
<font color="yellow">I see. I get like that when I'm not feeling well, too.</font>

342
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,443
<font color="yellow">- Tae Pyung. - Yes, Father.</font>

343
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,753
<font color="yellow">Nothing in life is easy.</font>

344
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,114
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's more so...</font>

345
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:31,844
<font color="yellow">- with relationships. - I see.</font>

346
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,483
<font color="yellow">When I married my wife,</font>

347
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,084
<font color="yellow">I had a very tough time because I was a poor tailor.</font>

348
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:40,144
<font color="yellow">Don't be hurt and be strong.</font>

349
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:43,443
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Hearing you say that...</font>

350
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:45,584
<font color="yellow">makes me feel much better.</font>

351
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:48,314
<font color="yellow">Please rest. I'll go now.</font>

352
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,884
<font color="yellow">Okay. I need to lie down.</font>

353
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,314
<font color="yellow">Here is the pillow.</font>

354
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:59,784
<font color="yellow">I see. That's where it was.</font>

355
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:21,753
<font color="yellow">(Oh Young Eun Bakery)</font>

356
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:32,114
<font color="yellow">Young Eun.</font>

357
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:36,413
<font color="yellow">Do you know who I am?</font>

358
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,144
<font color="yellow">It's me, Sam Do.</font>

359
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,013
<font color="yellow">Is that too boring?</font>

360
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:47,814
<font color="yellow">Look who this is!</font>

361
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:52,183
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Young Eun? Wang Young Eun?</font>

362
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:54,844
<font color="yellow">No, Oh Young Eun!</font>

363
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,213
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Long time no see.</font>

364
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:58,943
<font color="yellow">What are you doing there?</font>

365
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:02,413
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you're working late?</font>

366
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,443
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

367
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,384
<font color="yellow">But my head hurt, so I left early.</font>

368
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,144
<font color="yellow">I can just go in early tomorrow.</font>

369
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:09,983
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you go home then?</font>

370
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:11,844
<font color="yellow">I was too hungry so I wanted to have some bread.</font>

371
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:14,844
<font color="yellow">What? You should go home and eat a proper meal,</font>

372
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:16,683
<font color="yellow">not snack on pastries.</font>

373
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,144
<font color="yellow">I bought two fresh fish at the market.</font>

374
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:23,483
<font color="yellow">I'll cook up a nice and spicy stew with radish.</font>

375
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,243
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Let's go.</font>

376
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:29,784
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you coming?</font>

377
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:30,983
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

378
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,314
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

379
00:22:51,314 --> 00:22:52,443
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

380
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:56,183
<font color="yellow">What is it? Does it taste bad?</font>

381
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,084
<font color="yellow">No. The broth is nice.</font>

382
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:01,013
<font color="yellow">Then why are you picking at it?</font>

383
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,413
<font color="yellow">I don't have an appetite.</font>

384
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,114
<font color="yellow">But honey.</font>

385
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:09,743
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever wear dresses?</font>

386
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:13,443
<font color="yellow">You'd look much prettier with a pretty shawl, too.</font>

387
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:15,644
<font color="yellow">I stand in front of a fryer all day frying chicken.</font>

388
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,713
<font color="yellow">Why would I wear a dress and a shawl?</font>

389
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:20,844
<font color="yellow">Why are you complaining about my clothes?</font>

390
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:23,743
<font color="yellow">I just think you'd look much more elegant and prettier...</font>

391
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,983
<font color="yellow">if you dressed up a little, that's all.</font>

392
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:27,784
<font color="yellow">Give me a bouquet of money.</font>

393
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:30,713
<font color="yellow">I'll transform into the most sophisticated and elegant woman,</font>

394
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:33,084
<font color="yellow">so much that the wealthy wives will cry when they see me.</font>

395
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,743
<font color="yellow">You're making me lose my appetite.</font>

396
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,114
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I didn't even realise.</font>

397
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:45,243
<font color="yellow">How does a woman not know how to be bashful?</font>

398
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:48,943
<font color="yellow">Why would I be bashful? We've slept in the same bed for years.</font>

399
00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:51,084
<font color="yellow">I'm not that fake.</font>

400
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,044
<font color="yellow">That isn't about being fake, it's basic manners.</font>

401
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:54,413
<font color="yellow">We're eating.</font>

402
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:58,884
<font color="yellow">If you're so upset, you can fart, too. Then we'll be even.</font>

403
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:03,144
<font color="yellow">Seriously. Just go to the bathroom.</font>

404
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,284
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

405
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:21,284
<font color="yellow">From this angle, I can't tell whether the mannequin is you...</font>

406
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:23,683
<font color="yellow">if you are the mannequin.</font>

407
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:25,814
<font color="yellow">You're embarrassing me.</font>

408
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,513
<font color="yellow">Did you say bye to my mum?</font>

409
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:30,013
<font color="yellow">Of course. I did say bye,</font>

410
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:31,784
<font color="yellow">but she wouldn't even make an eye contact.</font>

411
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:35,284
<font color="yellow">She'll give in eventually. Why is she stalling so much?</font>

412
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,314
<font color="yellow">Will she give in?</font>

413
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:40,814
<font color="yellow">I told you not to worry. She has no hopes for me.</font>

414
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,614
<font color="yellow">She went all in on Dong Jin.</font>

415
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,213
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't go all in.</font>

416
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:47,814
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

417
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,144
<font color="yellow">What I mean is,</font>

418
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,743
<font color="yellow">she'll probably be very picky...</font>

419
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:56,483
<font color="yellow">when choosing a wife for Dong Jin later on.</font>

420
00:24:56,483 --> 00:25:00,084
<font color="yellow">Of course. She had a corporate heiress as a daughter-in-law.</font>

421
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:02,743
<font color="yellow">She won't permit anyone just average.</font>

422
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:06,743
<font color="yellow">You're right. It'll be a big pain.</font>

423
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:08,983
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Dong Jin.</font>

424
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:12,114
<font color="yellow">He's always been smart about looking out for himself.</font>

425
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:14,983
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about us.</font>

426
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:19,544
<font color="yellow">What am I doing? You need to go to work.</font>

427
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:20,683
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

428
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:21,713
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

429
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:24,983
<font color="yellow">I feel so secure, since your father is backing me up.</font>

430
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,683
<font color="yellow">But is your father ill?</font>

431
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,284
<font color="yellow">No. My dad's healthy. Why?</font>

432
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:34,314
<font color="yellow">Nothing. It's just that he didn't look so well.</font>

433
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,983
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I was just asking.</font>

434
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:38,844
<font color="yellow">I'll be late. I should go.</font>

435
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:41,044
<font color="yellow">Wait. I'll come to your work after I finish.</font>

436
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:43,743
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's not a nice place. Don't come.</font>

437
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,114
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at home.</font>

438
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:51,544
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

439
00:25:56,144 --> 00:25:59,284
<font color="yellow">It's not like I come all the time. I haven't come in a while.</font>

440
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:01,983
<font color="yellow">Must I cook for myself? Does that make you happy?</font>

441
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:05,183
<font color="yellow">You wicked thing. You evil thing.</font>

442
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:07,483
<font color="yellow">I saw Gi Pyo this afternoon.</font>

443
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,544
<font color="yellow">- You went to visit him? - Yes.</font>

444
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:12,584
<font color="yellow">I asked him to let me go.</font>

445
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,284
<font color="yellow">You're determined to kill my son!</font>

446
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,584
<font color="yellow">It's hard enough for him to even survive.</font>

447
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:19,943
<font color="yellow">What stupid nonsense did you say to him?</font>

448
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:21,384
<font color="yellow">It wasn't nonsense.</font>

449
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:22,983
<font color="yellow">You're blinded by some guy,</font>

450
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:25,443
<font color="yellow">that you disrespect your husband and mother-in-law.</font>

451
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:28,213
<font color="yellow">You despicable, dirty witch!</font>

452
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:33,943
<font color="yellow">I'll stick to you like glue...</font>

453
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:35,614
<font color="yellow">and guard you...</font>

454
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:38,683
<font color="yellow">like a hound until Gi Pyo gets out. Got it?</font>

455
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:46,013
<font color="yellow">It's late, so you can sleep here,</font>

456
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:47,644
<font color="yellow">but please leave in the morning.</font>

457
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:51,483
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Where are you going?</font>

458
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,544
<font color="yellow">Why that...</font>

459
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,513
<font color="yellow">That wicked thing.</font>

460
00:26:56,513 --> 00:26:57,784
<font color="yellow">I'm so angry.</font>

461
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,683
<font color="yellow">That wicked little brat.</font>

462
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:02,513
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

463
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:11,084
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

464
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:23,844
<font color="yellow">(Mr Pretty Eyes)</font>

465
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,983
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Hi. Did you eat yet?</font>

466
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:30,384
<font color="yellow">I just ate. What about you?</font>

467
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:32,483
<font color="yellow">I'm just having a burger.</font>

468
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,114
<font color="yellow">Should I bring you some food?</font>

469
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:36,413
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. I'm full now. - Oh, gosh.</font>

470
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,983
<font color="yellow">I'll stop by on my way home.</font>

471
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,683
<font color="yellow">- Make me instant noodles. - No.</font>

472
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:43,544
<font color="yellow">- What? - You can't come over.</font>

473
00:27:43,743 --> 00:27:46,084
<font color="yellow">- Why not? - I'm going to sleep early.</font>

474
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:47,983
<font color="yellow">Do you feel sick?</font>

475
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:51,584
<font color="yellow">No, but I'm tired, so I want to rest.</font>

476
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:54,443
<font color="yellow">Are you hiding someone at home?</font>

477
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:55,814
<font color="yellow">Like who?</font>

478
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:58,644
<font color="yellow">A young and handsome man?</font>

479
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,314
<font color="yellow">- What was that? - Rest, then.</font>

480
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:03,513
<font color="yellow">I'll call later.</font>

481
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:05,614
<font color="yellow">Okay. You must be tired.</font>

482
00:28:05,614 --> 00:28:08,483
<font color="yellow">Don't stop by. Go straight home, okay?</font>

483
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:14,013
<font color="yellow">Why does she keep saying not to come over?</font>

484
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:17,614
<font color="yellow">Is she sick of me already?</font>

485
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:30,844
<font color="yellow">She really has to leave tomorrow.</font>

486
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,943
<font color="yellow">Don't be mean to your mother-in-law.</font>

487
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:40,213
<font color="yellow">Your husband is being released soon.</font>

488
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:43,013
<font color="yellow">Someone up there must have known how wronged Gi Pyo was,</font>

489
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,784
<font color="yellow">and gave him a helping hand.</font>

490
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:00,983
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

491
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,814
<font color="yellow">for creating trouble.</font>

492
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,183
<font color="yellow">I know you did it for me.</font>

493
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:10,159
<font color="yellow">That VIP room...</font>

494
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:13,144
<font color="yellow">was nice and big,</font>

495
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:14,943
<font color="yellow">and had its own shower...</font>

496
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:17,243
<font color="yellow">and an air conditioner.</font>

497
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,750
<font color="yellow">It was so nice.</font>

498
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,713
<font color="yellow">Once I get a job and make money, I'll move into the VIP room.</font>

499
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,243
<font color="yellow">Do you mean it?</font>

500
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:33,513
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

501
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:45,544
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mum.</font>

502
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:47,213
<font color="yellow">Is Tae Yang with you?</font>

503
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:49,644
<font color="yellow">- Naturally. - Let me talk to him.</font>

504
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:52,844
<font color="yellow">My mum wants to talk to you.</font>

505
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:57,013
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Ma'am. - What time is it?</font>

506
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,983
<font color="yellow">Why are you keeping her out so late?</font>

507
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:02,943
<font color="yellow">- It's only 8:30pm. - Okay.</font>

508
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:05,413
<font color="yellow">Our curfew is 9pm,</font>

509
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,413
<font color="yellow">so send her home right now.</font>

510
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:09,044
<font color="yellow">Curfew is 9pm?</font>

511
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:14,013
<font color="yellow">Since when did we have a curfew?</font>

512
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,983
<font color="yellow">Starting today.</font>

513
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,243
<font color="yellow">How could you set a 9pm curfew for your daughter...</font>

514
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,713
<font color="yellow">- who just started dating? - Forget it, if you don't like it.</font>

515
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:22,513
<font color="yellow">I'll just take back...</font>

516
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,413
<font color="yellow">saying you to may date.</font>

517
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,983
<font color="yellow">- Not that! - Then stick to your curfew.</font>

518
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:31,743
<font color="yellow">We haven't even had dinner yet.</font>

519
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:33,644
<font color="yellow">Then eat at home.</font>

520
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,044
<font color="yellow">You'll save money, too.</font>

521
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:37,114
<font color="yellow">Mum says to come over for dinner.</font>

522
00:30:40,683 --> 00:30:42,544
<font color="yellow">- No? - Tae Yang.</font>

523
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:45,284
<font color="yellow">You don't want to eat with me?</font>

524
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:47,413
<font color="yellow">No, we're coming right now.</font>

525
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:53,584
<font color="yellow">My mum is so clueless.</font>

526
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:57,183
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

527
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:01,243
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Let's hurry back before we miss your curfew.</font>

528
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:02,713
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

529
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,513
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - What have you been doing?</font>

530
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:17,243
<font color="yellow">I stayed with him at his job...</font>

531
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:18,943
<font color="yellow">and then we hung out in the gosiwon.</font>

532
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:22,983
<font color="yellow">- Let's sit down and talk. - Yes, Ma'am.</font>

533
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:36,814
<font color="yellow">How long will you work at the burger joint?</font>

534
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,483
<font color="yellow">I think I'll have to work there until I get a full-time job.</font>

535
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:40,884
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

536
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:42,784
<font color="yellow">Return to the company.</font>

537
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:44,284
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

538
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:45,614
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

539
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:49,044
<font color="yellow">Would you want to go back to the company that wrongfully fired you?</font>

540
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,443
<font color="yellow">And Hyo Sang is still there.</font>

541
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,284
<font color="yellow">Then let's draw a big picture.</font>

542
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:57,983
<font color="yellow">Study for the bar exam.</font>

543
00:31:58,243 --> 00:32:00,443
<font color="yellow">I'll support you all the way.</font>

544
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,243
<font color="yellow">The bar exam? Why...</font>

545
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,743
<font color="yellow">That's the best way for raising your social status.</font>

546
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:07,584
<font color="yellow">If you pass the bar exam,</font>

547
00:32:07,814 --> 00:32:10,183
<font color="yellow">I'll let you marry Hyo Won without complaint.</font>

548
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:11,844
<font color="yellow">I'm so humiliated.</font>

549
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:13,513
<font color="yellow">Don't you watch the news?</font>

550
00:32:14,213 --> 00:32:15,884
<font color="yellow">They're getting rid of the bar exam.</font>

551
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,084
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

552
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:18,784
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

553
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:22,483
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

554
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,844
<font color="yellow">I nap early evenings,</font>

555
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,983
<font color="yellow">so I don't watch the news.</font>

556
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:30,114
<font color="yellow">What about the Civil Service Exam?</font>

557
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:33,013
<font color="yellow">- The Civil Service Exam? - Once you pass the exam...</font>

558
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,084
<font color="yellow">and work at various important posts,</font>

559
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:36,943
<font color="yellow">you can enter politics. What do you say?</font>

560
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:38,913
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in that field at all.</font>

561
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:41,943
<font color="yellow">You don't like this or that. Then what?</font>

562
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:44,314
<font color="yellow">You need a good job,</font>

563
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:47,114
<font color="yellow">- so it'll be less embarrassing. - Mum!</font>

564
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:51,644
<font color="yellow">- I'm still young, so... - You're not young any more.</font>

565
00:32:52,084 --> 00:32:54,243
<font color="yellow">You can't do part time jobs forever.</font>

566
00:32:54,884 --> 00:32:55,884
<font color="yellow">Just what...</font>

567
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,183
<font color="yellow">- is your dream? - Mum, please!</font>

568
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,713
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

569
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:02,943
<font color="yellow">Did I offend you?</font>

570
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:04,584
<font color="yellow">No, Ma'am.</font>

571
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:11,743
<font color="yellow">This is Min Hyo Sang. Come to the office right now.</font>

572
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:15,314
<font color="yellow">I should go now.</font>

573
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:18,713
<font color="yellow">But you didn't even have dinner.</font>

574
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,513
<font color="yellow">Are you angry because of what I said?</font>

575
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,943
<font color="yellow">I am definitely not. Everything you said was correct.</font>

576
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,814
<font color="yellow">Then why are you suddenly leaving?</font>

577
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:28,584
<font color="yellow">Our housekeeper is setting the dinner table.</font>

578
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:30,413
<font color="yellow">I forgot I had dinner plans.</font>

579
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:33,284
<font color="yellow">I'll come back another time. Please feed me, then.</font>

580
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:41,614
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say, will you?</font>

581
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:43,544
<font color="yellow">What did I say?</font>

582
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:46,243
<font color="yellow">I'll walk you to the gate!</font>

583
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:52,483
<font color="yellow">Was I a bit harsh?</font>

584
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:02,183
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

585
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:06,213
<font color="yellow">you grew to like my sister, with no ulterior motive.</font>

586
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,044
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to believe that?</font>

587
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:10,784
<font color="yellow">I can't force you to believe me, but it's true.</font>

588
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:13,784
<font color="yellow">Don't give me that rubbish.</font>

589
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:16,744
<font color="yellow">You're trying to use Hyo Won...</font>

590
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:20,244
<font color="yellow">to get revenge at me and Ji Yun!</font>

591
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:21,844
<font color="yellow">Are you that closed-minded?</font>

592
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:24,114
<font color="yellow">How many times did I tell you that wasn't it?</font>

593
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:26,184
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

594
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:28,384
<font color="yellow">If you're after money,</font>

595
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:30,813
<font color="yellow">take this and get lost.</font>

596
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,813
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of seeing you like this.</font>

597
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,014
<font color="yellow">- Are you laughing? - In movies and on TV,</font>

598
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:41,153
<font color="yellow">this usually comes from the girl's mother.</font>

599
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:44,244
<font color="yellow">- The situation is amusing. - What is this punk babbling about?</font>

600
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:48,653
<font color="yellow">Look here, Hyo Sang.</font>

601
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:51,514
<font color="yellow">"Look here, Hyo Sang."</font>

602
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:54,284
<font color="yellow">You must have lost your darn mind.</font>

603
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,443
<font color="yellow">I am no longer an employee of this company,</font>

604
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:57,844
<font color="yellow">so that's who I'll address you.</font>

605
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:00,514
<font color="yellow">Just as your love is important,</font>

606
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:02,784
<font color="yellow">my love is precious to me,</font>

607
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,684
<font color="yellow">and I will risk my life to protect it if necessary.</font>

608
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:09,114
<font color="yellow">Don't think you can buy love with a few dollars.</font>

609
00:35:09,713 --> 00:35:10,713
<font color="yellow">Love...</font>

610
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:14,043
<font color="yellow">is precious and priceless.</font>

611
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,284
<font color="yellow">How dare you lecture me?</font>

612
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,153
<font color="yellow">Because you're the brother of my love.</font>

613
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,514
<font color="yellow">I'll ignore what happened today.</font>

614
00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:24,443
<font color="yellow">Try being a quarter of the person Hyo Won is.</font>

615
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:26,943
<font color="yellow">Hey, punk. Where are you doing?</font>

616
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:29,653

<font color="yellow">It's nothing serious.</font>

628
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,813

629
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,514
<font color="yellow">but I guess it hurt his pride. He refused to take it.</font>

734
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:10,643

735
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:12,744
<font color="yellow">Well, but...</font>

736
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,884
<font color="yellow">I just washed my hair,</font>

737
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:17,884

<font color="yellow">Yes. You're right.</font>

749
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:05,313
<font color="yellow">I like it that you're admitting it.</font>

750
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:09,543
<font color="yellow">You're out of breath. Have some water.</font>

751
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:19,184
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Is something wrong?</font>

752
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,213
<font color="yellow">No. Nothing's wrong.</font>

753
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:23,213
<font color="yellow">But hey,</font>

754
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:26,643
<font color="yellow">do you eat instant noodles all the time instead of rice?</font>

755
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:28,844
<font color="yellow">When did you finish all of that?</font>

756
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:30,713
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know.</font>

757
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:33,784
<font color="yellow">You can eat this today, but no more instant noodles for a while.</font>

758
00:45:33,784 --> 00:45:34,844
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

759
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:35,884
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

760
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,384
<font color="yellow">I'm worried now.</font>

761
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:41,414
<font color="yellow">Will you only make me instant noodles after we get married?</font>

762
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:53,844
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat first.</font>

763
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:09,313
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

764
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:19,583
<font color="yellow">I'm just thankful because you are so kind to me.</font>

765
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:21,614
<font color="yellow">You're so attentive to me.</font>

766
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:25,483
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be moved with such a little thing.</font>

767
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:28,514
<font color="yellow">You'll be all tears if I treat you better.</font>

768
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:30,244
<font color="yellow">Have some water.</font>

769
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:45,713
<font color="yellow">Go inside now. It's cold.</font>

770
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:47,744
<font color="yellow">You should leave first.</font>

771
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,083
<font color="yellow">I'll go inside after you leave.</font>

772
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:50,143
<font color="yellow">You go inside first.</font>

773
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:52,244
<font color="yellow">I feel relieved...</font>

774
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:55,114
<font color="yellow">when I see you go in safely and turn on the light.</font>

775
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:57,784
<font color="yellow">The light is on.</font>

776
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:02,414
<font color="yellow">I was in a hurry getting out...</font>

777
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:04,213
<font color="yellow">so I forgot to turn the light off.</font>

778
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:06,684
<font color="yellow">You did miss me.</font>

779
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:08,784
<font color="yellow">You hurried so much not to turn the light off.</font>

780
00:47:09,844 --> 00:47:10,983
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

781
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:13,284
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to the entrance.</font>

782
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:16,143
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

783
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,614
<font color="yellow">I can go myself. You should go.</font>

784
00:47:18,614 --> 00:47:21,043
<font color="yellow">I came all the way so far. I'd be sorry if I should leave now.</font>

785
00:47:21,043 --> 00:47:22,083
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

786
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,813
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. It's so close.</font>

787
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:26,744
<font color="yellow">You should go home now.</font>

788
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:29,884
<font color="yellow">You were making that proposal all day.</font>

789
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,643
<font color="yellow">You go first. I'll leave after you get home.</font>

790
00:47:32,844 --> 00:47:34,784
<font color="yellow">All right. Bye.</font>

791
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,643
<font color="yellow">I was going to sleep just a moment.</font>

792
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,483
<font color="yellow">Where is Sam Do?</font>

793
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:55,143
<font color="yellow">Has he gone to the restroom? Honey!</font>

794
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,744
<font color="yellow">Sam Do!</font>

795
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:01,983
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

796
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,844
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? You were sleeping.</font>

797
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:07,143
<font color="yellow">You were sleeping, too. Where have you been?</font>

798
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:08,614
<font color="yellow">Me? Well...</font>

799
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:10,684
<font color="yellow">I've been to the tailor shop.</font>

800
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:12,813
<font color="yellow">You've been to the tailor shop at this hour?</font>

801
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:16,143
<font color="yellow">Well, I had work to finish.</font>

802
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:19,643
<font color="yellow">- Is that true? - It is. I have no place else to go.</font>

803
00:49:21,414 --> 00:49:22,684
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here in this cold weather?</font>

804
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:24,313
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin,</font>

805
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:26,784
<font color="yellow">are you coming from the tailor shop with Sam Do?</font>

806
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:27,844
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

807
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,583
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

808
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,884
<font color="yellow">Then why are you coming separately?</font>

809
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:34,384
<font color="yellow">I had to get an urgent phone call.</font>

810
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:35,914
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What happened?</font>

811
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,284
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

812
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:39,643
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? It's cold. Let's go in.</font>

813
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:41,213
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

814
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,784
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much. You saved my life tonight.</font>

815
00:49:45,884 --> 00:49:48,514
<font color="yellow">Where have you been without telling your wife?</font>

816
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:50,713
<font color="yellow">I'll explain later.</font>

817
00:50:00,884 --> 00:50:01,983
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

818
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:04,514
<font color="yellow">How did she get in here?</font>

819
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:12,284
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

820
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:15,443
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, wake up.</font>

821
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,083
<font color="yellow">You should hold yourself together.</font>

822
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:34,943
<font color="yellow">What happened? Why did you come here?</font>

823
00:50:37,943 --> 00:50:39,884
<font color="yellow">I was afraid...</font>

824
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:41,813
<font color="yellow">you might be upset because of Mum.</font>

825
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:45,744
<font color="yellow">You said you have to be home by 9:00pm.</font>

826
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,684
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if ma'am finds out?</font>

827
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:50,083
<font color="yellow">I checked her falling asleep and got out.</font>

828
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:55,414
<font color="yellow">You must be upset a lot because of Mum.</font>

829
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,543
<font color="yellow">She didn't say anything wrong.</font>

830
00:50:58,813 --> 00:51:00,114
<font color="yellow">Aren't you worried, Hyo Won?</font>

831
00:51:00,884 --> 00:51:03,643
<font color="yellow">- What do I worry? - What if...</font>

832
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,713
<font color="yellow">I don't ever get a decent job and make a living with part time jobs?</font>

833
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:08,583
<font color="yellow">Aren't you worried about that?</font>

834
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:10,514
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

835
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:14,614
<font color="yellow">trust you.</font>

836
00:51:16,313 --> 00:51:19,284
<font color="yellow">In such difficult circumstances,</font>

837
00:51:19,483 --> 00:51:20,784
<font color="yellow">you didn't give up...</font>

838
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:23,884
<font color="yellow">and grew up to this well-mannered...</font>

839
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,684
<font color="yellow">and nice person.</font>

840
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,414
<font color="yellow">You can do anything if you have such capabilities.</font>

841
00:51:30,414 --> 00:51:31,884
<font color="yellow">I'll be by your side.</font>

842
00:51:34,614 --> 00:51:37,813
<font color="yellow">I'm really encouraged to hear you say so.</font>

843
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,213
<font color="yellow">Get up now.</font>

844
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:42,643
<font color="yellow">You should go home.</font>

845
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,114
<font color="yellow">Can't I stay here tonight?</font>

846
00:51:49,114 --> 00:51:50,643
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go home.</font>

847
00:51:57,844 --> 00:51:59,244
<font color="yellow">You're not allowed to sleep out.</font>

848
00:51:59,443 --> 00:52:03,014
<font color="yellow">My friends' boyfriends always ask them to go on a overnight trip.</font>

849
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:06,483
<font color="yellow">You're a strange man, Tae Yang.</font>

850
00:52:07,014 --> 00:52:08,083
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid...</font>

851
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:11,083
<font color="yellow">you don't love me.</font>

852
00:52:11,384 --> 00:52:13,014
<font color="yellow">If you love someone,</font>

853
00:52:13,443 --> 00:52:15,213
<font color="yellow">you should try,</font>

854
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:18,384
<font color="yellow">so that you keep it precious...</font>

855
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:21,043
<font color="yellow">and people around you wish you luck.</font>

856
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:25,943
<font color="yellow">Because you are the dearest and most precious person to me,</font>

857
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,744
<font color="yellow">I want to cherish and protect you.</font>

858
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:32,514
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

859
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:44,643
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

860
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,443
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here in this cold weather?</font>

861
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:52,244
<font color="yellow">I'm organising my thoughts...</font>

862
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:53,744
<font color="yellow">before I make an important announcement.</font>

863
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:55,083
<font color="yellow">An important announcement?</font>

864
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:57,713
<font color="yellow">Please stay by my side when I say that.</font>

865
00:52:57,713 --> 00:53:00,684
<font color="yellow">Grandma always agrees to what you say, okay?</font>

866
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,014
<font color="yellow">An important announcement?</font>

867
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:07,514
<font color="yellow">What do you want to say...</font>

868
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,943
<font color="yellow">to your grandparents at this hour?</font>

869
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:11,284
<font color="yellow">I wonder.</font>

870
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:14,114
<font color="yellow">What is your important announcement?</font>

871
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:15,443
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Grandpa,</font>

872
00:53:16,713 --> 00:53:20,083
<font color="yellow">please allow Mum and Sung Joon get married.</font>

873
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:24,313
<font color="yellow">I've never seen Mum happy as she is these days.</font>

874
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:26,514
<font color="yellow">I'd also be happy...</font>

875
00:53:27,014 --> 00:53:29,784
<font color="yellow">if a man like Sung Joon is Dad.</font>

876
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,943
<font color="yellow">Did Dong Sook asked you to say so?</font>

877
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:33,284
<font color="yellow">It's not like that at all.</font>

878
00:53:33,284 --> 00:53:35,614
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you this from my heart.</font>

879
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,483
<font color="yellow">I guess Da Jeong has been thinking about this enough, Mum.</font>

880
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,384
<font color="yellow">I've been closely watching him.</font>

881
00:53:41,414 --> 00:53:44,684
<font color="yellow">He seems to be an innocent and responsible person.</font>

882
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:46,784
<font color="yellow">What do you like...</font>

883
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:49,614
<font color="yellow">about Sung Joon, Da Jeong?</font>

884
00:53:49,744 --> 00:53:51,014
<font color="yellow">It seems that...</font>

885
00:53:51,643 --> 00:53:52,914
<font color="yellow">he sincerely...</font>

886
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,713
<font color="yellow">considers me as his family member,</font>

887
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,143
<font color="yellow">like his own daughter.</font>

888
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:10,943
<font color="yellow">Why don't we...</font>

889
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:13,614
<font color="yellow">go to a church or a cathedral...</font>

890
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:15,313
<font color="yellow">and get married now?</font>

891
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:19,213
<font color="yellow">Then Mum would give up objecting.</font>

892
00:54:21,543 --> 00:54:23,713
<font color="yellow">That's not a good thing to do, Dong Sook.</font>

893
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,614
<font color="yellow">That would just prove that...</font>

894
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:29,313
<font color="yellow">I, Sung Tae Pyung, is...</font>

895
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:31,784
<font color="yellow">a small-time busker.</font>

896
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:34,614
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

897
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:37,713
<font color="yellow">I said that since I was so upset.</font>

898
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:40,884
<font color="yellow">I'll be brave as usual.</font>

899
00:54:42,514 --> 00:54:45,313
<font color="yellow">Father, Mother, we're home!</font>

900
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:49,844
<font color="yellow">It must be Sung Joon.</font>

901
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,943
<font color="yellow">Father, Mother, we're back from work.</font>

902
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:54,784
<font color="yellow">- Good night. - Come in here.</font>

903
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,384
<font color="yellow">Why are you all here?</font>

904
00:55:04,443 --> 00:55:05,483
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

905
00:55:05,884 --> 00:55:08,443
<font color="yellow">You are so childish.</font>

906
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,514
<font color="yellow">You should thank Da Jeong.</font>

907
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:15,083
<font color="yellow">- For what? - Da Jeong asked parents...</font>

908
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:17,744
<font color="yellow">to allow you get married.</font>

909
00:55:21,713 --> 00:55:23,143
<font color="yellow">- Da Jeong. - Da Jeong.</font>

910
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:25,983
<font color="yellow">Your mum decided to change her mind...</font>

911
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:27,813
<font color="yellow">since she couldn't resist her granddaughter's appeal.</font>

912
00:55:29,844 --> 00:55:31,514
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Mother.</font>

913
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:33,244
<font color="yellow">This should be your last marriage.</font>

914
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:35,443
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

915
00:55:35,744 --> 00:55:38,213
<font color="yellow">Sung Joon is my life-long mate.</font>

916
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,583
<font color="yellow">It's my third time to hear that.</font>

917
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:41,744
<font color="yellow">Stop that.</font>

918
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,184
<font color="yellow">I'll make a deep bow to Father and Mother as a son-in-law to be.</font>

919
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,213
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

920
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:53,844
<font color="yellow">I'll make a deep bow, too.</font>

921

<font color="yellow">Is the tank empty?</font>

941
00:57:22,983 --> 00:57:25,384

<font color="yellow">Who is there to see us? Come on.</font>

946

<font color="yellow">That's 30 percent.</font>

947
00:57:57,914 --> 00:57:59,414

948
00:57:59,414 --> 00:58:01,313

949
00:58:03,043 --> 00:58:04,083
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

950
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:19,543
<font color="yellow">That's 100 percent.</font>

951

957
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:58,213

965

<font color="yellow">I can't go home.</font>

967
00:59:27,713 --> 00:59:30,114

968
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:42,684
<font color="yellow">Hello, it's been a while.</font>

969
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:45,943
<font color="yellow">Sorry to call you so late. I have to tell you something.</font>

970

971
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:51,014
<font color="yellow">Do you know where Yun Shil is?</font>

972
00:59:51,014 --> 00:59:53,884
<font color="yellow">She should be at home. I dropped her off a while ago.</font>

973
00:59:53,943 --> 00:59:56,744
<font color="yellow">She told me not to tell you in case you got worried,</font>

974
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,543
<font color="yellow">but I thought you should know.</font>

975
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:03,943
<font color="yellow">She's at the sauna on the main crossroads.</font>

976
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:06,943
<font color="yellow">What is she doing at a sauna?</font>

977
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:10,443
<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo's mother came over with a bag full of clothes.</font>

978

980
01:00:28,213 --> 01:00:29,813

983
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:41,583
<font color="yellow">I'm outside your place. Can you come downstairs?</font>

984
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:46,583
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

985
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:50,184

988
01:00:56,684 --> 01:00:59,483
<font color="yellow">Do you mind leaving it by the door?</font>

989
01:00:59,483 --> 01:01:02,643
<font color="yellow">The kimchi will freeze. It's cold, so don't make me wait.</font>

990

<font color="yellow">You don't live here.</font>

993
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,414
<font color="yellow">How did you know that I was here?</font>

994
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:31,684
<font color="yellow">Why does it matter how I found out?</font>

995
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:35,514
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you have called me when something like that happened?</font>

996
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,684
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I didn't want you to worry.</font>

997

1015
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:45,983
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

1016
01:02:45,983 --> 01:02:48,813
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can sleep knowing that...</font>
