00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,150
<font color="yellow">- What? - Don't you pretend... in front of me.</font>

148
00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:00,020
<font color="yellow">In fact, I was anxious that you might not come back because of that. I was really worried.</font>

149
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,640
<font color="yellow">That... What?</font>

150
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,930
<font color="yellow">What you mean what? Your and my 6 billion won! <i>(6M USD)</i></font>

151
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,580
<font color="yellow">- What is he talking about? I'm tired.
- Hey, the bracelet!</font>

152
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:16,190
<font color="yellow">Jadite bracelet, the one with the texture, hardness, transparency, and color that all seemed so real.</font>

153
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="yellow">How...did you know that, Hyung?</font>

154
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,390
<font color="yellow">- How do you think I know? It's probably because you said so.
- I did?</font>

155
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,530
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, you.
- You said you swindled it off of some girl that you met in Spain.</font>

156
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,200
<font color="yellow">A girl? What girl?</font>

157
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,590
<font color="yellow">Yeah, right. Others would believe you. They would all probably get deceived. But am I one to be hoodwinked?</font>

158
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,190
<font color="yellow">Let's not be like this, Joon Jae.</font>

159
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,350
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? What girl did I meet in Spain?</font>

160
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,790
<font color="yellow">You said you met some dumb, and not too bright, and weird girl!</font>

161
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,920
<font color="yellow">Take a look! The text you sent me! Picture of the bracelet! You sent them to me!</font>

162
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,870
<font color="yellow">Ah, I'm going crazy!</font>

163
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,840
<font color="yellow">Ah! Hey, I'm going even crazier!</font>

164
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,350
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you come back from Hollywood, instead of Spain? Your acting skill advanced so quickly!</font>

165
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,460
<font color="yellow">- No, that's really not it.
- What is not it?</font>

166
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,070
<font color="yellow">I've never sent such texts. And I've never even met weird girl.</font>

167
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,340
<font color="yellow">So, you don't have a bracelet, either?</font>

168
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,120
<font color="yellow">I do! I have that.</font>

169
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,000
<font color="yellow">See?! You do have the bracelet!</font>

170
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,740
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's not like you couldn't recognize that it's an extraordinary object!</font>

171
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,150
<font color="yellow">Where did you get it? You can't remember it, either?</font>

172
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,120
<font color="yellow">Ah! I don't know.</font>

173
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Jae. I am like this.</font>

174
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,120
<font color="yellow">I not only know what you are talking about, but I don't even want to know.</font>

175
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,880
<font color="yellow">Let's just see the object first. We need to get it appraised anyway.</font>

176
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,480
<font color="yellow">- We'll see.
- See? See what? Why do you want to see?</font>

177
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,780
<font color="yellow">The situation doesn't really line up. I just feel uneasy the way it is. Let me look into it first.</font>

178
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,860
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay! I will gladly take that uneasiness from you.</font>

179
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,890
<font color="yellow">You just hand over that bracelet to me, and you take that burden off of you! Huh?! Joon Jae!</font>

180
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,470
<font color="yellow"><i>Will you be going to Seoul soon?</i></font>

181
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,860
<font color="yellow"><i>Right. That's my home.</i></font>

182
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,070

184
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,290

185
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:09,860
<font color="yellow"><i>In Seoul, there are so many things that you'd like. For example, really yummy specialty restaurants.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Wow, that's incredibly beautiful.</i></font>

190
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,380
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll let you watch it with me.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, together with me.</i></font>

193
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,970
<font color="yellow"><i>You promised! A promise is meant to be kept.</i></font>

194
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,220
<font color="yellow"><i>Is there there a promise?</i></font>

195
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,790
<font color="yellow"><i>It's there to be kept.</i></font>

196
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,990

199
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,550
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,250

-Watch what you say, please!</font>

<font color="yellow">Once we arrive, you go to the rooftop and immediately start working on the elevator.</font>

289
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,820
<font color="yellow">Hyung keep checking to make sure her plans haven't changed.</font>

290
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,630
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

291
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,280
<font color="yellow">As expected, you have to take a break from work sometime.</font>

292
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,310
<font color="yellow">I excited now that we're back at it!</font>

293
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,690
<font color="yellow">Excited, my butt.</font>

294
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,910
<font color="yellow">Just think about packing up your bags and leaving after this!</font>

295
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,560
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you know Heo Joon Jae?</font>

296
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,930
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you know Heo Joon Jae?</font>

297
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,550
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, do you know Heo Joon Jae? Heo Joon Jae?</font>

298
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,130
<font color="yellow">The person we scammed,</font>

299
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,020
<font color="yellow">who knew we would run into them at the golf course?</font>

300
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,130
<font color="yellow">But I learned for the first time...that I'm faster than Usain Bolt!</font>

301
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,930
<font color="yellow">You think Seoul is big, right? It's the size of your palm.</font>

302
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,290
<font color="yellow">As you live, you're meant to run into them at least once.</font>

303
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,470
<font color="yellow">We just don't know that.</font>

304
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,490
<font color="yellow">- Aish.
- What the heck?</font>

305
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,290
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

306
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,860
<font color="yellow"><i>A bottle of soju for $1</i></font>

307
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,490
<font color="yellow">Please come by.</font>

308
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,770
<font color="yellow">-That car didn't come yet?
-Nope.</font>

309
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,170
<font color="yellow">Not until 3.</font>

310
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,020
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

311
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,160
<font color="yellow">That'll be 1,000 won.</font>

312
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,110
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving me this? You have to give me money. Money!</font>

313
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,960
<font color="yellow">If you don't have money, go away. Quickly go away!</font>

314
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,300
<font color="yellow">Smile, smile. Look ahead. You have to look ahead and walk across.</font>

315
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,820
<font color="yellow">We have to look close. Okay?</font>

316
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,970
<font color="yellow">I need to buy a reference book, but I don't have enough money.</font>

317
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,700
<font color="yellow">-Academy fee for me.
-Quickly.</font>

318
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,590
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

319
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,170
<font color="yellow">Thanks. See ya.</font>

320
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,310
<font color="yellow">It's okay, it's okay. Smile, smile.</font>

321
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,670
<font color="yellow">Look ahead. Walk while looking ahead.</font>

322
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,070
<font color="yellow">Unni, why are you doing this?</font>

323
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,560
<font color="yellow">Do you have money? I'm really hungry.</font>

324
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,650
<font color="yellow">You don't have money?</font>

325
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,880
<font color="yellow">Even so, you mug a little kid's money?</font>

326
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,360
<font color="yellow">What's mugging?</font>

327
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,930
<font color="yellow">This is mugging.</font>

328
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,440
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you using mom's credit card, since you said you were hungry, unnie.
(kiddo used an abbreviation for mom's credit card)</font>

329
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,910
<font color="yellow">What's a "mom-ca"?</font>

330
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,010
<font color="yellow">Unnie, how come you don't know anything?</font>

331
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,600
<font color="yellow">Mom's credit card. Mom-ca.</font>

332
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,980
<font color="yellow">Is "mom's credit card" better than money?</font>

333
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,530
<font color="yellow">It's a similar concept. Anyway, don't do that again.</font>

334
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,310
<font color="yellow">Ok. I won't.</font>

335
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,160
<font color="yellow">Money is something that's earned with great difficulty. My mom has such a hard time earning money.</font>

336
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,560
<font color="yellow">Without even having time to see me,</font>

337
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,940
<font color="yellow">from morning to dusk she only earns money.</font>

338
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,730
<font color="yellow">But why does your mom work so hard to earn money?</font>

339
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,090
<font color="yellow">Unni seriously you're helpless. Why do you think we earn money.</font>

340
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,950
<font color="yellow">She earns money so that mom and I can be happy.</font>

341
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:25,220
<font color="yellow">But if all you do is earn money from morning to dusk, then when do we live happily?</font>

342
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,420
<font color="yellow">Later. Later, please.</font>

343
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,050
<font color="yellow">Oh I need to go to math academy now.</font>

344
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,990
<font color="yellow">Be sure to find that person, Heo Joon Jae, that you're looking for, Unnie.</font>

345
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,690
<font color="yellow">Keep this well, don't give it to others, and use it well.</font>

346
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,220
<font color="yellow">From now on, at least work a part-time job to earn money.</font>

347
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,630
<font color="yellow">Since living for awhile, I came to know that living without money</font>

348
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,490
<font color="yellow">isn't a big deal at all.</font>

349
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,570
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

350
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,470
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be going. Goodbye.</font>

351
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,790
<font color="yellow">Aigoo.</font>

352
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,270
<font color="yellow">Ajusshi watch yourself.</font>

353
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,450
<font color="yellow">Hey kiddo. It's you who needs to be careful.</font>

354
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,370
<font color="yellow">Hey, such a little thing. Hey! How can I be an ajusshi?</font>

355
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:58,360
<font color="yellow">. You! You! come over here!
- Hey, hey, hey you're an ajusshi to her. How could you be an oppa. Let's go. It's almost time.</font>

356
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,930
<font color="yellow">Come here, Tae Oh. Hurry on over Tae Oh.</font>

357
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,400
<font color="yellow">Look friend, do you have money?</font>

358
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,830
<font color="yellow">Your unnie here, needs to buy a supplementary textbook, but I don't have enough money.</font>

359
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:18,130
<font color="yellow">Look here. Don't mug her. It's a bad thing.</font>

360
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,300
<font color="yellow">What's up with her?</font>

361
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,360
<font color="yellow">You guys don't have a 'mom's credit card'? It's similar to money.</font>

362
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,990
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

363
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,070
<font color="yellow">How dare you, with clothes that look like a beggar!</font>

364
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,460
<font color="yellow">Promise me. That you won't mug others.</font>

365
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,890
<font color="yellow">I didn't...I didn't mug her. I...I...I'm friends with her (<i>to be friends sounds like eat</i>)</font>

366
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,840
<font color="yellow">Your friends...?</font>

367
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,060
<font color="yellow">You eat them?</font>

368
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,420
<font color="yellow">Guys! You shouldn't eat your friends like that!</font>

369
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,120
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do that!</font>

370
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,710
<font color="yellow">Do you also eat your friends?</font>

371
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,920
<font color="yellow">Don't eat it really. Eat something else!</font>

372
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,990
<font color="yellow">- Are you ok? You got hurt. Isn't she totally psycho!
- Please. Don't.</font>

373
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,300
<font color="yellow">Yeah, mom. I'm at the cram school.</font>

374
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,160
<font color="yellow">You're at the cram school right? I'm going to call and check later.</font>

375
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,770
<font color="yellow">Don't hang around bad kids needlessly. Look at your brother.</font>

376
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,090
<font color="yellow">That good-hearted kid being framed, he must be suffering so much.</font>

377
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,920
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal about a crazy kid committing suicide. Hang up.</font>

378
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,130
<font color="yellow"><i>The Best Deal of Ever!</i>
What the..</font>

379
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,190
<font color="yellow">So useless.</font>

380
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,860
<font color="yellow">It's stopping.</font>

381
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,030
<font color="yellow">Geez. What's going on.</font>

382
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:46,690
<font color="yellow">What the heck. Who are you! You're definitely that jerk that conned me!</font>

383
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,160
<font color="yellow">I definitely heard you were dead.</font>

384
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,760
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Looks like I'm quite invincible.</font>

385
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,620
<font color="yellow">How dare you come here on your own-- Omo.</font>

386
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,800
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

387
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,700
<font color="yellow">It's so dark. Shall I give you some light?</font>

388
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,330
<font color="yellow">The elevator doors opened. you know. Behind you.</font>

389
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,920
<font color="yellow">But outside's a bottomless ledge.</font>

390
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,230
<font color="yellow">No, what's going on?</font>

391
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, be careful with where you step. You might step on it. There's someone's hand there.</font>

392
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,200
<font color="yellow">Isn't that your son?</font>

393
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,360
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom! Help me!</font>

394
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,130
<font color="yellow">- Min Jae,
- Mom!</font>

395
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,610
<font color="yellow">Min Jae. Hold my hand.</font>

396
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,660
<font color="yellow">- Help me mom.
- Min Jae! Min Jae!</font>

397
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,830
<font color="yellow">No, you can't. You have to hold my hand and come up again.</font>

398
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,700
<font color="yellow">- No, no. Min Jae no!
- Mom!!!!!!!</font>

399
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,970
<font color="yellow">Remember your pain now.</font>

400
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,070
<font color="yellow">The child that your son made die.</font>

401
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,700
<font color="yellow">The child who fell to his death on the top floor, the 17th floor.</font>

402
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,820
<font color="yellow">That child's mother</font>

403
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,770
<font color="yellow">was as miserable as you are now, and</font>

404
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,930
<font color="yellow">forever they will be in agony.</font>

405
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,430
<font color="yellow">Now, from now on those who have wronged you,</font>

406
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,530
<font color="yellow">you will forget them all.</font>

407
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,540
<font color="yellow">To those who are suffering because of you,</font>

408
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,800
<font color="yellow">only remember your sorry heart.</font>

409
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,540
<font color="yellow">Madam are you ok? The elevator broke all of a sudden.</font>

410
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,410
<font color="yellow">Contact Attorney Seo, and ask him to cancel the lawsuit.</font>

411
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,610
<font color="yellow">pardon?</font>

412
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:22,470
<font color="yellow">Also, you know the contact information of the mom whose kid died right?</font>

413
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,930
<font color="yellow">Let me meet her.</font>

414
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,050
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do when you meet him.</font>

415
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,040
<font color="yellow">I'm going to apologize.</font>

416
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,340
<font color="yellow">Madam, are you feeling unwell?</font>

417
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,120
<font color="yellow">Is he crazy? He's absolutely psychotic.</font>

418
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,540
<font color="yellow">Hey look here, the heresy of neuroscience.</font>

419
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:53,270
<font color="yellow">DIY-ace hypnotist of the medical field. Heo Joon Jae's talent hasn't rusted even a little bit.</font>

420
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,020
<font color="yellow">This is really something, right?</font>

421
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,140
<font color="yellow">Since we're in an occupation that we can't exactly be proud of,</font>

422
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,450
<font color="yellow">I'm so regretful that I can't let this talent of yours be known to the world. Really.</font>

423
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,090
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- Wait.</font>

424
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,770
<font color="yellow">How can you do it? Hypnosis?</font>

425
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:16,380
<font color="yellow">Hey! Pray tell. He must be so curious that he opened that iron-clad lips of his.</font>

426
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,150
<font color="yellow">Are you curious?</font>

427
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,230
<font color="yellow">This is how you begin. With the sense of sight.</font>

428
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,850
<font color="yellow">The grain and eyes are connected.</font>

429
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:31,180
<font color="yellow">The moment the number 17 on the implicitly ladden spam text is seen</font>

430
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,060
<font color="yellow">Thus a condition is presented where hypnosis can take place.</font>

431
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,030
<font color="yellow">Next, the a pattern interrupt.
(Creating a situation that's hard to anticipate, and hypnotizing a person using the lapse in conscious.)</font>

00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,950
<font color="yellow">Shall I turn on the light?
That person now enters the fantasy world that I made.</font>

433
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,980
<font color="yellow">But externally, it's like a bottomless pit.</font>

434
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,360
<font color="yellow">mom!</font>

435
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,470
<font color="yellow">Everything starts with the eyes.</font>

436
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,030
<font color="yellow">Looking, starts the seduction.</font>

437
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,240
<font color="yellow">Such a coward. Not everyone falls for that.</font>

438
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,850
<font color="yellow">What a fashion interrupt?</font>

439
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,410
<font color="yellow">Can I really get this?</font>

440
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,060
<font color="yellow">You usually can't, but I'll keep an eye out, so hurry up and pick something.</font>

441
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,200
<font color="yellow">This neighborhood is a rich one, so they'll throw away new things.</font>

442
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,560
<font color="yellow">Others are at the Seoul Station after hearing that free lunches were being given out there,</font>

443
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,820
<font color="yellow">but I can't leave Gangnam. If you starve, you're starved,</font>

444
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,940
<font color="yellow">but I can't give up on fashion.</font>

445
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,800
<font color="yellow">But seeing you all dressed up like that, it's a bit more bearable now.</font>

446
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,160
<font color="yellow">Well for us tall girls, we look good in things we wear.</font>

447
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,480
<font color="yellow">Where did you come from?</font>

448
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,760
<font color="yellow">Across the pond.
(She used the word water but the homeless person understands it to be "overseas")</font>

449
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,840
<font color="yellow">Oh! overseas! I know that place very well!</font>

450
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:09,010
<font color="yellow">In my youth, there weren't places like Milan and Paris that I didn't go to to buy luxury goods.</font>

451
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,150
<font color="yellow">Then I got bankrupt and even though I'm ruining myself</font>

452
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,400
<font color="yellow">and living the street life right now,</font>

453
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,020
<font color="yellow">I don't have any regrets.</font>

454
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,160
<font color="yellow">But why did you come to Seoul?</font>

455
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,020
<font color="yellow">I'm searching for Heo Joon Jae.</font>

456
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,190
<font color="yellow">Boyfriend? Where does he live in Seoul? Daechi-dong? Cheogdam(-dong)?</font>

457
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,350
<font color="yellow">He just said he lives in Seoul.</font>

458
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,170
<font color="yellow">What about is phone number?</font>

459
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,670
<font color="yellow">Phone number?</font>

460
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,580
<font color="yellow">Aigoo, he didn't give you a contact number and ran off.</font>

461
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,660
<font color="yellow">But you didn't realize that and came all the way here?</font>

462
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,940
<font color="yellow">Aigoo. That's when you need to go do undercover investigation.</font>

463
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,510
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

464
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,260
<font color="yellow">He never talked about a specific place with you before?</font>

465
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,710
<font color="yellow">Unconsciously, he's bound to drop hints all over places he frequents.</font>

466
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,690
<font color="yellow">You should go to places like that and camp there.</font>

467
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,630
<font color="yellow">63 Building?</font>

468
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,300
<font color="yellow"><i>63 Building</i></font>

469
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,620
<font color="yellow"><i>4319 from Isu Station to Yangjae
Dogok Station to Samsung Station</i></font>

470
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,700
<font color="yellow"><i> Gangnam Station ----> 63 Building</i></font>

471
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,320
<font color="yellow"><i>63 Building</i></font>

472
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,440
<font color="yellow">-Welcome.
-<i>Thank you.</i></font>

473
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,490
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

474
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,250
<font color="yellow">You don't have a bus card?</font>

475
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,880
<font color="yellow">What about money?</font>

476
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,630
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

477
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,650
<font color="yellow">That's not enough.</font>

478
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,600
<font color="yellow">Just put in that amount and get on.</font>

479
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,450
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

480
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,820
<font color="yellow">Your eyes, more than any other words</font>

481
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,530
<font color="yellow">are sparkling.</font>

482
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,340
<font color="yellow">I feel that.</font>

483
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,250
<font color="yellow">In my dream last night</font>

484
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:21,190
<font color="yellow">smiling wide, like the wind</font>

485
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:26,330
<font color="yellow">you did. The path you walked alone</font>

486
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,130
<font color="yellow">The dream I chased alone.</font>

487
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,910
<font color="yellow">Now, beside me</font>

488
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,530
<font color="yellow">you're here.</font>

489
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,840
<font color="yellow">For a long long time, will you be remembered</font>

490
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,380
<font color="yellow">maybe.</font>

491
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,970
<font color="yellow">Come a bit closer to me</font>

492
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,590
<font color="yellow">so that I can feel you better.</font>

493
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,310
<font color="yellow">My heart leans closer to you.</font>

494
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:05,900
<font color="yellow">bit, by bit. Bit by bit.</font>

495
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,290
<font color="yellow">Bit by bit.</font>

496
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,690
<font color="yellow">A night alone.</font>

497
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:15,630
<font color="yellow">If I go all the way up, will I see Heo Joon Jae?</font>

498
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,300
<font color="yellow">Be prepared tomorrow.</font>

499
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,070
<font color="yellow">A restructuring is a restructuring. Also the fireworks! The people'll come in droves!</font>

500
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,410
<font color="yellow">-You need to thoroughly be prepared.
-Okay.</font>

501
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,490
<font color="yellow">If you guys are late again even though I said this to you, then didori-didori.</font>

502
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,640
<font color="yellow">Ah, I'm relieved.</font>

503
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,550
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to die from hunger.</font>

504
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,980
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

505
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,890
<font color="yellow">Is it someone's birthday?</font>

506
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,690
<font color="yellow">There is.</font>

507
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,680
<font color="yellow">-Today is my son's birthday too.
-Yeah.</font>

508
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, what did you put in the seaweed soup?</font>

509
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,080
<font color="yellow">Sea urchin. My son too liked sea urchin seaweed soup.</font>

510
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,180
<font color="yellow">Who are you giving it to?</font>

511
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,770
<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

512
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,300
<font color="yellow">That chic guy that won't fall for you?</font>

513
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,360
<font color="yellow">Please put the soup into a thermos, and as for the rest of the side dishes, put them into a bento box prettily.</font>

514
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

515
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,560
<font color="yellow">Miss.</font>

516
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,610
<font color="yellow">You don't seduce men like that.</font>

517
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:25,360
<font color="yellow">In the time that you bring the side dishes to him, it's better to get one more shot of botox.</font>

518
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,500
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that you need to love yourself more.</font>

519
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:36,260
<font color="yellow">At a study group that I volunteer teach, there's a kid who had a birthday. So I'm trying to give it to him/her.</font>

520
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,640
<font color="yellow">Who would seduce a man with something to eat? How childish.</font>

521
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,810
<font color="yellow">I cooked it with sea urchins. I'm not sure if it'll fit with your taste preference.</font>

522
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,100
<font color="yellow">How did you know about this place? It hasn't been long since I moved here.</font>

523
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,040
<font color="yellow">It suddenly came up as I was talking with Oppa Nam Doo.</font>

524
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,570
<font color="yellow">Ah, really, Jo Nam Doo. That untrustworthy human being.</font>

525
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,780
<font color="yellow"><i>Happy birthday, son.</i></font>

526
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,630
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay.</i></font>

527
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom, we're going there today, right?</i></font>

528
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Of course.</i></font>

529
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,080
<font color="yellow"><i>Your Dad is busy again today, so we're just gonna go together, okay?</i></font>

530
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,140
<font color="yellow"><i>-Where are you going?
-It's a secret.</i></font>

531
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,940
<font color="yellow">Wow! Why the seaweed soup?</font>

532
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,080
<font color="yellow">Hey, Cha Si Ah, you did this?</font>

533
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,370
<font color="yellow">It's Joon Jae's birthday.</font>

534
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,800
<font color="yellow">My goodness, look at her. She doesn't look like it at first glance,</font>

535
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,500
<font color="yellow">but she's excellent good-wife-material, right?</font>

536
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,720
<font color="yellow">You made it so pretty, for real.</font>

537
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,660
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's your birthday today, so you need to do a party, a birthday party.</font>

538
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,360
<font color="yellow">There's a good wine bar that I know of in Gyeongridan-gil.</font>

539
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, Gyeongridan-gil is good! The water (pretty girls) is good! Reserve it, reserve it.</font>

540
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,090
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment.</font>

541
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,190
<font color="yellow">-What appointment?
-Ah, what is it?</font>

542
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,820
<font color="yellow">You always do this on your birthday. Being sentimental by yourself.</font>

543
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,150
<font color="yellow">-Where are you going? Who are you meeting with? He/she can just sit with us!
-Hyung.</font>

544
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,590
<font color="yellow">-Yeah?
-Are you bored?
-Yeah.</font>

545
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,810
<font color="yellow">-Very much so.
-Then go to the wine bar with Si Ah.</font>

546
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,400
<font color="yellow">Go there and party. Or go with Tae Oh.</font>

547
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,050
<font color="yellow">I ate well. Thanks.</font>

548
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,680
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday! Spend it well!</font>

549
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:38,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, he won't fall for it. Such a steel-headed guy.</font>

550
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,300
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae isn't going to meet up with a girl, right?</font>

551
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,190
<font color="yellow">-Did he get one (a girlfriend)?
-No.</font>

552
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,260
<font color="yellow">It's hard for him to have a girl, based on his brain-structure.</font>

553
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,710
<font color="yellow">He can't decide nor stay focused.</font>

554
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,650
<font color="yellow">He'll let any woman cross that line,</font>

555
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,580
<font color="yellow">but no woman will ever cross that line.</font>

556
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,410
<font color="yellow">But did you really make this?</font>

557
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,740
<font color="yellow">You think I would? The maid lady did it.</font>

558
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Jae, we should go together.</i></font>

559
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom, I'm going to play around until the door closes.</i></font>

560
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,620
<font color="yellow"><i>Be careful. I'll go with you. Joon Jae!</i></font>

561
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,340
<font color="yellow">- It's a mermaid!
- Oh look</font>

562
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,220
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

563
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:15,100
<font color="yellow">There's still 30 minutes left until the mermaid show. Did they start already?</font>

564
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,930
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Yes?</font>

565
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,340
<font color="yellow">The mermaid... slurped the fish up.</font>

566
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:25,660
<font color="yellow">Gee. There's no way. The Mermaid Princess is friends with the fish.</font>

567
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,980
<font color="yellow">She never eats them.</font>

568
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,240
<font color="yellow">Mermaid Princess! So pretty!</font>

569
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,750
<font color="yellow">The show didn't start yet. Did the diver go under already?</font>

570
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,430
<font color="yellow">Yes, it seems so.</font>

571
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,990
<font color="yellow">Look!</font>

572
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,600
<font color="yellow">Who was it? Who went inside?</font>

573
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,250
<font color="yellow">♬ <i>The door to a new world is open.</i> ♬</font>

574
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,750
<font color="yellow">♬ <i>It is within you.</i> ♬</font>

575
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:22,590
<font color="yellow">♬ <i> When I enter my eyes are dazzled</i> ♬</font>

576
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:32,010
