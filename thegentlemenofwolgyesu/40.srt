00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,329
<font color="yellow">She got pregnant...</font>

155
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,729
<font color="yellow">before she gets married.</font>

156
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,700
<font color="yellow">What a shame!</font>

157
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,670
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

158
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,070
<font color="yellow">They say a baby is the best wedding present nowadays.</font>

159
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,670
<font color="yellow">Stop talking!</font>

160
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

161
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,170
<font color="yellow">By the way, when did you get pregnant?</font>

162
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,369
<font color="yellow">Was it when you visited Kang Tae Yang's home?</font>

163
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,369
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

164
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,229
<font color="yellow">Well, that's right.</font>

165
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,800
<font color="yellow">I told you that I went all the way with him.</font>

166
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,629
<font color="yellow">They say every evil doer has his reasons.</font>

167
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,400
<font color="yellow">How can you talk back to me like that?</font>

168
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,930
<font color="yellow">You are such a trouble maker!</font>

169
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,099
<font color="yellow">I'm in my early pregnancy. Please be careful, Mum.</font>

170
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,430
<font color="yellow">My baby.</font>

171
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:01,770
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

172
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,170
<font color="yellow">I think I should get married soon.</font>

173
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,800
<font color="yellow">I can't stand it anymore.</font>

174
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,400
<font color="yellow">It's shameful if people can notice that I'm pregnant on the wedding.</font>

175
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

176
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,200
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll let Hyo Sang get married first...</font>

177
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:21,270
<font color="yellow">and then you can get married.</font>

178
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,200
<font color="yellow">What about I get married...</font>

179
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,700
<font color="yellow">before Hyo Sang gets married?</font>

180
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,969
<font color="yellow">I will be all right,</font>

181
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:32,170
<font color="yellow">but I'm worried that your pride might get hurt.</font>

182
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,170
<font color="yellow">If I get married as soon as possible,</font>

183
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,099
<font color="yellow">we can tell people that I got pregnant during my honeymoon.</font>

184
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,570
<font color="yellow">During your honeymoon?</font>

185
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,900
<font color="yellow">I'm still in my early pregnancy.</font>

186
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,999
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

187
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,570
<font color="yellow">Then, you should not tell anyone except me...</font>

188
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,400
<font color="yellow">that you're pregnant.</font>

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,700
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't tell that even to Kang Tae Yang.</font>

190
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,170
<font color="yellow">He's the dad of this baby. He should know.</font>

191
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,129
<font color="yellow">If he knows that you have his baby,</font>

192
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,700
<font color="yellow">he might act like he's the king.</font>

193
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,869
<font color="yellow">So, let's tell him later,</font>

194
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,869
<font color="yellow">after you finish your wedding.</font>

195
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,070
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

196
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,170
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - All right.</font>

197
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,270
<font color="yellow">You're a trouble maker.</font>

198
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,170
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

199
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,999
<font color="yellow">I'm totally fine.</font>

200
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:22,229
<font color="yellow">You didn't sound good in the afternoon, but you sound good now.</font>

201
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,770
<font color="yellow">I took a hot bath and cleared my head.</font>

202
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,030
<font color="yellow">I feel better now.</font>

203
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,430
<font color="yellow">That's good. I worried about you.</font>

204
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,700
<font color="yellow">By the way, Tae Yang,</font>

205
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:35,329
<font color="yellow">we should get married.</font>

206
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,969
<font color="yellow">What do you mean that we should get married?</font>

207
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,229
<font color="yellow">I suddenly...</font>

208
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,129
<font color="yellow">- want to get married. - Hyo Won.</font>

209
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,700
<font color="yellow">I'll get everything ready for the wedding.</font>

210
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,129
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is being beside me on the wedding, Tae Yang.</font>

211
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,999
<font color="yellow">It won't be difficult for you.</font>

212
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,770
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

213
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,530
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang, may I come in?</font>

214
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,400
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, I'll call you back later.</font>

215
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:01,170
<font color="yellow">Why does she want to get married?</font>

216
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,099
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Doesn't it look perfect?</font>

217
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,800
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to fry an egg without breaking the yolk.</font>

218
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,229
<font color="yellow">You must be good at cooking.</font>

219
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:32,869
<font color="yellow">If you want to eat a perfect fried egg like this,</font>

220
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,900
<font color="yellow">you can just say yes to my proposal.</font>

221
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,670
<font color="yellow">Then I will make it for you for free for the rest of your life.</font>

222
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:41,700
<font color="yellow">I've never imagined that he would come here to find me.</font>

223
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:45,300
<font color="yellow">I'm so thankful and sorry, Dong Jin.</font>

224
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,930
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

225
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,129
<font color="yellow">Can I come in?</font>

226
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:01,969
<font color="yellow">Yes, you can.</font>

227
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,229
<font color="yellow">Your mum's worried that you're sick.</font>

228
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,129
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - Yes.</font>

229
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,869
<font color="yellow">I took some aspirin. I feel better now.</font>

230
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:16,430
<font color="yellow">I see. Let's sit down.</font>

231
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,670
<font color="yellow">Earlier today...</font>

232
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,700
<font color="yellow">I met Yun Shil.</font>

233
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,530
<font color="yellow">Did you actually see her?</font>

234
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,329
<font color="yellow">I insisted that we meet up.</font>

235
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,099
<font color="yellow">I guess she couldn't refuse an old man's plea.</font>

236
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
<font color="yellow">Did she...</font>

237
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,300
<font color="yellow">look well?</font>

238
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,930
<font color="yellow">She looked somewhat thinner,</font>

239
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,900
<font color="yellow">but I think she's fine.</font>

240
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,329
<font color="yellow">Where exactly is she staying?</font>

241
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:44,700
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't say.</font>

242
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,770
<font color="yellow">She's working at a farm.</font>

243
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,629
<font color="yellow">A farm? Which one? Where?</font>

244
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,599
<font color="yellow">She didn't say, but I think she's fine.</font>

245
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:54,770
<font color="yellow">I told her...</font>

246
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,229
<font color="yellow">not to give up on her dream of making suits,</font>

247
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:01,329
<font color="yellow">regardless of her relationship with you.</font>

248
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,869
<font color="yellow">She said she'll call when she's ready, so let's give her time.</font>

249
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,430
<font color="yellow">Did she say if she's sick?</font>

250
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,499
<font color="yellow">I think she's hanging in there.</font>

251
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,530
<font color="yellow">Uncle. Grandpa.</font>

252
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,930
<font color="yellow">Let's watch TV.</font>

253
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,270
<font color="yellow">Dad's episode of "Music Stage" starts soon.</font>

254
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,629
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

255
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,129
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Sure.</font>

256
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,530
<font color="yellow">How's your headache?</font>

257
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,300
<font color="yellow">I feel much better now.</font>

258
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,329
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat dinner. Shall I boil you some rice?</font>

259
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,170
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not hungry.</font>

260
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,469
<font color="yellow">Tae Pyung.</font>

261
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:53,229
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations. - Thanks.</font>

262
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,729
<font color="yellow">I sang my heart out...</font>

263
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,170
<font color="yellow">but I'm not sure how it'll look.</font>

264
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,070
<font color="yellow">Don't even go there.</font>

265
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,969
<font color="yellow">He went to the toilet so often he almost missed his cue.</font>

266
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,469
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about that moment gives me the shivers.</font>

267
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,599
<font color="yellow">I have diarrhoea when I get too nervous.</font>

268
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,530
<font color="yellow">Dad, not while we're eating.</font>

269
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:14,229
<font color="yellow">Sorry about that.</font>

270
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,770
<font color="yellow">These are really sweet.</font>

271
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,129
<font color="yellow">- Your dad bought them today. - They're lovely.</font>

272
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:22,869
<font color="yellow">Are these from the shop at the crossroads?</font>

273
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:25,200
<font color="yellow">I met someone earlier today...</font>

274
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,499
<font color="yellow">and the person said these are fresh from the farm.</font>

275
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,469
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

276
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,869
<font color="yellow">is that lady...</font>

277
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:39,329
<font color="yellow">- really your wife? - Pardon?</font>

278
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:41,800
<font color="yellow">I was just asking.</font>

279
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,969
<font color="yellow">She looked so pretty in the photo.</font>

280
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,229
<font color="yellow">If you ever see the woman in the photo,</font>

281
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,599
<font color="yellow">please give me a call. Please.</font>

282
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,770
<font color="yellow">Sure, I will.</font>

283
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:56,670
<font color="yellow">The strawberry farm.</font>

284
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,930
<font color="yellow">She has to be there.</font>

285
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,329
<font color="yellow">Please be there, Yun Shil.</font>

286
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,670
<font color="yellow">I think this is it.</font>

287
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,229
<font color="yellow">Is anyone here?</font>

288
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,270
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil?</font>

289
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,369
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

290
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,569
<font color="yellow">How did you find me here?</font>

291
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,400
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't be able to?</font>

292
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,769
<font color="yellow">Try harder next time.</font>

293
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,499
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the end of the earth to find you.</font>

294
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:07,969
<font color="yellow">Is this where you're staying?</font>

295
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,569
<font color="yellow">It looks a mess but it isn't that bad.</font>

296
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,239
<font color="yellow">Come home with me.</font>

297
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:17,529
<font color="yellow">I can't go back.</font>

298
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,029
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

299
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,400
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

300
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,469
<font color="yellow">about my mum?</font>

301
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,630
<font color="yellow">- It's not. - I know that...</font>

302
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,769
<font color="yellow">- she said terrible things to you. - It's not about that.</font>

303
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,069
<font color="yellow">Everything she said makes sense...</font>

304
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,130
<font color="yellow">and she didn't say terrible things to me.</font>

305
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,700
<font color="yellow">Even if you understand where she's coming from,</font>

306
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,400
<font color="yellow">it would still hurt.</font>

307
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,130
<font color="yellow">You're right. It hurt and I'm in pain.</font>

308
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:47,600
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

309
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,700
<font color="yellow">not because of your mum.</font>

310
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:51,700
<font color="yellow">It's because of you.</font>

311
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,330
<font color="yellow">It took so much courage to leave the store.</font>

312
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,430
<font color="yellow">I'm practically forcing myself to stay here.</font>

313
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,370
<font color="yellow">Why did you come looking for me?</font>

314
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,130
<font color="yellow">If I give up and leave,</font>

315
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,999
<font color="yellow">no one else will get hurt.</font>

316
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,499
<font color="yellow">So leave me alone and go back home.</font>

317
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,330
<font color="yellow">What nonsense is that?</font>

318
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,900
<font color="yellow">Don't you see the pain that...</font>

319
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,600
<font color="yellow">you're causing me?</font>

320
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,029
<font color="yellow">The two of us...</font>

321
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,130
<font color="yellow">only met a few months ago.</font>

322
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,299
<font color="yellow">We fought for most of that time.</font>

323
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,299
<font color="yellow">So even if we break up,</font>

324
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,200
<font color="yellow">we'll get over it soon enough.</font>

325
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,170
<font color="yellow">Is that all you felt about me?</font>

326
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,430
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

327
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,239
<font color="yellow">I can't be happy without you.</font>

328
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,100
<font color="yellow">You did this to me and now you want to break up?</font>

329
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,630
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll say yes?</font>

330
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,239
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of it now.</font>

331
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,239
<font color="yellow">About you and your mum...</font>

332
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:59,130
<font color="yellow">and Gi Pyo and his mum.</font>

333
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:01,999
<font color="yellow">It's too much for me to handle.</font>

334
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,299
<font color="yellow">Why do you think...</font>

335
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,670
<font color="yellow">I decided to leave the store and come here?</font>

336
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,830
<font color="yellow">Just go home.</font>

337
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,100
<font color="yellow">I'll be unhappy without you.</font>

338
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,969
<font color="yellow">How can you talk about breaking up so easily?</font>

339
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,930
<font color="yellow">If we stay together we'll only make each other unhappy.</font>

340
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,430
<font color="yellow">It's cowardice to run away without trying.</font>

341
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,469
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

342
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,299
<font color="yellow">I'm a coward.</font>

343
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:27,630
<font color="yellow">To be with you...</font>

344
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,400
<font color="yellow">I have to fight everything that comes our way.</font>

345
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,630
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

346
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,870
<font color="yellow">I'd rather be a coward and run away.</font>

347
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,830
<font color="yellow">Do I...</font>

348
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:42,969
<font color="yellow">Do I make...</font>

349
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,269
<font color="yellow">your life that tough to live?</font>

350
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,069
<font color="yellow">This is the best for me.</font>

351
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,069
<font color="yellow">If you care for me,</font>

352
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,529
<font color="yellow">please go away.</font>

353
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,870
<font color="yellow">Is that what you want?</font>

354
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,029
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

355
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,900
<font color="yellow">So please leave.</font>

356
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,269
<font color="yellow">And never come here again.</font>

357
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,330
<font color="yellow">I'll ask one last time. Do you...</font>

358
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,769
<font color="yellow">really want me to...</font>

359
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,569
<font color="yellow">give up on you?</font>

360
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

361
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,569
<font color="yellow">I've given up on you.</font>

362
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:28,569
<font color="yellow">However hard it got,</font>

363
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,299
<font color="yellow">I thought we could fight through it together.</font>

364
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,670
<font color="yellow">I was confident we could.</font>

365
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,739
<font color="yellow">I guess I was wrong.</font>

367

00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,969

374
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,229

376

<font color="yellow">- I like the song. It's very catchy. - I agree.</font>

378
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,670

<font color="yellow">Yes. Right.</font>

394

<font color="yellow">Yes. Okay!</font>

397

398
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,400
<font color="yellow">Well, I guess so.</font>

399

400
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:09,069

402
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,269
<font color="yellow">All right. That sounds good.</font>

403
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,269
<font color="yellow">Headaches have so many causes,</font>

404
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,999
<font color="yellow">so I'll need to run some tests.</font>

405

<font color="yellow">Based on your symptoms,</font>

406

00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,930
<font color="yellow">- Who is it at this hour? - I'll get the door!</font>

462
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,069
<font color="yellow">Don't run.</font>

463
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,200
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if you fall?</font>

464
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:02,200
<font color="yellow">Just be careful. The stairs are slippery, you know.</font>

465
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,529
<font color="yellow">I forgot. Sorry, Mum.</font>

466
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,400
<font color="yellow">Who's here this late at night?</font>

467
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
<font color="yellow">Darling!</font>

468
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,469
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is that punk here again...</font>

469
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,969
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling him a punk? Watch your language.</font>

470
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,600
<font color="yellow">Have a seat, my future son-in-law.</font>

471
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,999
<font color="yellow">- "Future son-in-law"? - What does that mean, Madam Ko?</font>

472
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,830
<font color="yellow">You must be tired from work.</font>

473
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,900
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling all right?</font>

474
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:34,330
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling great.</font>

475
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,729
<font color="yellow">Have a seat here, you two.</font>

476
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,269
<font color="yellow">I asked all of you...</font>

477
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,729
<font color="yellow">to gather here today because...</font>

478
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:54,569
<font color="yellow">I want Hyo Won and Tae Yang to get married...</font>

479
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:58,670
<font color="yellow">on the day that Hyo Sang and Ji Yun are supposed to get married.</font>

480
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,630
<font color="yellow">Exactly one month after that,</font>

481
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:07,400
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang and Ji Yun can get married.</font>

482
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,569
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked you all to be here.</font>

483
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:10,729
<font color="yellow">- Mum! - Madam Ko.</font>

484
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:12,670
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that, Madam Ko?</font>

485
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,269
<font color="yellow">Let's just do as Mum says,</font>

486
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:16,469
<font color="yellow">Darling.</font>

487
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:20,229
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to us, Mum?</font>

488
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,499
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to postpone our wedding?</font>

489
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:24,700
<font color="yellow">Why on earth do we have to do that?</font>

490
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,769
<font color="yellow">That is unacceptable, Madam Ko.</font>

491
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,930
<font color="yellow">When an elder says something...</font>

492
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,999
<font color="yellow">"Sure, okay."</font>

493
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:33,400
<font color="yellow">"I'll do as you say." That's all you have to say.</font>

494
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,999
<font color="yellow">Why do you have so much to talk about?</font>

495
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:36,670
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

496
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,799
<font color="yellow">Let me make it clear to you once again.</font>

497
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,729
<font color="yellow">For the life of me,</font>

498
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:44,630
<font color="yellow">I cannot allow Hyo Won and Tae Yang to get married.</font>

499
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,100
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

500
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,630
<font color="yellow">I cannot allow you and Pooper to get married...</font>

501
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,130
<font color="yellow">for the life of me!</font>

502
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,569
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you two?</font>

503
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,029
<font color="yellow">Why can't you allow each other...</font>

504
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,870
<font color="yellow">to get married for the life of you?</font>

505
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,299
<font color="yellow">Why? What's the reason?</font>

506
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,170
<font color="yellow">Tell me!</font>

507
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:16,670
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kang Tae Yang.</font>

508
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,469
<font color="yellow">What on earth did you do to my mum?</font>

509
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:20,700
<font color="yellow">Please let go of me.</font>

510
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,529
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of him immediately or I'll bite you!</font>

511
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,799
<font color="yellow">You little... You're going to bite me as if kicking me wasn't enough?</font>

512
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,930
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

513
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,330
<font color="yellow">Calm down. Your mum will be worried if she finds out about this.</font>

514
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,700
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang didn't do anything wrong.</font>

515
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,870
<font color="yellow">I pestered Mum about allowing us to get married as soon as possible.</font>

516
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,769
<font color="yellow">- Hyo Won. - We might not be able...</font>

517
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,870
<font color="yellow">to get married if Hyo Sang beats us to it.</font>

518
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,870
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean... - Hyo Won now knows everything,</font>

519
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,100
<font color="yellow">you idiot.</font>

520
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,130
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

521
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:49,930
<font color="yellow">- Then... - Yes.</font>

522
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,830
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won is rushing to marry Tae Yang because she found out...</font>

523
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,930
<font color="yellow">that he and you used to date in the past.</font>

524
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,969
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hyo Won. Does it not even bother you...</font>

525
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:01,430
<font color="yellow">that your boyfriend has a past with another woman?</font>

526
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,430
<font color="yellow">Why should it matter?</font>

527
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,299
<font color="yellow">I went on many blind dates and had crushes on many guys, too.</font>

528
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,200
<font color="yellow">What about you? Does it not bother you that Ji Yun used to date him?</font>

529
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can I get jealous of a guy who's nowhere near my league?</font>

530
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,729
<font color="yellow">This guy is nothing compared to me.</font>

531
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:18,499
<font color="yellow">Okay. I feel the same way.</font>

532
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:21,630
<font color="yellow">It's impossible to compare Pooper to me,</font>

533
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,769
<font color="yellow">so it doesn't bother me at all. Not even a tiny bit.</font>

534
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,229
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

535
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,299
<font color="yellow">I should have told you about it first.</font>

536
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,999
<font color="yellow">I was hesitant because I didn't want to hurt you.</font>

537
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:57,400
<font color="yellow">I know that you tried to tell me numerous times...</font>

538
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,229
<font color="yellow">but I stopped you.</font>

539
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:00,830
<font color="yellow">You didn't do...</font>

540
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:02,600
<font color="yellow">anything wrong.</font>

541
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,670
<font color="yellow">Thanks for being so understanding.</font>

542
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,330
<font color="yellow">I really mean it.</font>

543
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,670
<font color="yellow">When I first found out about it, I was surprised and upset.</font>

544
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:12,430
<font color="yellow">But I've decided to be understanding.</font>

545
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,100
<font color="yellow">Past is the past. What matters is to live in the present.</font>

546
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:18,529
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

547
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,670
<font color="yellow">I'll thank you for the rest of my life.</font>

548
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,130
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

549
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,170
<font color="yellow">we'll get married this month, okay?</font>

550
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,229
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of everything from booking a wedding venue...</font>

551
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:29,670
<font color="yellow">to finding a place for us to live,</font>

552
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,870
<font color="yellow">so you just need...</font>

553
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,400
<font color="yellow">to walk down the aisle, okay?</font>

554
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,330
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

555
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:42,400
<font color="yellow">We can't do that.</font>

556
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,830
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - We can't rush it like this.</font>

557
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:52,330
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I said to Mum today to get her approval?</font>

558
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,600
<font color="yellow">Never mind. You don't need to know about that.</font>

559
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,400
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I went through hoops to get her permission,</font>

560
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:03,700
<font color="yellow">and we can now beat Hyo Sang and Pooper by one month.</font>

561
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:06,140
<font color="yellow">Why don't you want to do it?</font>

562
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,930
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get married like this.</font>

563
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,270
<font color="yellow">Why should your brother's marriage affect us?</font>

564
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,029
<font color="yellow">My feelings for you...</font>

565
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,399
<font color="yellow">are solid enough not to get affected by things like that.</font>

566
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:20,969
<font color="yellow">What if my mum finds out...</font>

567
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,529
<font color="yellow">about you and Ji Yun and disapproves of you?</font>

568
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,529
<font color="yellow">I'm confident that I can persuade your mum.</font>

569
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,000
<font color="yellow">I don't feel rushed or anxious at all,</font>

570
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,140
<font color="yellow">so just trust me.</font>

571
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,640
<font color="yellow">You don't love me.</font>

572
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,299
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

573
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,469
<font color="yellow">You can't do this if you love me.</font>

574
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,770
<font color="yellow">Your girlfriend proposed to you first. How can you reject it?</font>

575
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:51,799
<font color="yellow">- That's not what I meant, Hyo Won. - I don't want to hear it.</font>

576
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:58,100
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

577
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,930
<font color="yellow">Don't get me wrong, Hyo Won.</font>

578
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,770
<font color="yellow">Don't drink on an empty stomach.</font>

579
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:17,640
<font color="yellow">I need to drink this to be able to fall asleep.</font>

580
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,230
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

581
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,669
<font color="yellow">I'm so worried about him.</font>

582
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,899
<font color="yellow">I'll ask one last time. Do you...</font>

583
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,370
<font color="yellow">really want me to...</font>

584
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,230
<font color="yellow">give up on you?</font>

585
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,799
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've given up on you.</font>

586
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:49,299
<font color="yellow">However hard it got, I thought we could fight through it together.</font>

587
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:50,830
<font color="yellow">I was confident we could.</font>

588
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,830
<font color="yellow">If I make your life tough, I won't force you.</font>

589
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,100
<font color="yellow">Do you think marriage is a joke or what?</font>

590
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,930
<font color="yellow">How can you talk about it as if it's not a big deal at all?</font>

591
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,930
<font color="yellow">She's doing it for a reason.</font>

592
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,830
<font color="yellow">I must say, you're the one who is acting the strangest.</font>

593
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,930
<font color="yellow">You should be yelling at Hyo Won and going on a hunger strike.</font>

594
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:25,230
<font color="yellow">How can you take her side?</font>

595
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:26,669
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

596
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,140
<font color="yellow">You two are hiding something from me, right?</font>

597
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,640
<font color="yellow">- No, we're not. - No, we're not.</font>

598
00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:34,469
<font color="yellow">Then why are you rushing to get married all of a sudden?</font>

599
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:36,730
<font color="yellow">My gosh! Just eat your food already!</font>

600
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,899
<font color="yellow">Stop talking to me!</font>

601
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,370
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

602
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,299
<font color="yellow">I almost jumped out of my skin.</font>

603
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,770
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

604
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,069
<font color="yellow">Did I startled you a lot?</font>

605
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,830
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

606
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,500
<font color="yellow">- Can you do me a favour? - Sure.</font>

607
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,029
<font color="yellow">For dinner,</font>

608
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,899
<font color="yellow">- buy some oxtails and braise them. - Oxtails?</font>

609
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:05,469
<font color="yellow">Yes. I want Hyo Won to eat something nourishing.</font>

610
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,299
<font color="yellow">Why does she need to eat something nourishing?</font>

611
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:11,969
<font color="yellow">I need it more as I'm burned out from work!</font>

612
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:14,270
<font color="yellow">Fine! You can eat it with her.</font>

613
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,029
<font color="yellow">Gosh, are you two kids or what? Why are you fighting over food?</font>

614
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,899
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

615
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,830
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Hyo Joo?</font>

616
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:24,930
<font color="yellow">She left for work early today.</font>

617
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,270
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

618
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:31,569
<font color="yellow">I asked you all to meet with me even though I know how busy...</font>

619
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:35,230
<font color="yellow">you are because I wanted to discuss the company's future with you.</font>

620
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,569
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, please tell me what you think.</font>

621
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,529
<font color="yellow">Sure. All of you must know that the company...</font>

622
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:43,700
<font color="yellow">is in bad shape overall at the moment.</font>

623
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,370
<font color="yellow">The numbers aren't looking good even after launching...</font>

624
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,399
<font color="yellow">the new outdoor line in which we invested a lot.</font>

625
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:52,029
<font color="yellow">As a result of that, we didn't get proper marketing support...</font>

626
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,370
<font color="yellow">for our off-the-peg clothes,</font>

627
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,830
<font color="yellow">and our sales are dropping overall.</font>

628
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:01,000
<font color="yellow">It could be because Mr Min is young and inexperienced.</font>

629
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,500
<font color="yellow">He hasn't come up with any solution to overcome this crisis.</font>

630
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:06,569
<font color="yellow">I've spoken to a number of our main shareholders,</font>

631
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:08,770
<font color="yellow">and all of them are deeply concerned.</font>

632
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,569
<font color="yellow">Hence, I'd like all of you...</font>

633
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,770
<font color="yellow">to work on appointing Mr Lee Dong Jin as a new CEO...</font>

634

<font color="yellow">who can help the company overcome this crisis...</font>

635
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:18,669
<font color="yellow">as a way of preparing for the upcoming meeting with shareholders.</font>

636
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,569
<font color="yellow">The company has been in a mess ever since you left.</font>

637
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,870
<font color="yellow">Almost all numbers are dropping quickly.</font>

638
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
<font color="yellow">The employees...</font>

639
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,399
<font color="yellow">are very concerned, too.</font>

640
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,830
<font color="yellow">Everyone wants you to come back...</font>

641
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:37,200
<font color="yellow">and sort out the situation.</font>

642
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:40,430
<font color="yellow">Mr Min rushed to launch the new outdoor brand...</font>

643

<font color="yellow">in order to prove himself as a CEO,</font>

644
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:46,399

645

<font color="yellow">All of our major shareholders are deeply concerned, as well.</font>

646
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,640
<font color="yellow">Most importantly, investors are turning...</font>

647
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,200
<font color="yellow">their backs on the company.</font>

648
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,370
<font color="yellow">The value of our stocks have dropped...</font>

649
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,930
<font color="yellow">by 30 percent compared to when you were the CEO.</font>

650
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,169
<font color="yellow">Appointing a new CEO...</font>

651
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,899
<font color="yellow">will be discussed at the upcoming meeting with the shareholders.</font>

652
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,640
<font color="yellow">Please come back for us...</font>

653
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:06,430

654
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:10,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't expect any of this, so all of this is too sudden for me,</font>

655
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,469

00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,799
<font color="yellow">He is still everyone's lover.</font>

764
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:20,870
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil.</font>

765
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:25,669
<font color="yellow">Do you know what look you have on your face?</font>

766
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,669
<font color="yellow">You worry about Dong Jin and you feel terrible.</font>

767
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,000
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin has the same look on his face.</font>

768
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,069
<font color="yellow">You should cheer him up. Please do that for me.</font>

769
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,500
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm capable of.</font>

770
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,069
<font color="yellow">You're not doing him any good by running away like this.</font>

771
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,299
<font color="yellow">I like Dong Jin a lot.</font>

772
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,069
<font color="yellow">If I'm by his side,</font>

773
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,629
<font color="yellow">he might get hurt.</font>

774
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,569
<font color="yellow">And for his family, too.</font>

775
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,969
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I can live with that.</font>

776
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,969
<font color="yellow">Why is life so hard and difficult?</font>

777
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,029
<font color="yellow">This is so hard.</font>

778
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,169
<font color="yellow">I know how you feel, but do think it over.</font>

779
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,430
<font color="yellow">The harder it is, the more you should rely on each other.</font>

780
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:24,000
<font color="yellow">I don't think what you're doing is right.</font>

781
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:33,669
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

782
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,129
<font color="yellow">I just have a little cold.</font>

783
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:40,000
<font color="yellow">You should go. You said you have work.</font>

784
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,100
<font color="yellow">Both you and Dong Jin don't look very good.</font>

785
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,100
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

786
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:48,969
<font color="yellow">This was sent to you. Dong Jin wanted me to give you this.</font>

787
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,830
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here.</font>

788
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,830
<font color="yellow">I'll go for now. I'll be back later.</font>

789
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:03,000
<font color="yellow">Don't leave your phone off and stay here.</font>

790
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,430
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

791
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,029
<font color="yellow">It's me, Dong Jin.</font>

792
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:29,230
<font color="yellow">I just met Yun Shil.</font>

793
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,669
<font color="yellow">I gave her what you asked me to.</font>

794
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,200
<font color="yellow">Okay, thanks.</font>

795
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,399
<font color="yellow">I wish I could tell you...</font>

796
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,569
<font color="yellow">she's doing well.</font>

797
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,000
<font color="yellow">But I don't think she is.</font>

798
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
<font color="yellow">She even looked sick from a cold.</font>

799
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,000
<font color="yellow">Did she take medication?</font>

800
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:47,930
<font color="yellow">She should go to the hospital.</font>

801
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,629
<font color="yellow">If you worry her so much, you should've gone there yourself.</font>

802
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,469
<font color="yellow">This is hard for you and Yun Shil.</font>

803
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,830
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why both of you are being like this.</font>

804
00:48:58,129 --> 00:49:01,569
<font color="yellow">I don't want to make things harder for Yun Shil.</font>

805
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:03,270
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil didn't leave...</font>

806
00:49:04,629 --> 00:49:06,830
<font color="yellow">because you made it hard for her.</font>

807
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,200
<font color="yellow">It's because she was afraid of hurting you.</font>

808
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,529
<font color="yellow">That is why I am more upset.</font>

809
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,230
<font color="yellow">I should be the one protecting her and someone she can rely on.</font>

810
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:19,629
<font color="yellow">Why would she run away trying to protect me?</font>

811
00:49:19,629 --> 00:49:21,029
<font color="yellow">So you're upset...</font>

812
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,600
<font color="yellow">because she didn't rely on you. Is that right?</font>

813
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:28,399
<font color="yellow">Should I say you're sullen?</font>

814
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,629
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

815
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:33,370
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil had a look on her face...</font>

816
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,469
<font color="yellow">that says she can't stand not seeing you.</font>

817
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,930
<font color="yellow">You had the same look, too.</font>

818
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,270
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

819
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,830
<font color="yellow">Being stubborn runs in you both.</font>

820
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,730
<font color="yellow">Let's hang up.</font>

821
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,830
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

822
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,069
<font color="yellow">I need to talk.</font>

823
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,000
<font color="yellow">I've been absent for too long. I have to go back soon.</font>

824
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:09,799
<font color="yellow">Make it short.</font>

825
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:16,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Tae Yang.</font>

826
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,270
<font color="yellow">I know it's been hard on you because of me.</font>

827
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,730
<font color="yellow">You must have felt betrayed.</font>

828
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,500
<font color="yellow">I said most of those things...</font>

829
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,169
<font color="yellow">to purposefully distant myself from you.</font>

830
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,600
<font color="yellow">That's why I was so cruel.</font>

831
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,730
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that now?</font>

832
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:42,700
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

833
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:45,330
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

834
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,169
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

835
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:56,399
<font color="yellow">Why are you begging me?</font>

836
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,469
<font color="yellow">- Are you trying to get back at... - I told you many times.</font>

837
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,200
<font color="yellow">You're not someone I want to have revenge on.</font>

838
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,930
<font color="yellow">Having revenge requires interest in that person.</font>

839
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,870
<font color="yellow">Even though it's long in the past, we used to love each other.</font>

840
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,169
<font color="yellow">I'm not that low of a person to avenge someone like that.</font>

841
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,270
<font color="yellow">So don't get any wrong idea.</font>

842
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,870
<font color="yellow">If you're not trying to get back at me,</font>

843
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,469
<font color="yellow">please don't marry Hyo Won. Please.</font>

844
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:22,500
<font color="yellow">Are you that insecure about your relationship?</font>

845
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,770
<font color="yellow">- What? - It has nothing to do with you...</font>

846
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,200
<font color="yellow">whether I marry Hyo Won or not.</font>

847
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:31,069
<font color="yellow">I'm not ready yet, so I can't do that right now.</font>

848
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:32,629
<font color="yellow">But one day,</font>

849
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,169
<font color="yellow">I will definitely marry her.</font>

850
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:37,899
<font color="yellow">So don't stick your nose in my love life.</font>

851
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,430
<font color="yellow">I'm not intending on interfering with yours, either.</font>

852
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,169
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get married like this.</font>

853
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:12,830
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

854
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,569
<font color="yellow">I want to see you right now.</font>

855
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:19,600
<font color="yellow">I'm not that idle of a person to meet someone who doesn't love me.</font>

856
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,000
<font color="yellow">I'll wait until you come out.</font>

857
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,000
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

858
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,700
<font color="yellow">I asked you what this is.</font>

859
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,069
<font color="yellow">Can't you read? It's divorce paper.</font>

860
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:49,069
<font color="yellow">And why are you giving it to me?</font>

861
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:50,430
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

862
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,629
<font color="yellow">You should live with a woman you want to be with.</font>

863
00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:56,069
<font color="yellow">I'll let you go now.</font>

864
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:58,500
<font color="yellow">You can fly away to your first love.</font>

865
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:00,270
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

866
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,299
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

867
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,600
<font color="yellow">this is alimony.</font>

868
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,799
<font color="yellow">- Alimony? - I should've made more money.</font>

869
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,029
<font color="yellow">It's not a lot.</font>

870
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:11,330
<font color="yellow">It's not a lot,</font>

871
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,370
<font color="yellow">but I want you to have it. Please accept it.</font>

872
00:53:15,469 --> 00:53:18,069
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this? You're scaring me?</font>

873
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,830
<font color="yellow">Why would you be scared? I'm granting your wish.</font>

874
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that woman?</font>

875
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:33,299
<font color="yellow">Why is she acting like she's going to die tomorrow?</font>

876
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,299
<font color="yellow">Lucky you, Sam Do.</font>

877
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:48,169
<font color="yellow">You won the lottery.</font>

878
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,270
<font color="yellow">Why would someone who doesn't want to get married...</font>

879
00:54:26,899 --> 00:54:28,200
<font color="yellow">go on a date?</font>

880
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,770
<font color="yellow">You know that's not true. Why do you keep being unreasonable?</font>

881
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:34,730
<font color="yellow">I hate you so much.</font>

882
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,230
<font color="yellow">If you keep being mean, I won't give you the gift.</font>

883
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,799
<font color="yellow">A gift?</font>

884
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,129
<font color="yellow">What is this? You must like gifts more than me.</font>

885
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,169
<font color="yellow">What's the gift?</font>

886
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,930
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm some kind of a baby?</font>

887
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,870
<font color="yellow">Oh, you don't like cotton candy?</font>

888
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:04,529
<font color="yellow">- I'll eat it, then. - No.</font>

889
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,730
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. It's mine.</font>

890
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,730
<font color="yellow">I haven't had cotton candy for so long.</font>

891
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,430
<font color="yellow">It must be because it's festive season.</font>

892
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,230
<font color="yellow">They were selling cotton candy nearby.</font>

893
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:17,770
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

894
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,569
<font color="yellow">It melts in my mouth.</font>

895
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,770
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

896
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:36,430
<font color="yellow">You were really upset...</font>

897
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:38,169
<font color="yellow">because of me yesterday, right?</font>

898
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,200
<font color="yellow">I trust you, Hyo Won.</font>

899
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,529
<font color="yellow">So I don't feel pressured...</font>

900
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,270
<font color="yellow">or anxious. You must not trust me.</font>

901
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,169
<font color="yellow">I finished it already.</font>

902
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:50,469
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - It's for you.</font>

903
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
<font color="yellow">It's for me?</font>

904
00:56:56,129 --> 00:56:59,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not ready yet and don't have much...</font>

905
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,399
<font color="yellow">so I can't officially propose to you.</font>

906
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,469
<font color="yellow">But Hyo Won is mine.</font>

907
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,430
<font color="yellow">I want to tie you down with this ring.</font>

908
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,629
<font color="yellow">This feels nice.</font>

909
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:25,330
<font color="yellow">It doesn't have jewelry, but I put my heart in it.</font>

910
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:27,330
<font color="yellow">Will you happily accept it?</font>

911
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,629
<font color="yellow">If it's a ring coming from your heart,</font>

912
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,899
<font color="yellow">it has to be the most expensive ring in the world.</font>

913
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won...</font>
