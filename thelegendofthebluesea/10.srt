1
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,800
<font color="yellow">If you are my reincarnation,</font>

2
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
<font color="yellow">even if you wake up from your dream, remember these words:</font>

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,400
<font color="yellow">Everything is repeating.</font>

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,880
<font color="yellow">The relationships in this place are continuing there.</font>

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,400
<font color="yellow">Even the bad relationships.</font>

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,600
<font color="yellow">From the dangerous ones,</font>

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,640
<font color="yellow">you must</font>

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,880
<font color="yellow">protect that woman.</font>

9
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,240
<font color="yellow">On the way to Hanyang, give this to my mother.</font>

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, Master.</font>

11
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,840
<font color="yellow">If anything should happen to me, to not open it</font>

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,840
<font color="yellow">and to leave it in that place.</font>

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,600
<font color="yellow">If something should happen? What are you referring to?</font>

14
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,360
<font color="yellow">I ask of you.</font>

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,360
<font color="yellow">What are you?</font>

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,040
<font color="yellow">Who is the dangerous one, and who is the woman?</font>

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,240
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
<font color="yellow">Are you really... me?</font>

19
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,280
<font color="yellow">Not a dream... but really me?</font>

20
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,880
<font color="yellow">The Legend of the Blue Sea</font>

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae, I think the power's out.</font>

22
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,800
<font color="yellow">Why is the light like this all of a sudden? I was so scared alone.</font>

23
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,280
<font color="yellow">You're not scared anymore, right?</font>

24
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm fine now.</font>

25
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,800
<font color="yellow">Anyway, did you get a good look?</font>

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,480
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's go.</font>

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,440
<font color="yellow">You're going to look at it by yourself? I want to see, too.</font>

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,360
<font color="yellow">It's raining outside and getting late. Don't you have to get home?</font>

29
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,600
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

30
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,640
<font color="yellow">You saw all of it, right? Let's go.</font>

31
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,480
<font color="yellow">You felt it, too, right&gt; It looks exactly like you.</font>

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,440
<font color="yellow">Like me?</font>

33
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,800
<font color="yellow">You can't tell?</font>

34
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,880
<font color="yellow">Does having big eyes and being handsome make them all look like me?</font>

35
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,000
<font color="yellow">No, it really looks like you.</font>

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
<font color="yellow">Well, I think...</font>

37
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,480
<font color="yellow">I look better.</font>

38
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,240
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

39
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,360
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, he's your ancestor.</font>

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,600
<font color="yellow">No wait, you're a Heo. Maybe, he's from your mother's side?</font>

41
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like that?</font>

42
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,840
<font color="yellow">This is weird. Maybe, you were really interested in Kim Dam Ryeong</font>

43
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,360
<font color="yellow">because of the blood relation.</font>

44
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,760
<font color="yellow">- Cha Si Ah.  - Yes?</font>

45
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,880
<font color="yellow">- The fact that we came here...  - Yeah.</font>

46
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,480
<font color="yellow">Let's just keep that to ourselves.</font>

47
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,080
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

48
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,520
<font color="yellow">This is place is off-limits to unauthorized personnel. I don't want to get you in trouble,</font>

49
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,080
<font color="yellow">and I'm in the middle of figuring something out. I would like it if only you knew about this.</font>

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,000
<font color="yellow">Sure, I'll do that.</font>

51
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
<font color="yellow">Episode 10</font>

52
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,080
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, why won't you come back after getting Cha Si Ah's phone call?</font>

53
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, what time is it, right now?</font>

54
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,000
<font color="yellow">Right now? 11pm.</font>

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,680
<font color="yellow">What time is our curfew. 8pm, right?</font>

56
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,600
<font color="yellow">You told me not to come back if I was going to break the curfew.</font>

57
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,880
<font color="yellow">That applies only to free-loaders that live in my house, not to me.</font>

58
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,680
<font color="yellow">- Why not?  - Because, I'm the house owner.</font>

59
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,840
<font color="yellow">Is it usually like that, here?</font>

60
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,080
<font color="yellow">Yes. Everything is the way the house owner wants it to be.</font>

61
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,480
<font color="yellow">That's the rule.</font>

62
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,280
<font color="yellow">If you think it's unfair, buy and house yourself, and live there.</font>

63
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you scared me.</font>

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,080
<font color="yellow">When you stare at me like that, you look like a ghost. Stop looking!</font>

65
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,520
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep looking at you like this.</font>

66
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,280
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

67
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
<font color="yellow">They're my eyes. Since, I'm the owner,</font>

68
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,480
<font color="yellow">I decide if I want to stare at you or look at you normally.</font>

69
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,320
<font color="yellow">This is my rule, to stare at you when I'm angry but have nothing to say.</font>

70
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,040
<font color="yellow">- So? You're going to keep looking at me like that?  - Yes.</font>

71
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

72
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,800
<font color="yellow">Because I want to look at you to make up for the time I couldn't look at you.</font>

73
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,280
<font color="yellow">Do as you like. You'll probably be dizzy.</font>

74
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,240
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

75
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,040
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you something.</font>

76
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,360
<font color="yellow">When you got into that car accident, at the ER...</font>

78
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,280
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

79
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,560
<font color="yellow">You said that you had a dream, right?</font>

80
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,440
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae</font>

81
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

82
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,920
<font color="yellow">I had a dream.</font>

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,880
<font color="yellow">You held my hand.</font>

84
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,320
<font color="yellow">You rescued me.</font>

85
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you're right. I did.</font>

86
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,840
<font color="yellow">What kind of dream?</font>

87
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,040
<font color="yellow">So, in the dream, how did I save you?</font>

88
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,720
<font color="yellow">I mean, there are several ways to save a person.</font>

89
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
<font color="yellow">I could have grabbed you when you were about to fall off a high place,</font>

90
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,680
<font color="yellow">or I could have lifted you out of a deep pit.</font>

91
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
<font color="yellow">How did I do it?</font>

92
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,080
<font color="yellow">You don't remember? Okay.</font>

93
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,760
<font color="yellow">Then, what about the time period? What time period was it?</font>

94
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,560
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, was I wearing traditional clothes?</font>

95
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,880
<font color="yellow">You know what traditional clothes look like, right?</font>

96
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,920
<font color="yellow">You know that drama you like, The Crown Prince's Woman? Clothes that they wear in that.</font>

97
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,040
<font color="yellow">- The thing is...  - Yes?</font>

98
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,680
<font color="yellow">- The thing is, I don't really remember.</font>

99
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,200
<font color="yellow">I really can't remember it at all.</font>

100
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm sure that's the case.</font>

101
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,360
<font color="yellow">You can't even remember your own name. How would you remember that?</font>

102
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go back up.</font>

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,680
<font color="yellow">Okay. Heo Joon Jae, sleep well!</font>

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,480
<font color="yellow">What was that? She said she would watch me all night.</font>

105
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,440
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it now, she really doesn't responsibility for her words.</font>

106
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,920
<font color="yellow">I feel restless for no reason, now.</font>

107
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,400
<font color="yellow">So this what lying feels like.</font>

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,200
<font color="yellow">It makes my heart pound a little, but it is convenient.</font>

109
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing Heo Joon Jae didn't hear my real voice.</font>

110
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,480
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

111
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
<font color="yellow">I came too late.</font>

112
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

113
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing coming out in the middle of sleeping?</font>

114
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,520
<font color="yellow">Give me one too.</font>

115
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
<font color="yellow">I'm really a little strange these days.</font>

116
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,560
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you dream about being Kim Dam Ryeong again?</font>

117
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,600
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

118
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,360
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae.</font>

119
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,840
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you have to find the strangest?</font>

120
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,560
<font color="yellow">- What?    - Cheong.</font>

121
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
<font color="yellow">Isn't Cheong strange these days?</font>

122
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,200
<font color="yellow">She's originally a little strange.</font>

123
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,200
<font color="yellow">Again... don't try to just gloss over it like that again.</font>

124
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
<font color="yellow">Fine, Cheong is pretty and sweet-hearted,</font>

125
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
<font color="yellow">She's seems as if she's from an entirely different world</font>

126
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,200
<font color="yellow">but she's strange.</font>

127
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,400
<font color="yellow">Truthfully, last time, when we went to the hospital I asked for Cheong's xray films and showed them to a doctor hyung I know.</font>

128
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
<font color="yellow">Why did you do something like that?!</font>

129
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,080
<font color="yellow">Don't get all worked up and just listen. They said the films got switched but I didn't think so.</font>

130
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,800
<font color="yellow">If you were your normal self you would have been suspicious, also but you seem be letting your wits go when it comes to Cheong these days.</font>

131
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,240
<font color="yellow">And.</font>

132
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,720
<font color="yellow">He says the pictures weren't switched?</font>

133
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,040
<font color="yellow">He says that it's definitely the films of one person.</font>

134
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,640
<font color="yellow">A bone that may not have even reattached after 6 weeks</font>

135
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,760
<font color="yellow">attached after not even a week, and she was perfectly sprightly even after that.</font>

136
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,280
<font color="yellow">Isn't it strange?</font>

137
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,280
<font color="yellow">And this.</font>

138
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,400
<font color="yellow">A kid that has no job or skills here</font>

139
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,320
<font color="yellow">keeps this kind of thing in a plastic bag, this much worth,</font>

140
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,160
<font color="yellow">saying she'll sell all of it and give it to you.</font>

141
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,840
<font color="yellow">Where did she get this?</font>

142
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,520
<font color="yellow">That's what I don't know.</font>

143
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
<font color="yellow">It's certain that you met Cheong in Spain</font>

144
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
<font color="yellow">but you still can't remember it all this time.</font>

145
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,360
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that is?</font>

146
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,400
<font color="yellow">You said that was why you were letting Cheong live in this house.</font>

147
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,080
<font color="yellow">You must not even be curious of that anymore, huh?</font>

148
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,240
<font color="yellow">Then what about you, Hyung? Why are you curious about that?</font>

149
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,240
<font color="yellow">Me? I'm afraid that you'll become a good guy, Joon Jae.</font>

150
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,600
<font color="yellow">I've barely made you a bad guy and now you're useful.</font>

151
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,800
<font color="yellow">After meeting Cheong you seem to wanting to become a good guy so it's giving me cause for concern.</font>

152
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,080
<font color="yellow">If you become a good guy you'll leave me.</font>

153
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,160
<font color="yellow">You're saying all kinds of useless things.</font>

154
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,440
<font color="yellow">I'm curious as to what kind of kid she is too. It's fun, right?</font>

155
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,880
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make sure to find out. Oh, I've got to pee.</font>

156
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,840
<font color="yellow">I think I've got to be the first to find out what kind of kid you are.</font>

157
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,440
<font color="yellow">Squad Chief, look at this.</font>

158
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

159
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,600
<font color="yellow">I looked through Ma Dae Young's previous convictions records again.</font>

160
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,320
<font color="yellow">I told you to catch him. Why were you looking through his previous conviction records again?</font>

161
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
<font color="yellow">He's got 23 previous convictions mostly for violence. Why?</font>

162
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,120
<font color="yellow">Because he has an anger management control defect. But there's something that's strange.</font>

163
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

164
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,760
<font color="yellow">From '88-'89, in the space of this one year he commits over thirty cases of burglary.</font>

165
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,320
<font color="yellow">And at a department store in Seongnam,</font>

166
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,360
<font color="yellow">in a mart shopping mall.</font>

167
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,280
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young Record    Serious Crime Squad</font>

168
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

169
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
<font color="yellow">During this time,</font>

170
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,000
<font color="yellow">he had a woman.</font>

171
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Father?</font>

172
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,080
<font color="yellow">Honey. Make sure to take your medicine well after eating your meal.</font>

173
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,240
<font color="yellow">It's really a concern.</font>

174
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
<font color="yellow">It keeps getting worse.</font>

175
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,400
<font color="yellow">Honey, don't go to work today and stay home.</font>

176
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,080
<font color="yellow">If there's something important tell me.</font>

177
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,240
<font color="yellow">I'll relay it to Secretary Kim.</font>

178
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,600
<font color="yellow">Eat Father.</font>

179
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,200
<font color="yellow">Yuna. Today is Korean Language reinforcement. Don't be late.</font>

180
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,200
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if you get the pink octopus?</font>

181
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,280
<font color="yellow">-Hi.</font>

182
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,160
<font color="yellow">But how did you know about this place?</font>

183
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,080
<font color="yellow">I didn't go to school today, but upon not going to school I suddenly had no place to go.</font>

184
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,480
<font color="yellow">I remembered you said you lived in this neighborhood before so I tried coming this way.</font>

185
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
<font color="yellow">But how did you know that I thought that I had to pull out the pink octopus no matter what?</font>

186
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,200
<font color="yellow">I knew since you said it.</font>

187
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,080
<font color="yellow">When I was coming up behind you kept saying it that you wanted to make sure to pull that one.</font>

188
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,840
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

189
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,160
<font color="yellow">That wasn't a voice you could hear.</font>

190
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
<font color="yellow">Well anyway, I heard.</font>

191
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
<font color="yellow">Watch.</font>

192
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,280
<font color="yellow">I got it, right?</font>

193
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sim Cheong.</font>

194
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,080
<font color="yellow">Where did she go again?</font>

195
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,800
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, she gets around well.</font>

196
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
<font color="yellow">Really.</font>

197
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,400
<font color="yellow">Where did she get all of these?</font>

198
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,120
<font color="yellow">But</font>

199
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,000
<font color="yellow">why is she saying that she'll make money and give it all to me? When did I ask her for money? What is it?</font>

200
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,120
<font color="yellow">Oh yes. Oh Baek's mother. You called again.</font>

201
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,840
<font color="yellow">Of course I did speak to him.</font>

202
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,560
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to schedule appointments with our president. He's originally so busy an individual...</font>

203
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll try to speak to him further about it but please don't have any large expectations.</font>

204
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,320
<font color="yellow">Aigoo, yes, yes. Yes.</font>

205
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, this ahjumma is really hyped up.</font>

206
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,280
<font color="yellow">Why are you so hyper now?</font>

207
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,520
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for someone? Cheong?</font>

208
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,640
<font color="yellow">No. Where's Tae Oh?</font>

209
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,480
<font color="yellow">Are you really a con artist? Why are you so bad at lying?</font>

210
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,480
<font color="yellow">Hey, did I tell you to charge you cell phone or not?</font>

211
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you carry it around turned off? Is it a device? Is it a weapon?</font>

212
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,920
<font color="yellow">- It's dead.    - It's not dead but it's turned off.</font>

213
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,160
<font color="yellow">Give it some food. You don't miss out on one meal for yourself and eat so well</font>

214
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,600
<font color="yellow">but don't you get the idea that he might be hungry?</font>

215
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,040
<font color="yellow">The phone gets discharged. It's not that it's hungry.</font>

216
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,200
<font color="yellow">- What are you about?    - She's my friend.</font>

217
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

218
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,240
<font color="yellow">Why are all your friends like that? Last time it was a beggar, this time it's a elementary schooler?</font>

219
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,040
<font color="yellow">Ahjussi, (you're one to talk), you're unemployed.</font>

220
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,640
<font color="yellow">Who is an ahjussi and who is a bum? You're wrong on both counts.</font>

221
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,240
<font color="yellow">At a time when others are going to work if you're lazing about the house,</font>

222
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,560
<font color="yellow">laying down and watching TV, or playing games, they said you were unemployed.</font>

223
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, you're unemployed?   - I'm not unemployed.</font>

224
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,320
<font color="yellow">I'm... a freelancer.</font>

225
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,800
<font color="yellow">It's a specialized job so I can work from home.</font>

226
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,800
<font color="yellow">That's true. Heo Joon Jae is a person who works for the country more diligently than a civil servant.</font>

227
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,440
<font color="yellow">He redistributes parts when needed also. So when you grow up later you have to become like Heo Joon Jae.</font>

228
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,120
<font color="yellow">You can't!</font>

229
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,240
<font color="yellow">Do you think that just anyone can become like me?</font>

230
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,680
<font color="yellow">Wait, but did that little one already start winter break?</font>

231
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,200
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to school?</font>

232
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,160
<font color="yellow">Are you cutting school?!</font>

233
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,560
<font color="yellow">Why are you skipping school and coming here?!</font>

234
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,800
<font color="yellow">You said that you were wiring this money to America, right?</font>

235
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,640
<font color="yellow">There's usually a wire transfer fee of 20,000 won that's added and allocations...</font>

236
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

237
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,760
<font color="yellow">There's also something called a overseas brokerage fee that's added separately.</font>

238
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,920
<font color="yellow">If you look at this it will be a little easier to understand.</font>

239
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,360
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to go to school.</font>

240
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,800
<font color="yellow">Why won't you going to school?</font>

241
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
<font color="yellow">You didn't go to school and left home too.</font>

242
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
<font color="yellow">For me it was when I was in high school. She's in elementary school, right now.</font>

243
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,160
<font color="yellow">She has to go to school. She has to learn her equations.</font>

244
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,720
<font color="yellow">Tell us. There has to be a reason.</font>

245
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,520
<font color="yellow">Are those kids from before bothering you again?</font>

246
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,040
<font color="yellow">Whenever I go to school I develop supernatural powers.</font>

247
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,120
<font color="yellow">What supernatural power?</font>

248
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,040
<font color="yellow">I become an invisible person. The kids, no one can see me well.</font>

249
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,320
<font color="yellow">They don't speak to me either. So I don't have to go to school.</font>

250
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,120
<font color="yellow">As it is, no one knows even if I don't go.</font>

251
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,440
<font color="yellow">Why do the kids do that?</font>

252
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,440
<font color="yellow">Since I'm different that the other kids.</font>

253
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
<font color="yellow">Where I live is different, and since I only live with my mom. I think that's why.</font>

254
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,800
<font color="yellow">People originally, don't they dislike people who are different from themselves?</font>

255
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:41,440
<font color="yellow">I'm different too. Heo Joon Jae will probably dislike me too if he realizes I'm different.</font>

256
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,560
<font color="yellow">He'll probably leave, right?</font>

257
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,160
<font color="yellow">Why are you different?</font>

258
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,320
<font color="yellow">If you're different will the ahjussi called Heo Joon Jae dislike you and leave you?</font>

259
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,160
<font color="yellow">What? What's different and what does Heo Joon Jae dislike?</font>

260
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,440
<font color="yellow">Just now Unni said so.</font>

261
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,640
<font color="yellow">- Did you hear it?    - No.</font>

262
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,720
<font color="yellow">Our Little One skipped school for the first time in her life and must have strained herself from the nerves, hearing imaginary things.</font>

263
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,880
<font color="yellow">That's not so. I definitely heard it.</font>

264
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,600
<font color="yellow">Want to go to Unni's room? Let's go.</font>

265
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,440
<font color="yellow">You both really didn't hear what that Little One said, right?</font>

266
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,480
<font color="yellow">Hear what? I didn't hear anything. Did you hear something?</font>

267
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,040
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

268
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ahjummoni.</font>

269
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,320
<font color="yellow">Ahjussi did?</font>

270
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,080
<font color="yellow">Can you really hear my what I'm saying?</font>

271
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,000
<font color="yellow">Tell me as soon as you can hear me.</font>

272
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,800
<font color="yellow">I came from a far away place.</font>

273
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
<font color="yellow">I came from a far away place.</font>

274
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,000
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

275
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,360
<font color="yellow">So I'm lonely too. I came all the way here looking only at one man.</font>

276
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,440
<font color="yellow">So I'm lonely too. I came all the way here looking only at one man.</font>

277
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
<font color="yellow">It's real. You can really hear the entirety of my voice.</font>

278
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,000
<font color="yellow">Can other people not hear it?</font>

279
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,560
<font color="yellow">But don't tell this to anyone else.</font>

280
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,280
<font color="yellow">You said it before. People dislike people who are different from themselves.</font>

281
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,240
<font color="yellow">There will be big trouble if Heo Joon Jae dislikes me so don't tell this to anyone.</font>

282
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll promise.</font>

283
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,320
<font color="yellow">Promise. You promised.</font>

284
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,480
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

285
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,320
<font color="yellow">Ahjussi!</font>

286
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,160
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae.</font>

287
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,800
<font color="yellow">It's such a relief that you gained consciousness.</font>

288
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,200
<font color="yellow">But he can just open his eyes. He can't talk or move.</font>

289
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,640
<font color="yellow">I prayed just for him not to die, but now that he's awake</font>

290
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,920
<font color="yellow">I'm becoming more greedy.</font>

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,400
<font color="yellow">I wish he would just talk or he would just move his finger.</font>

292
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,720
<font color="yellow">He will get better. He has overcome the brink of death.</font>

293
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,280
<font color="yellow">Why is this man like this?</font>

294
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,200
<font color="yellow">He must have something he wants to tell you.</font>

295
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,280
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae.</font>

296
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,840
<font color="yellow">Have you heard any news from your mother?</font>

297
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
<font color="yellow">No. Why?</font>

298
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,440
<font color="yellow">Perhaps... have you heard news about my mother?</font>

299
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,160
<font color="yellow">The truth is... before I used to get calls from your mother sometimes.</font>

300
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
<font color="yellow">She called?</font>

301
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,680
<font color="yellow">She told me not to tell anyone so I wasn't able to tell you. I'm sorry.</font>

302
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

303
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,560
<font color="yellow">That, I don't know.</font>

304
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,040
<font color="yellow">Her last call was a few years back.</font>

305
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,080
<font color="yellow">She just asks news about you.</font>

306
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,320
<font color="yellow">I wasn't able to tell her you ran away.</font>

307
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,080
<font color="yellow">I told her not to worry since you went to a good college and went to study abroad.</font>

308
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,200
<font color="yellow">I just told her those.</font>

309
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,880
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, what are you doing?</font>

310
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,680
<font color="yellow">Don't come down.</font>

311
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

312
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,360
<font color="yellow">You know what "don't come down" means, right?</font>

313
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,720
<font color="yellow">Is this alcohol?</font>

314
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,440
<font color="yellow">You also know that?</font>

315
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,280
<font color="yellow">I saw it a lot on TV.</font>

316
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,440
<font color="yellow">When people drink this, they laugh, cry, talk, fight</font>

317
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,600
<font color="yellow">and sleep on the streets.</font>

318
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,280
<font color="yellow">That... is all what Hyung Nam Doo does.</font>

319
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,680
<font color="yellow">Do you know why his nickname is dog Nam Doo?</font>

320
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,680
<font color="yellow">It's because he becomes a dog when he drinks.</font>

321
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,760
<font color="yellow">Acting cute that he doesn't know how to do, calling his ex or current girlfriend and bothering them.</font>

322
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,560
<font color="yellow">He keeps on repeating what he says and always denies being drunk.</font>

323
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,640
<font color="yellow">That is because of learning about alcohol first the wrong way.</font>

324
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,720
<font color="yellow">In my case, I don't necessarily like alcohol.</font>

325
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,280
<font color="yellow">That's why I can enjoy alcohol why controlling it.</font>

326
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,080
<font color="yellow">Then, Heo Joon Jae, teach me about alcohol.</font>

327
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,200
<font color="yellow">You want to?</font>

328
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,560
<font color="yellow">You... do you want to have a drink with me?</font>

329
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,800
<font color="yellow">Here, alcohol...</font>

330
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,440
<font color="yellow">You can't learn to drink it like that.</font>

331
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,320
<font color="yellow">Do you know why you're drinking? You're drinking to cheer.</font>

332
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,560
<font color="yellow">Cheers?</font>

333
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,160
<font color="yellow">Hold it up like this.</font>

334
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,120
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

335
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,120
<font color="yellow">I like "cheers" so much. Let's cheers again.</font>

336
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,640
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

337
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,480
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

338
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
<font color="yellow">Cheers.  - Let's cheer again.</font>

339
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,240
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

340
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you so dry like this?</font>

341
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,240
<font color="yellow">It is dried. It's dried octopus.</font>

342
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,360
<font color="yellow">People are so cruel.</font>

343
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,680
<font color="yellow">How could they</font>

344
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,240
<font color="yellow">cook, slice, dry</font>

345
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
<font color="yellow">and those to you?</font>

346
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,680
<font color="yellow">He's so pitiful.</font>

347
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,880
<font color="yellow">For a person who goes wild over sashimi.</font>

348
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
<font color="yellow">He is different. To me, an octopus is</font>

349
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,800
<font color="yellow">like a dog to you humans.</font>

350
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,200
<font color="yellow">You don't know how well they stick to you.</font>

351
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,320
<font color="yellow">"You humans?"</font>

352
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,520
<font color="yellow">Then aren't you one?</font>

353
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,240
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

354
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,280
<font color="yellow">You say, you're not?</font>

355
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,640
<font color="yellow">If not, what are you?</font>

356
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,560
<font color="yellow">I am... a me...</font>

357
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,840
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, I was drunk a while ago, right?</font>

358
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,440
<font color="yellow">Did you wake up?</font>

359
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,280
<font color="yellow">Oh... I was so dizzy just a while ago.</font>

360
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,640
<font color="yellow">But I just got to my senses all of a sudden. Here, let's cheers.</font>

361
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,360
<font color="yellow">Wow. You're recovery ability is great.</font>

362
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,360
<font color="yellow">Know that it's a relief that you're learning from me.</font>

363
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,480
<font color="yellow">In my case, I don't particularly like alcohol.</font>

364
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,680
<font color="yellow">That's why I can enjoy while controlling it.</font>

365
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,720
<font color="yellow">You also said that earlier.</font>

366
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,880
<font color="yellow">That's why you should think it's a relief.</font>

367
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,720
<font color="yellow">In my case, I don't particularly like alcohol</font>

368
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,800
<font color="yellow">so I can control, control, control...</font>

369
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,400
<font color="yellow">You should really think it's a relief.</font>

370
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,560
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae.   - Why?</font>

371
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
<font color="yellow">No one can go home.</font>

372
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,280
<font color="yellow">This is home though, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

373
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,120
<font color="yellow">Especially you.</font>

374
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

375
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,280
<font color="yellow">You can't go. You can't go.</font>

376
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,240
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

377
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,280
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

378
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,320
<font color="yellow">I'm not going. And I don't have a place to go.</font>

379
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,480
<font color="yellow">Just you try to leave your phone off.</font>

380
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,080
<font color="yellow">I... told you clearly.</font>

381
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,320
<font color="yellow">If it's not at home, you should stay by my side.</font>

382
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,360
<font color="yellow">But then... you don't understand. You don't listen.</font>

383
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,440
<font color="yellow">My phone.  - Hey!</font>

384
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,560
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Don't move.</font>

385
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,280
<font color="yellow">Stay here.</font>

386
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,480
<font color="yellow">The person you are calling cannot answer...</font>

387
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,640
<font color="yellow">Sh'es not answering again.</font>

388
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,320
<font color="yellow">She always ignores my calls.</font>

389
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,160
<font color="yellow">Sim Cheong! Sim Cheong! Sim Cheong!</font>

390
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,240
<font color="yellow">I didn't buy you a phone for this.</font>

391
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,680
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

392
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,240
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Come here.</font>

393
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,000
<font color="yellow">-  More than any word your eyes  -</font>

394
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,880
<font color="yellow">You can't go! Anywhere!</font>

395
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,760
<font color="yellow">- mean more, I can sense it -</font>

396
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,440
<font color="yellow">I'm not going, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

397
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,000
<font color="yellow">- In last night's dream while you smiled -</font>

398
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,080
<font color="yellow">Alcohol is really good.</font>

399
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,240
<font color="yellow">I think alcohol is the greatest thing.</font>

400
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,360
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

401
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,240
<font color="yellow">- On the path I walked alone -</font>

402
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,280
<font color="yellow">Even if we are different</font>

403
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,720
<font color="yellow">- Why will I remember it forever? -</font>

404
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,000
<font color="yellow">I won't leave you.</font>

405
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,280
<font color="yellow">- How could that be? -</font>

406
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,120
<font color="yellow">- Come a bit closer to me -</font>

407
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,640
<font color="yellow">- So that I can feel you better -</font>

408
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,600
<font color="yellow">- Even the time spent waiting is meaningful -</font>

409
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,000
<font color="yellow">- From the moment you come to me -</font>

410
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
<font color="yellow">I wish this is not a lie.</font>

411
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
<font color="yellow">- Come a step closer -</font>

412
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,280
<font color="yellow">I wish this is sincere.</font>

413
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,880
<font color="yellow">- I can even feel your breath -</font>

414
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,680
<font color="yellow">- My heart is leaning toward you -</font>

415
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:20,240
<font color="yellow">- Bit by bit, bit by bit -</font>

416
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,320
<font color="yellow">- Bit by bit -</font>

417
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,560
<font color="yellow">At this rate, won't Heo Joon Jae die? That's the seventh time.</font>

418
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,120
<font color="yellow">He'll go to the brink of death but won't die. That is the beauty of alcohol.</font>

419
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,240
<font color="yellow">How did you end up drinking with Heo Joon Jae?</font>

420
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,040
<font color="yellow">He said it's important who you learn to drink from.</font>

421
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,480
<font color="yellow">You should have learned frome me!</font>

422
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,040
<font color="yellow">But Heo Joon Jae said this,</font>

423
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right. But the person who Heo Joon Jae learned that from was me. He's my pupil.</font>

424
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,880
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, are things that drunk people say truths or lies?</font>

425
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,480
<font color="yellow">Half and half. In Joon Jae's case,</font>

426
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,480
<font color="yellow">they're all lies. Complete lies.</font>

427
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,160
<font color="yellow">The conversations you have with drunk Joon Jae,</font>

428
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,520
<font color="yellow">consider them as speaking to a puppy. It's all nonsense.</font>

429
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,440
<font color="yellow">Why? What did Joon Jae say?</font>

430
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,000
<font color="yellow">What did Joon Jae say?!</font>

431
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,560
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's move.</font>

432
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,480
<font color="yellow">Oh Baek is back again.</font>

433
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,360
<font color="yellow">This one</font>

434
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,640
<font color="yellow">keeps wagging his tail.</font>

435
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,880
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't that be because he loves his mother so much?</font>

436
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,720
<font color="yellow">No, he's usually really chic like me,</font>

437
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,800
<font color="yellow">and didn't care whether or not people would come and go,</font>

438
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,120
<font color="yellow">but now he was acting hyper and wagging his tail too much.</font>

439
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,000
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if there was something wrong going on mentally.</font>

440
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,880
<font color="yellow">Ah. I'll take him.</font>

441
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,680
<font color="yellow">Does Goo Baek's dad come here nowadays?</font>

442
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,280
<font color="yellow">There he comes.</font>

443
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,480
<font color="yellow">Omo! I haven't seen you in a while!</font>

444
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,840
<font color="yellow">- Hi. How are you?  - I wasn't able to contact you!</font>

445
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I've been quite busy nowadays.</font>

446
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,480
<font color="yellow">Goo Baek became the class president.</font>

447
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,760
<font color="yellow">He's the class president?</font>

448
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, he doesn't bite his friends and has been peeing and pooping in the right areas,</font>

449
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,800
<font color="yellow">so he became the model student, and it seems that the teacher's looked favorably upon him.</font>

450
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,720
<font color="yellow">The mother's of his peers kept saying to treat them to a meal, so I'm here to by organic dog gum.</font>

451
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,440
<font color="yellow">I thought he looked quite well-behaved. You must be happy.</font>

452
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,560
<font color="yellow">He keeps barking whenever he sees dirty or talkative people.</font>

453
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,600
<font color="yellow">He seems to have gained a sense of responsibility after becoming class president.</font>

454
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

455
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,440
<font color="yellow">Were about able to ask him about me?</font>

456
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,280
<font color="yellow">The thing is, I did bring you up,</font>

457
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,080
<font color="yellow">- but I think it'll be a bit difficult.  -Why?</font>

458
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,680
<font color="yellow">His meal schedule is really full.</font>

459
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,320
<font color="yellow">He's actually in Japan right now to have some sushi with his fiancÃÂ©e.</font>

460
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,440
<font color="yellow">Omo! You said he likes home-cooked Korean food! Why is he eating sushi?</font>

461
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,920
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. He receives a lot of requests like this that he must feel uncomfortable.</font>

462
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,840
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm requesting this of you.</font>

463
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,480
<font color="yellow">We really put in a lot of effort to save up this money,</font>

464
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,320
<font color="yellow">so we want to invest it in a reliable place.</font>

465
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,360
<font color="yellow">- Also this...  - What is it?</font>

466
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,440
<font color="yellow">- Just take this one.  - No, no, no.  - Feed Goo Baek with this.</font>

467
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,520
<font color="yellow">This is dog food that someone I know personally made</font>

468
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
<font color="yellow">out of home-grown sweet potatoes and sesame seeds.</font>

469
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,760
<font color="yellow">This is something you can't even buy! It's alright.</font>

470
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,880
<font color="yellow">Just take it. Take it.</font>

471
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,440
<font color="yellow">Aigoo, it's okay.</font>

472
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,680
<font color="yellow">Well then, I'll</font>

473
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,000
<font color="yellow">just be waiting for good news.</font>

474
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,080
<font color="yellow">Unni, I'm telling you, he's a con artist.</font>

475
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,640
<font color="yellow">What con artist would reject me so much?</font>

476
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,240
<font color="yellow">It's a strategy.</font>

477
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,400
<font color="yellow">- Yes?  - When you put in the laundry,</font>

478
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,800
<font color="yellow">could you put outer clothes in this basket and your underclothes in the other?</font>

479
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,760
<font color="yellow">It makes me work a lot extra.</font>

480
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,720
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, that extra work...</font>

481
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,240
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the reason why we have you here?</font>

482
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

483
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,760
<font color="yellow">But if you could just be a little more considerate, my job would be a lot easier.</font>

484
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,240
<font color="yellow">I was going to say this a while ago,</font>

485
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,120
<font color="yellow">but who is the boss here?</font>

486
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,160
<font color="yellow">Are you my mother-in-law?</font>

487
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,720
<font color="yellow">It's like I'm living with my in-laws.</font>

488
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,280
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to be that either.  - What?</font>

489
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,640
<font color="yellow">Unni, are you not going to fire that woman?</font>

490
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,480
<font color="yellow">Even if I fire her, I need to wait until after this dinner happens.</font>

491
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,200
<font color="yellow">I can't before that. You know that ahjumma is an amazing cook.</font>

492
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,680
<font color="yellow">You said that ahjumma has a son, right?</font>

493
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,360
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for the person who will become her daughter-in-law.</font>

494
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,520
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why are they fighting in my house?</font>

495
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,080
<font color="yellow">Why am I the one being considerate?</font>

496
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, Good Baek's father!</font>

497
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,760
<font color="yellow">You were able to arrange his schedule?</font>

498
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,640
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much!</font>

499
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,720
<font color="yellow">So, when is he free?</font>

500
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,520
<font color="yellow">Honey! Honey!</font>

501
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,360
<font color="yellow">Do you think this outfit looks better, or the one before?</font>

502
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,560
<font color="yellow">You did change, right? Is different from before...</font>

503
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,160
<font color="yellow">Nevermind.</font>

504
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,440
<font color="yellow">Ahjumma. Ahjumma!</font>

505
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,920
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

506
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,440
<font color="yellow">Isn't it bright and fitting for Christmas?</font>

507
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

508
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,840
<font color="yellow">It looks bothersome?</font>

509
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,880
<font color="yellow">But, wear what you would like.</font>

510
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,000
<font color="yellow">What about this? It looks active and good.</font>

511
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,480
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it look a little shabby?</font>

512
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,440
<font color="yellow">But just wear whatever you'd like.</font>

513
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,800
<font color="yellow">What do you think of this one?</font>

514
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,920
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

515
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,760
<font color="yellow">It's okay?</font>

516
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's passable.</font>

517
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,120
<font color="yellow">Don't wear a bunch of different accessories with that.</font>

518
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,880
<font color="yellow">It would look good with just one statement piece...</font>

519
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay. I should wear a bracelet.</font>

520
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,280
<font color="yellow">I think a necklace rather than a a bracelet would look better...</font>

521
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,040
<font color="yellow">Necklace?</font>

522
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,280
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you'd like.</font>

523
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,200
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel like I'm doing everything that ahjumma tells me to do?</font>

524
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,000
<font color="yellow">Somehow she doesn't say anything wrong. So annoying.</font>

525
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,720
<font color="yellow">When will he get here?</font>

526
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,520
<font color="yellow">The Dubai guest.</font>

527
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,560
<font color="yellow">Yes, like I said before, it's not like this person</font>

528
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,360
<font color="yellow">doesn't have money. All the companies...</font>

529
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,200
<font color="yellow">The skirt's too short!</font>

530
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,880
<font color="yellow">Wear a long one! One that comes down to here! Go change!</font>

531
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,000
<font color="yellow">So that's why he thinks that eating at home is more important than eating an expensive restaurant.</font>

532
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,360
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I was barely able to arrange this meeting.</font>

533
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,680
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

534
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,480
<font color="yellow">we can't approach him with the mindset that we're giving him money.</font>

535
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,040
<font color="yellow">We need to approach him with our sincerity.</font>

536
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,920
<font color="yellow">But, Si Ah said that</font>

537
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,800
<font color="yellow">they might be con artists. I keep thinking of that...</font>

538
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,920
<font color="yellow">What does your younger sister know? Does she know how the world works?</font>

539
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,560
<font color="yellow">She talks only with those types of people. What would she know?</font>

540
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,440
<font color="yellow">Don't interrogate them. That's so old-fashioned.</font>

541
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,480
<font color="yellow">Don't do it, dear!</font>

542
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,600
<font color="yellow">Why would you cross-check in front of them? You obviously do it behind their backs.</font>

543
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,600
<font color="yellow">Where is Si Ah? Is she not coming?</font>

544
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,160
<font color="yellow">She was at the lab, and she's on her way home.</font>

545
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:20,880
<font color="yellow">BioskopKeren</font>

546
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,440
<font color="yellow">You can't say my name in there.</font>

547
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,800
<font color="yellow">-Heo Joon Jae?  - Don't!</font>

548
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,280
<font color="yellow">I told you last time, my name's Kim Jae Yi.</font>

549
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,000
<font color="yellow">But why do I have to do that?</font>

550
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,120
<font color="yellow">It's just-Just think of it as a business thing! Now shush, I'm gonna ring the bell.</font>

551
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,320
<font color="yellow">I think your guests are here, should I go out and greet them?</font>

552
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,880
<font color="yellow">No! We'll go! Okay?</font>

553
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,320
<font color="yellow">Remember to greet them properly, okay let's go!</font>

554
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,560
<font color="yellow">- Elizabeth! Okay, she's ready, let's go!  - Let's go!</font>

555
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,520
<font color="yellow">- Oh my, hello! Please come in!  - Hello, it's nice to meet you.</font>

556
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,600
<font color="yellow">- It didn't feel right coming empty-handed, so...  - Welcome-! Oh my, thank you!</font>

557
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,280
<font color="yellow">The weather's so cold, isn't it?</font>

558
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,160
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

559
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,200
<font color="yellow">We met before once.</font>

560
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,480
<font color="yellow">You, Yoo Na, and our Elizabeth</font>

561
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,320
<font color="yellow">had a small fight.</font>

562
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,440
<font color="yellow">But we got to see each other again like this!</font>

563
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,800
<font color="yellow">- Elizabeth, give your greetings.  - Hello.</font>

564
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,760
<font color="yellow">Hi. I'll leave Yoo Na in your care. She's my favorite friend.</font>

565
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,640
<font color="yellow">You don't have to go so far as to leave her in her care!</font>

566
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,400
<font color="yellow">I actually firmly disciplined my Elizabeth.</font>

567
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,080
<font color="yellow">"From now on, who's your bff?" Yoo Na.</font>

568
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:02,120
<font color="yellow">I mean, you know what they say, people who become friends while fighting become the best of friends.</font>

569
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,520
<font color="yellow">Didn't they say that? I thought they did...</font>

570
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's so cold. Please go in.</font>

571
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,640
<font color="yellow">It's gotten so cold here, right?</font>

572
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,320
<font color="yellow">I'm Cha Dong Sik.</font>

573
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,240
<font color="yellow">- He's currently under my care during his stay in South Korea, I'm Lee Jong Gwang.  - Oh I see, yes.</font>

574
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,360
<font color="yellow">I'll be giving you the business card of the branch office in Japan, the one I'm most often present at.</font>

575
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,800
<font color="yellow">Oh my, yes...It's nice to meet you.</font>

576
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,640
<font color="yellow">- Yeah Unnie.  - Could you buy some figs on the way here?</font>

577
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,480
<font color="yellow">- The house lady went grocery shopping and forgot to buy that.  - I'm already all the way home though...</font>

578
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,840
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

579
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,640
<font color="yellow">Yes? This is KJ Investment's branch office in Japan, this is CEO Kim Jae Yi's secretary's office.</font>

580
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,480
<font color="yellow">- H-Hello?  - Yes, please speak.</font>

581
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,920
<font color="yellow">Oh, you can speak Korean.</font>

582
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,560
<font color="yellow">Is CEO Kim Jae Yi there right now?</font>

583
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,360
<font color="yellow">Our CEO is currently in South Korea due to personal schedules, what is it you needed?</font>

584
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,360
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing! I'll call back again.</font>

585
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,120
<font color="yellow">Ajumma! It's all done right?! It's all delicious right!</font>

586
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,680
<font color="yellow">I thought the food we usually eat would be best so I did it just the same.</font>

587
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,280
<font color="yellow">You did great! They aren't the crowd to be starving because they're poor</font>

588
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,520
<font color="yellow">that's why the point for today is "care"!</font>

589
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,600
<font color="yellow">No no! I'll bring it out.</font>

590
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,520
<font color="yellow">I wonder, there isn't much value in terms of scarcity there.</font>

591
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,480
<font color="yellow">I think a place like Manhattan, where they can't expand on any buildings or grounds, is better.</font>

592
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,360
<font color="yellow">People often find lands hard to approach but when you look at it from a standard of scarcity value, it becomes clear.</font>

593
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,040
<font color="yellow">The truth is, we have a lot of interest in land too-</font>

594
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,000
<font color="yellow">Let's keep today as a light meal, just for greetings.</font>

595
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,880
<font color="yellow">The detailed issues can be when we've gotten to know each other better.</font>

596
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,040
<font color="yellow">Oh! Of course, I'm always getting ahead of myself.</font>

597
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,440
<font color="yellow">But the two of you are quite the pair! I'm wondering when you're planning to get married?</font>

598
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,520
<font color="yellow">We'll be holding one soon. Around next year, near Dubai or Europe.</font>

599
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,520
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, I see!</font>

600
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,480
<font color="yellow">You're so lucky!</font>

601
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,360
<font color="yellow">Oh right! Please try the spicy steamed flatfish!</font>

602
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,080
<font color="yellow">Oh and this radish salad has raw oysters that came straight from Tong Yeong City this morning!</font>

603
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,400
<font color="yellow">Yes and...</font>

604
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,880
<font color="yellow">Oh, this one! This one has minced fish cake mixed in with some salted pollock roe as seasoning.</font>

605
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,640
<font color="yellow">The recipe's a bit peculiar, but I'm sure it'll be delicious.</font>

606
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,840
<font color="yellow">It really is delicious.</font>

607
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,440
<font color="yellow">Its taste is similar to the ones my mother used to make.</font>

608
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,080
<font color="yellow">Oh my, is that so!? What a relief!</font>

609
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,640
<font color="yellow">Ma'am! Please give us some more egg rolls!</font>

610
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,400
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

611
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,560
<font color="yellow">- Please enjoy.  - Thank you.</font>

612
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,240
<font color="yellow">Huh?! Huh!? Dammit!</font>

613
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,720
<font color="yellow">- Tae Oh?  - Y-Yeah Noona.</font>

614
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

615
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,800
<font color="yellow">- What about you?  - Me? This is my home.</font>

616
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,720
<font color="yellow">Right. I'm here because it's your house too.</font>

617
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,400
<font color="yellow">You came here...knowing this is my home?</font>

618
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,520
<font color="yellow">Yeah...I-I have something to tell you...</font>

619
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,280
<font color="yellow">Oh but I'm not sure I can, I have some guests at home.</font>

620
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,680
<font color="yellow">What. Is it urgent?</font>

621
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,720
<font color="yellow">What is it? I have to get in there right now-</font>

622
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,160
<font color="yellow">I love you!</font>

623
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,200
<font color="yellow">When did it start?</font>

624
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,480
<font color="yellow">Fine, you're right, love isn't something you start like</font>

625
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,040
<font color="yellow">"Okay, I'm gonna start now. Beep!" right?</font>

626
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,320
<font color="yellow">Still, you know exactly what kind of relationship Joon Jae and I have.</font>

627
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,520
<font color="yellow">Just thinking of Joon Jae...</font>

628
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,000
<font color="yellow">How could you love me?</font>

629
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,320
<font color="yellow">You dummy, raise your head.</font>

630
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,040
<font color="yellow">Is love a crime?</font>

631
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,200
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, look at how thin you've become!</font>

632
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,360
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll be able to pull yourself together?</font>

633
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,720
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can go now?</font>

634
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,120
<font color="yellow">What do I do with you?!</font>

635
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,920
<font color="yellow">I only have Joon Jae.</font>

636
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,640
<font color="yellow">This is heartbreaking, seriously.</font>

637
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:02,200
<font color="yellow">I mean, when in the world did your love start growing for me?</font>

638
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,160
<font color="yellow">The truth is, it isn't like I didn't notice it before.  [New Message: To: Nam Du]</font>

639
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,600
<font color="yellow">But why'd it have to be me of all people...  [New Message: Nam Du: Get out right now.]</font>

640
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,080
<font color="yellow">Then again, the only person that's okay around you is probably me.</font>

641
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,920
<font color="yellow">There were times I got the general gist of it.  [To Nam Du: Get out right now. That place is Cha Si Ah's house.]</font>

642
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,200
<font color="yellow">You must be in so much pain, are you okay?</font>

643
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,640
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

644
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,680
<font color="yellow">Get out right now. That place is Cha Si Ah's house</font>

645
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,920
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, sir.</font>

646
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,640
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, an urgent matter has come up, I think we need to leave right away.</font>

647
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,440
<font color="yellow">Oh my, already? Did we make a-a mistake?</font>

648
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,240
<font color="yellow">No, it's n-nothing like that. We'll give you a call later.</font>

649
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,080
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think you can leave like this! We still have so much we need to talk about!</font>

650
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,480
<font color="yellow">Oh my, Representative Kim!</font>

651
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,520
<font color="yellow">Wow. How in the world did that happen?</font>

652
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,040
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying, you should've been thorough with the background check!</font>

653
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,160
<font color="yellow">What the hell is this!? We were so close to getting in trouble!</font>

654
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,800
<font color="yellow">Family registrations don't even show sisters-in-law. How the hell was I supposed to know?! You think I saw things getting screwed up like this?!</font>

655
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, one wrong move and everything would've been busted.</font>

656
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,280
<font color="yellow">What got busted?</font>

657
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,320
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

658
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,280
<font color="yellow">What almost got busted? Why were you close to getting in trouble?</font>

659
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,840
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, are you a con artist? A terrible bastard?</font>

660
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,600
<font color="yellow">I'm also different.</font>

661
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,800
<font color="yellow">If he would know that I'm different, then Heo Joon Jae would probably hate me, right?</font>

662
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,920
<font color="yellow">He will soon leave.</font>

663
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,400
<font color="yellow">If you work, different kinds of things could happen.</font>

664
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you not talking and just staring? It's scary.</font>

665
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,840
<font color="yellow">Was it all a lie?</font>

666
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,880
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm a person who lies.</font>

667
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,120
<font color="yellow">I deceive people and earn money.</font>

668
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,160
<font color="yellow">Right, I'm that kind of person.</font>

669
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,440
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

670
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,560
<font color="yellow">That is my secret.</font>

671
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,320
<font color="yellow">Hey, Heo Joon Jae!  - What is your secret?</font>

672
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,360
<font color="yellow">My secret is...</font>

673
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:11,520
<font color="yellow">that I am different from you. That I am a mermaid.</font>

674
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you having a staring contest and not talking?</font>

675
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's go. Let's rest today.</font>

676
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,240
<font color="yellow">If you know who I am, you will be shocked. You will be hurt and scared.</font>

677
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,800
<font color="yellow">You will leave me, that's why I am trying my very best not to be caught.</font>

678
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:47,120
<font color="yellow">Huh? Cheong, Joon Jae, let's go in. Both of you are really sensitive.</font>

679
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,880
<font color="yellow">Hyung. Just now... did you hear what she just said?</font>

680
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,600
<font color="yellow">What? The one where you almost got caught?</font>

681
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,360
<font color="yellow">The one "why we were almost in trouble?"</font>

682
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,520
<font color="yellow">Not that.</font>

683
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,240
<font color="yellow">Aside from that, what should I hear? You need to talk, what should I hear when you're not opening your mouths and just staring?</font>

684
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:30,520
<font color="yellow">BK</font>

685
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,720
<font color="yellow">My secret is that I am different from you.</font>

686
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,800
<font color="yellow">That I... am a mermaid.</font>

687
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,320
<font color="yellow">I was looking at the painting on the jar</font>

688
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,760
<font color="yellow">and it may sound like crazy talk, but</font>

689
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,080
<font color="yellow">thoughts of that man in the painting being me comes to mind.</font>

690
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,120
<font color="yellow">Where did she go again?</font>

691
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,240
<font color="yellow">Everything is repeating.</font>

692
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
<font color="yellow">My Lord, have you heard about the mermaid?</font>

693
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,080
<font color="yellow">You will be able to see a rare sight.</font>

694
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,440
<font color="yellow">I dream. In that dream, I am living in a strange world.</font>

695
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,000
<font color="yellow">And also, you are there.</font>

696
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,640
<font color="yellow">Look at this. The clothes that the man is wearing.</font>

697
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,320
<font color="yellow">It seems like clothes nowadays. As if it's a painting while looking at the future.</font>

698
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:49,840
<font color="yellow">And on top of that, a mermaid. Isn't it mysterious?</font>

699
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:58,560
<font color="yellow">- If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon -</font>

700
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,720
<font color="yellow">Everything is repeating again. The fate in this place</font>

701
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,520
<font color="yellow">is happening in my dreams. So is such ill-fate.</font>

702
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:14,400
<font color="yellow">In danger, protect that woman.</font>

703
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,280
<font color="yellow">Long time ago, a young lad loved a mermaid.</font>

704
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,040
<font color="yellow">I'm also different.  Heo Joon Jae.</font>

705
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,000
<font color="yellow">If he knew that I'm different</font>

706
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,280
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae would hate me. He would leave.</font>

707
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,600
<font color="yellow">Don't come, Heo Joon Jae!</font>

708
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,560
<font color="yellow">But he didn't know an important thing.</font>

709
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:53,000
<font color="yellow">Mermaids have a special ability.</font>

710
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:00,120
<font color="yellow">Through a kiss, she can erase herself in the memory of a human.</font>

711
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,880
<font color="yellow">That way, the mermaid disappeared like foam in the young lad's memory.</font>

712
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,280
<font color="yellow">- If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon -</font>

713
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,600
<font color="yellow">- If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon -</font>

714
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:23,160
<font color="yellow">- I won't let go of your hand. -</font>

715
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:31,320
<font color="yellow">- I am afraid being under the same sky -</font>

716
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:39,040
<font color="yellow">- together with you will be erased. -</font>

717
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,000
<font color="yellow">- If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon -</font>

718
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,200
<font color="yellow">- If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon -</font>

719
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,720
<font color="yellow">- I won't let go of your hand. -</font>

720
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,440
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

721
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:22,840
<font color="yellow">- Until the last moment of my life -</font>

722
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:29,000
<font color="yellow">- Somewhere and sometime, as I met and -</font>

723
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,520
<font color="yellow">-  loved you. If I see you like someone receding in the distance -</font>

724
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:43,120
<font color="yellow">- Somewhere within me keeps aching -</font>

725
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:49,400
<font color="yellow">- Somewhere sometime  -</font>

726
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:57,080
<font color="yellow">-  we will again grow apart -</font>

727
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:04,080
<font color="yellow">- I am afraid of being forgotten.  -</font>

728
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,400
<font color="yellow">- Even for the moment when I'm holding your hand -</font>
