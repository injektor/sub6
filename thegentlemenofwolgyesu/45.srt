104
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:59,696
<font color="yellow">You agreed to a wedding.</font>

105
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,726
<font color="yellow">I told you, that was out of guilt.</font>

113
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,166
<font color="yellow">We would have never lived happily together...</font>

124
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,266

00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:14,066
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I thought it's Yun Shil but it's Hyo Won.</font>

155
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:16,696
<font color="yellow">Can I take the call outside?</font>

156
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:29,526
<font color="yellow">Hi, Hyo Won. How's your mum?</font>

157
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:30,926
<font color="yellow">Still no change.</font>

158
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:33,766
<font color="yellow">We just got back from the hospital and...</font>

159
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:37,626
<font color="yellow">the doctor said all we can do is help her relax.</font>

160
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,266
<font color="yellow">I hope it doesn't last long.</font>

161
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,626
<font color="yellow">What if she's never able to speak again?</font>

162
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,366
<font color="yellow">What should I do then?</font>

163
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,826
<font color="yellow">That won't ever happen.</font>

164
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:50,426
<font color="yellow">It's temporary, not permanent. Try not to get too worked up.</font>

165
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,466
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

166
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,566
<font color="yellow">Is the wedding over?</font>

167
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,366
<font color="yellow">There was no wedding.</font>

168
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,726
<font color="yellow">There was no wedding? What do you mean?</font>

169
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:03,466
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil disappeared. We're looking for her.</font>

170
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,296
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil disappeared?</font>

171
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:10,096
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the bride was a no-show?</font>

172
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,896
<font color="yellow">Why did she disappear?</font>

173
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,926
<font color="yellow">Does she not want to marry Dong Jin?</font>

174
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:16,666
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

175
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,196
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

176
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,426
<font color="yellow">We're looking for her now. I'll call you back.</font>

177
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,396
<font color="yellow">Okay, bye.</font>

178
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:29,296
<font color="yellow">Ware you talking about my ex-husband?</font>

179
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:33,366
<font color="yellow">Yes. The bride didn't come to the wedding.</font>

180
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,826
<font color="yellow">The bail wasn't a waste.</font>

181
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,526
<font color="yellow">Bail? What do you mean?</font>

182
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,726
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

183
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,026
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

184
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,796
<font color="yellow">You drank until early this morning.</font>

185
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:48,166
<font color="yellow">Is your mum still sick?</font>

186
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,726
<font color="yellow">How do you feel, Mum?</font>

187
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:10,426
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you can't talk?</font>

188
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,396
<font color="yellow">Are you just putting on a show...</font>

189
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,396
<font color="yellow">to force Hyo Won to break up?</font>

190
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,196
<font color="yellow">You're a great actress.</font>

191
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:22,226
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

192
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,826
<font color="yellow">Did you have to say that and upset her all over again?</font>

193
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:28,696
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Mum. Try to relax.</font>

194
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:29,866
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

195
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,296
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Mum.</font>

196
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,966
<font color="yellow">Madam Ko, this came for you.</font>

197
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:44,566
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

198
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,196
<font color="yellow">I went out early this morning...</font>

199
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:50,296
<font color="yellow">to get the milk and newspaper and met Tae Yang.</font>

200
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,426
<font color="yellow">He asked me to give you this.</font>

201
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:58,166
<font color="yellow">He said he couldn't visit because a friend's getting married.</font>

202
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,896
<font color="yellow">I guess he wrote to you.</font>

203
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,566
<font color="yellow">Shall I read it?</font>

204
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:11,196
<font color="yellow">I'm writing this to apologise because I can't visit...</font>

205
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,366
<font color="yellow">as I must attend a friend's wedding.</font>

206
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:16,066
<font color="yellow">How shocked and upset must one be...</font>

207
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,426
<font color="yellow">to lose one's ability to speak?</font>

208
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:23,226
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it makes me feel guilty as if it's my fault.</font>

209
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,296
<font color="yellow">Until you are free of the feeling that I betrayed you,</font>

210
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:30,296
<font color="yellow">I will lie low and repent for what I've done.</font>

211
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,026
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

212
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,896
<font color="yellow">Splash.</font>

213
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:09,096
<font color="yellow">If I must break up with Hyo Won because of this,</font>

214
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,826
<font color="yellow">of course I will be hurt.</font>

215
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,826
<font color="yellow">The thought of not being able to see you again...</font>

216
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,666
<font color="yellow">leaves an empty hole in my heart.</font>

217
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,926
<font color="yellow">The time we spent have become fond and special memories...</font>

218
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,126
<font color="yellow">that I will cherish forever.</font>

219
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:35,926
<font color="yellow">If I have one wish, it is that we can go back to...</font>

220
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:39,426
<font color="yellow">how things were and be happy together.</font>

221
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:46,526
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do understand your concerns.</font>

222
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:50,096
<font color="yellow">I got over my past long ago.</font>

223
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,366
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

224
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:57,066
<font color="yellow">I want to tell you that I dated Hyo Won with a clear conscience.</font>

225
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:01,566
<font color="yellow">"Falling in love with Hyo Won..."</font>

226
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:05,166
<font color="yellow">"made me realise that my previous relationship was more about..."</font>

227
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:09,066
<font color="yellow">"feeling pity for a friend who was there for me..."</font>

228
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,466
<font color="yellow">"during my struggles and not love."</font>

229
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:15,626
<font color="yellow">"I promise to act wisely so as to preserve everyone's happiness."</font>

230
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,826
<font color="yellow">"I hope you will stop being angry."</font>

231
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:20,696
<font color="yellow">"I will visit you tomorrow."</font>

232
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:22,566
<font color="yellow">"Sincerely, Kang Tae Yang."</font>

233
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,926
<font color="yellow">He writes such amazing letters.</font>

234
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:33,566
<font color="yellow">He's never written me a letter yet.</font>

235
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,896
<font color="yellow">You got a love letter from him before I did.</font>

236
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,096
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous.</font>

237
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,696
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

238
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,766
<font color="yellow">(You and Kang Tae Yang)</font>

239
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,496
<font color="yellow">"Can never..."</font>

240
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:55,026
<font color="yellow">You and Kang Tae Yang can never date.</font>

241
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:58,066
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past.</font>

242
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,566
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang and Ji Yun are happy.</font>

243
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,096
<font color="yellow">Nothing will change how we feel about each other.</font>

244
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,926
<font color="yellow">That hurts!</font>

245
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,426
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I'll leave.</font>

246
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,926
<font color="yellow">I knew this kind of thing would happen.</font>

247
00:17:57,926 --> 00:18:00,696
<font color="yellow">That's why I was opposed to Dong Jin and Yun Shil's marriage.</font>

248
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,766
<font color="yellow">What shall I do?</font>

249
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,166
<font color="yellow">I should never approved their marriage...</font>

250
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,396
<font color="yellow">at all costs.</font>

251
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:11,096
<font color="yellow">There's no point to say that.</font>

252
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:13,566
<font color="yellow">This kind of thing happens from the day they get married.</font>

253
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:16,496
<font color="yellow">What would happen after that is very obvious.</font>

254
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,696
<font color="yellow">How can I bear to see my child suffers?</font>

255
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:22,596
<font color="yellow">It's cold, Mum. Why don't we go inside and talk more?</font>

256
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:24,296
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi, you might collapse if you stay here.</font>

257
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:45,596
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that punk did this.</font>

258
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,626
<font color="yellow">That punk...</font>

259
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,096
<font color="yellow">must have kidnapped Yun Shil.</font>

260
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:52,866
<font color="yellow">He's in penitentiary. How can he do such a thing?</font>

261
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,126
<font color="yellow">I heard that Hong Gi Pyo came out of the prison.</font>

262
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:56,796
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

263
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:59,266
<font color="yellow">- Did he get out of the prison? - Yes, he did.</font>

264
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,996
<font color="yellow">Sam Do heard about it from Dong Jin a while ago.</font>

265
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:03,526
<font color="yellow">I was right.</font>

266
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:06,026
<font color="yellow">That guy intended to ruin the wedding.</font>

267
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:08,596
<font color="yellow">That's why he kidnapped Yun Shil.</font>

268
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:13,236
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going, Sun Nyeo? - I need to see Hong Gi Pyo's mum.</font>

269
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:17,196
<font color="yellow">His mum must know where her son is.</font>

270
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,996
<font color="yellow">- I'll push her to get an answer. - I want to go, too.</font>

271
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,066
<font color="yellow">Mum, you're not well. You should stay home.</font>

272
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,736
<font color="yellow">- I'll go with her. - Let's go.</font>

273
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,526
<font color="yellow">The world is so strange</font>

274
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,996
<font color="yellow">We're in a strange world</font>

275
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,296
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

276
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:45,366
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What are you doing?</font>

277
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,796
<font color="yellow">Are you throwing a party?</font>

278
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,096
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're cooking fan cakes.</font>

279
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,626
<font color="yellow">Don't touch. There are for my son.</font>

280
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,236
<font color="yellow">Where's your son?</font>

281
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,026
<font color="yellow">He went out for some business early in the morning.</font>

282
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,826
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for my son?</font>

283
00:19:57,826 --> 00:19:59,126
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee's family is troubled...</font>

284
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:02,126
<font color="yellow">because of your son.</font>

285
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:03,996
<font color="yellow">My brother's wedding was today.</font>

286
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,696
<font color="yellow">However, Yun Shil did not show up at the wedding.</font>

287
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,896
<font color="yellow">So the wedding was cancelled, and it was a mess.</font>

288
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:10,566
<font color="yellow">How can a woman who has a husband get married again?</font>

289
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,236
<font color="yellow">It's not a surprise to me the wedding was cancelled.</font>

290
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:13,566
<font color="yellow">Don't you realise...</font>

291
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:16,896
<font color="yellow">what kind of crime your son committed?</font>

292
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:19,826
<font color="yellow">He kidnapped an innocent person. It's a kidnapping.</font>

293
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:22,266
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? He brought his own wife himself.</font>

294
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,126
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't know much about law...</font>

295
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:26,426
<font color="yellow">as you're an old lady.</font>

296
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,696
<font color="yellow">Have you ever heard of the additional punishment law?</font>

297
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,496
<font color="yellow">- The additional punishment law? - He has a record...</font>

298
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:36,266
<font color="yellow">and it's been just a few days since he was bailed out.</font>

299
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,366
<font color="yellow">He can be subjected to harsher punishment.</font>

300
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,896
<font color="yellow">If we report to the police,</font>

301
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:42,296
<font color="yellow">your son will go to the prison...</font>

302
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:45,666
<font color="yellow">and has to stay there until his hair gets all Gray.</font>

303
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,566
<font color="yellow">- What? - So, contact your son quickly...</font>

304
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:51,526

<font color="yellow">Gi Pyo, where are you? Where are you now, Gi Pyo?</font>

<font color="yellow">(Mum)</font>

307
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,696
<font color="yellow">What shall I do? He left his cell phone at home.</font>

308
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,796
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I wanted to do most at the jail?</font>

309
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,526
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have instant noodle together with you.</font>

310
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:31,126
<font color="yellow">When I first visited your house to receive private loan interest,</font>

311
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:34,236
<font color="yellow">you were eating instant noodle in front of wood-burning stove.</font>

312
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,996
<font color="yellow">It smelled so good. Remember what I said?</font>

313
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,966
<font color="yellow">"If I can get a little of it,"</font>

314
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:43,826
<font color="yellow">"I will deduct 100 dollars of the money I should collect today."</font>

315
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:46,826
<font color="yellow">- Do you remember? - I don't remember that.</font>

316
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,966
<font color="yellow">I erased everything about you in my head.</font>

317
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:52,666
<font color="yellow">How can you forget all those memories?</font>

318
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,596
<font color="yellow">Those things might be memories to you,</font>

319
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,526
<font color="yellow">but they were nightmares to me.</font>

320
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:01,866
<font color="yellow">Nightmares?</font>

321
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,796
<font color="yellow">How could you be changed so much?</font>

322
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:09,296
<font color="yellow">- Who changed you like this? - It's not that I'm changed.</font>

323
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,226
<font color="yellow">I just couldn't say because I was scared back then.</font>

324
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,196
<font color="yellow">Does it mean that you're not scared of me now?</font>

325
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:18,826
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

326
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:22,996
<font color="yellow">Because I have someone I love.</font>

327
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,726
<font color="yellow">Love?</font>

328
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,296
<font color="yellow">How can you say love so easily in front of me?</font>

329
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:38,066
<font color="yellow">I don't know how Lee Dong Jin seduced you.</font>

330
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,096
<font color="yellow">However, you shouldn't say love...</font>

331
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:43,166

334
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,626

335
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,666
<font color="yellow">Family members must be worried.</font>

336
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:01,866
<font color="yellow">Please let me make just one phone call.</font>

337
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:04,366
<font color="yellow">They must be worried now.</font>

338
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,226
<font color="yellow">I should tell them I'm all right.</font>

339

340
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:23,996

00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:25,566
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

357
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:27,896
<font color="yellow">Let me talk to Yun Shil.</font>

358
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,066
<font color="yellow">- I won't do that. - Get Yun Shil on the phone now,</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's talk face to face.</font>

364

<font color="yellow">- Yun Shil is innocent. - Don't you get funny with me.</font>

365

<font color="yellow">Who are you to get in between Yun Shil and me?</font>

366
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:47,296
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

367
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,466
<font color="yellow">- Hong Gi Pyo. - Yun Shil is my girl.</font>

368

<font color="yellow">Why do you interfere when I want to talk to my wife?</font>

369
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:58,566
<font color="yellow">If you don't provoke me,</font>

370
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:01,366
<font color="yellow">I will have a long talk with Yun Shil,</font>

371
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,796

372
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:05,926

373

374
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,166

375
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:13,296
<font color="yellow">you'll never see Yun Shil again.</font>

376
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:20,996
<font color="yellow">What does he say?</font>

377
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:22,666
<font color="yellow">Is he with Yun Shil?</font>

378
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:26,096
<font color="yellow">- Yes, he is. - Why did you hang up, then?</font>

379
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:30,796
<font color="yellow">I installed a location tracking application on Yun Shil's phone.</font>

380

<font color="yellow">- in Anseong. - A vineyard?</font>

385
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:41,866
<font color="yellow">- A vineyard? - A vineyard.</font>

386
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:44,426
<font color="yellow">Hong Gi Pyo's mum works in Anseong.</font>

387
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:46,566

390
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:54,996
<font color="yellow">- Sure we will. - Okay. Let's go.</font>

391
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:57,766
<font color="yellow">I will throw some punches for friendship.</font>

392
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:01,096

394
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,166
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

395
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,466
<font color="yellow">This pork belly is awesome.</font>

396
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:01,266
<font color="yellow">By the way, how long do we have to be on the guard here?</font>

397
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:03,296
<font color="yellow">It's going to be cold after the sun goes down.</font>

398
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,696
<font color="yellow">We should wait until Gi Pyo feels better.</font>

399
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,766
<font color="yellow">Let's finish this.</font>

400
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:11,096
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Cheers.</font>

401
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:14,796
<font color="yellow">Please let me go.</font>

402
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,896
<font color="yellow">Let me go home.</font>

403
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:20,866
<font color="yellow">Just say that you would be with me again.</font>

404
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:23,626
<font color="yellow">Then you can go to Seoul right now.</font>

405
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,866
<font color="yellow">Don't be unreasonable.</font>

406
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,696
<font color="yellow">I won't be with you again.</font>

407
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,566
<font color="yellow">That's the last thing I want.</font>

408
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:42,826
<font color="yellow">I beg of you.</font>

409
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,626
<font color="yellow">Let's leave together.</font>

410
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:50,266
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of being a mobster...</font>

411
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,766
<font color="yellow">and I never felt honourable towards you.</font>

412
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,726
<font color="yellow">I'll wash my hands of it all.</font>

413
00:27:55,826 --> 00:27:57,866
<font color="yellow">Give me one more chance.</font>

00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:38,626
<font color="yellow">Where's Mum?</font>

458
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,026
<font color="yellow">In her room.</font>

459
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:41,466
<font color="yellow">Why are you home?</font>

460
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,196
<font color="yellow">I have an urgent issue to discuss with her.</font>

461
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,066
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm coming in.</font>

462
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:51,826
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

463
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:53,566
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

464
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,426
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

465
00:30:57,066 --> 00:31:00,126
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully to me and try not to be shocked.</font>

466
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:05,766
<font color="yellow">The company's finances are an utter mess, okay?</font>

467
00:31:06,596 --> 00:31:08,096
<font color="yellow">I thought merging the warehouses...</font>

468
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:10,126
<font color="yellow">and selling land would solve it,</font>

469
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:13,766
<font color="yellow">but it didn't because the economy's so slow.</font>

470
00:31:15,596 --> 00:31:18,366
<font color="yellow">I offered the bank my, your and Hyo Won's...</font>

471
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,396
<font color="yellow">shares, land and movable assets...</font>

472
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:23,196
<font color="yellow">as collateral in exchange for...</font>

473
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,296
<font color="yellow">an extension on the loans.</font>

474
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,996
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

475
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:34,826
<font color="yellow">Who said you could do that?</font>

476
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,696
<font color="yellow">Are you insane? Mad?</font>

477
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:39,796
<font color="yellow">Mum. You can speak.</font>

478
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:45,866
<font color="yellow">I can.</font>

479
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,266
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

480
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,396
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Hyo Won.</font>

481
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:53,626
<font color="yellow">It's our secret.</font>

482
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:55,666
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, okay.</font>

483
00:31:58,796 --> 00:32:01,596
<font color="yellow">Are you totally useless at running a company?</font>

484
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:04,026
<font color="yellow">Why did you let things get this bad?</font>

485
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:06,096
<font color="yellow">There's no need to get so upset.</font>

486
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:10,196
<font color="yellow">It's because I spent too much on launching an outdoor line.</font>

487
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,096
<font color="yellow">Once our profits go back up...</font>

488
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:14,566
<font color="yellow">and we sell the land,</font>

489
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,566
<font color="yellow">I'll repay the loans and get our collateral back.</font>

490
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:21,566
<font color="yellow">The bank's just showing off and putting pressure on us.</font>

491
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:27,126
<font color="yellow">Talk to the Legal Team and company lawyers.</font>

492
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,266
<font color="yellow">Don't make the call yourself.</font>

493
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:32,396
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. I already looked into it.</font>

494
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,796
<font color="yellow">It's the final and only option to maintain management.</font>

495
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:38,296
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Mum.</font>

496
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:39,696
<font color="yellow">Don't you trust me?</font>

497
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:41,626
<font color="yellow">Who am I?</font>

498
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,766
<font color="yellow">I'm Min Hyo Sang, your son.</font>

499
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:47,166
<font color="yellow">You have nothing to worry. Leave it to me.</font>

500
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:00,696
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should make up your mind?</font>

501
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,066
<font color="yellow">How do you mean?</font>

502
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:09,066
<font color="yellow">It's your fault that your mum lost the ability to speak.</font>

503
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:12,966
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's time to tell her that...</font>

504
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,526
<font color="yellow">you'll break up with Tae Yang?</font>

505
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,226
<font color="yellow">Your mum will feel much better...</font>

506
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:21,796
<font color="yellow">and she'll be able to speak again.</font>

507
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:24,866
<font color="yellow">Why is it my fault that she can't speak?</font>

508
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:28,566
<font color="yellow">Whose fault is it if it isn't yours?</font>

509
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,296
<font color="yellow">We'd have no problems if you hadn't married Hyo Sang.</font>

510
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:36,426
<font color="yellow">What's done is done.</font>

511
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:39,566
<font color="yellow">Stop being stubborn and do what's right.</font>

512
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:45,266
<font color="yellow">I know it'll be hard...</font>

513
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,996
<font color="yellow">but you should break up with Tae Yang.</font>

514
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,096
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to heal your mum...</font>

515
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,796
<font color="yellow">and set everything right within this household.</font>

516
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:06,266
<font color="yellow">Why did you just laugh?</font>

517
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:09,596
<font color="yellow">You're the root, the core, the beginning of this mess...</font>

518
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:11,596
<font color="yellow">and you're slithering out of it like a mudfish.</font>

519
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,636
<font color="yellow">As of today I'll change your nickname...</font>

520
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,726
<font color="yellow">from Pooper to Mudfish.</font>

521
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:25,526
<font color="yellow">I'm above her in rank. She should pretend to listen.</font>

522
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:27,926
<font color="yellow">She has no manners at all.</font>

523
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,966
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying.</font>

524
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,396
<font color="yellow">The bank president met your brother.</font>

525
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:46,596
<font color="yellow">In exchange for an extension he asked for...</font>

526
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:50,396
<font color="yellow">the majority shareholder's shares, land and movable assets</font>

527
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,266
<font color="yellow">Once the contract is signed,</font>

528
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,266
<font color="yellow">inform Meesa's consortium partners...</font>

529
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:00,636
<font color="yellow">of Meesa Apparel's current financial situation.</font>

530
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:03,396
<font color="yellow">Also leak to the suppliers and construction companies...</font>

531
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,996
<font color="yellow">that they might have difficulty getting paid.</font>

532
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:09,666
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will do that.</font>

533
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,196
<font color="yellow">You messed with me.</font>

534
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,796
<font color="yellow">Now it's my turn.</font>

535
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:39,896
<font color="yellow">Things will get back to normal if only Dong Jin were to come back.</font>

536
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:45,766
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin. Stop playing house...</font>

537
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:49,996
<font color="yellow">and come back to the place where you belong.</font>

538
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:08,866
<font color="yellow">Is this it?</font>

539
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,566
<font color="yellow">Are you sure this is it?</font>

540
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:13,636
<font color="yellow">Yes. This is Gi Pyo's mother's vineyard.</font>

541
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:15,266
<font color="yellow">Where is this rat?</font>

542
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:18,726
<font color="yellow">Don't you smell something?</font>

543
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,596
<font color="yellow">Why does a countryside farm smell so heavenly?</font>

544
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,026
<font color="yellow">It smells like pork belly.</font>

545
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:26,266
<font color="yellow">It is pork belly.</font>

546
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:28,696
<font color="yellow">Let's follow the smell.</font>

547
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:30,726
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

548
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:41,726
<font color="yellow">All that alcohol made me feel sleepy.</font>

549
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,926
<font color="yellow">When do you think they'll be done talking?</font>

550
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,136
<font color="yellow">They're taking longer than I thought.</font>

551
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:48,996
<font color="yellow">Go inside and check.</font>

552
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,566
<font color="yellow">What are we even doing here anyway?</font>

553
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,066
<font color="yellow">Let me have one more shot.</font>

554
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,266
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

555
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:45,966
<font color="yellow">- Who are you? - Us?</font>

556
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:49,296
<font color="yellow">We're the gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop,</font>

557
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:51,396
<font color="yellow">who came to save the abducted bride on her wedding day.</font>

558
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:54,666
<font color="yellow">Where's Yun Shil?</font>

559
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:56,526
<font color="yellow">She's in there, isn't she?</font>

560
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:59,636
<font color="yellow">I thought you looked familiar. You're the tailor shop owner.</font>

561
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:02,566
<font color="yellow">Answer me. Yun Shil is in there, isn't she?</font>

562
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:06,196
<font color="yellow">She and our boss are talking, so don't make a ruckus, and leave.</font>

563
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,396
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

564
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,026
<font color="yellow">- Move. - Hey, hey.</font>

565
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:15,966
<font color="yellow">Step aside while we're being nice.</font>

566
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:17,296
<font color="yellow">- Why you... - What? What?</font>

567
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,926
<font color="yellow">- Look at them. - Forget this.</font>

568
00:38:21,496 --> 00:38:24,496
<font color="yellow">Good. I've been wanting to teach you a lesson anyway.</font>

569
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,866
<font color="yellow">Today must be the day.</font>

570
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,266
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

571
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,866
<font color="yellow">Why you punk...</font>

572
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,496
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

573
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:34,796
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

574
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,366
<font color="yellow">Our boss is... Hey!</font>

575
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:45,266
<font color="yellow">- You punk. - Come on.</font>

576
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:47,866
<font color="yellow">Watch where you put your foot.</font>

577
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:49,996
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

578
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:52,496
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - You punks.</font>

579
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,766
<font color="yellow">That's right. Good job.</font>

580
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:56,766
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

581
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:57,926
<font color="yellow">- Careful. - Darn it.</font>

582
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,166
<font color="yellow">That's it. Good.</font>

583
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:01,296
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

584
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:03,796
<font color="yellow">Careful.</font>

585
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:08,166
<font color="yellow">How dare you steal our boss' wife?</font>

586
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,796
<font color="yellow">It's cold out. Let's stop.</font>

587
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:19,266
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, go inside.</font>

588
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:21,666
<font color="yellow">- Will you be okay? - We'll handle them. Go in.</font>

589
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:25,066
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?</font>

590
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:29,296
<font color="yellow">Don't move. I got him!</font>

591
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:33,166
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Stop it.</font>

592
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:36,066
<font color="yellow">- Dong Jin! - Yun Shil.</font>

593
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,966
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

594
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,196
<font color="yellow">Don't come any closer.</font>

595
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,966
<font color="yellow">Please, be rational, Hong Gi Pyo!</font>

596
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,226
<font color="yellow">Rational?</font>

597
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:50,796
<font color="yellow">How could someone who lost his wife be rational?</font>

598
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,796
<font color="yellow">I wondered...</font>

599
00:39:57,166 --> 00:40:00,666
<font color="yellow">what would be the most fatal way to get revenge on the two of you.</font>

600
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,166
<font color="yellow">I wondered if I should...</font>

601
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,266
<font color="yellow">break your legs and make sure you never walk again...</font>

602
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,766
<font color="yellow">or take Yun Shil somewhere no one would ever find her...</font>

603
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:14,796
<font color="yellow">and separate her from the world,</font>

604
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,666
<font color="yellow">but if I do,</font>

605
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:19,296
<font color="yellow">you two would be that much more desperate for each other.</font>

606

<font color="yellow">(Pesticide)</font>

607
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:31,566
<font color="yellow">Making Yun Shil...</font>

608
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,026
<font color="yellow">live with guilt for the rest of her life.</font>

609
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:39,926
<font color="yellow">Making sure she can never smile again, even if she wants to.</font>

610
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:45,596
<font color="yellow">That's the best revenge.</font>

611
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:48,826
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

612
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:00,366
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

613
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:05,966
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Dong Jin.</font>

614
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:12,166
<font color="yellow">Careful!</font>

615
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,696
<font color="yellow">Don't come closer.</font>

616
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:04,696
<font color="yellow">- What did you do to our boss? - It's okay.</font>

617
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:14,296
<font color="yellow">Who's his guardian? Someone should come with him.</font>

618
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,196
<font color="yellow">I'll go.</font>

619
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,296
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - He's a trauma patient in his 30s.</font>

620
00:42:48,296 --> 00:42:50,926
<font color="yellow">The shelving fell and the items on it fell on him.</font>

621
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:52,066
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

622
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,696
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Excuse me.</font>

623
00:42:55,696 --> 00:42:58,266
<font color="yellow">Can you hear me? Excuse me.</font>

624
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,226
<font color="yellow">- Vitals. - His BP is 100 over 70.</font>

625
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:09,066
<font color="yellow">Set up IV lines and execute a full drop.</font>

626
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:10,136
<font color="yellow">Yes, doctor.</font>

627
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:28,026
<font color="yellow">Are you his guardian?</font>

628
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:29,636
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

629
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:33,226
<font color="yellow">On first appearance, it looks like he's bleeding from the head...</font>

630
00:43:33,226 --> 00:43:35,496
<font color="yellow">and broke a few ribs,</font>

631
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:38,136
<font color="yellow">so we'll need to run some tests.</font>

632
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:40,426
<font color="yellow">We'll start examining him now.</font>

633
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:42,066
<font color="yellow">Is it serious?</font>

634
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:45,496
<font color="yellow">I suspect organ damage due to the external force,</font>

635
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:49,066
<font color="yellow">but I can't say for sure until we run those tests.</font>

636
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:52,426
<font color="yellow">Please push it...</font>

637
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:54,666
<font color="yellow">so that he can get tested soon as a priority.</font>

638
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,796
<font color="yellow">- Please take him. - Yes, doctor.</font>

639
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:12,296
<font color="yellow">He'll be fine. Don't worry.</font>

640
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:25,266
<font color="yellow">So, is he in critical condition?</font>

641
00:44:25,526 --> 00:44:27,666
<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait and see.</font>

642
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,626
<font color="yellow">What a terrible man.</font>

643
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,896
<font color="yellow">How could he do something so hideous and frightening?</font>

644
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:34,496
<font color="yellow">I was in shock, too.</font>

645
00:44:34,496 --> 00:44:36,666
<font color="yellow">I still cringe at the thought.</font>

646
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,366
<font color="yellow">What's Dong Jin doing?</font>

647
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:40,226
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil is in shock,</font>

648
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:42,966
<font color="yellow">so he's trying to calm her down.</font>

649
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,896
<font color="yellow">How could a human being do such a thing?</font>

650
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,296
<font color="yellow">I'm still in shock myself.</font>

651
00:44:48,926 --> 00:44:50,526
<font color="yellow">What is all of this?</font>

652
00:45:04,296 --> 00:45:05,766
<font color="yellow">(Temporarily Closed)</font>

653
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:07,996
<font color="yellow">It's still closed.</font>

654
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:10,126
<font color="yellow">I wonder if something's up.</font>

655
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:12,966
<font color="yellow">Sun Nyeo.</font>

656
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:16,196
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

657
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:18,896
<font color="yellow">You closed the bakery for days. Is something wrong?</font>

658
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:23,026
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law is sick, so I was with her.</font>

659
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:26,566
<font color="yellow">Is she very sick?</font>

660
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:29,696
<font color="yellow">Yes. She has stomach cancer.</font>

661
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:31,666
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

662
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:34,696
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law passed away three years ago,</font>

663
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:36,966
<font color="yellow">so she's been living alone.</font>

664
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:41,096
<font color="yellow">I think I should go down and take care of her.</font>

665
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:43,466
<font color="yellow">What about the bakery?</font>

666
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:46,066
<font color="yellow">A friend will be running it for the time being.</font>

667
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:48,926
<font color="yellow">We just became friends.</font>

668
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:51,266
<font color="yellow">I'm so sad.</font>

669
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:53,226
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

670
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:58,026
<font color="yellow">Poor Sam Do.</font>

671
00:45:58,296 --> 00:46:01,696
<font color="yellow">He'll be sick from a heart ache after losing his first love.</font>

672
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:04,996
<font color="yellow">Stop calling me that.</font>

673
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:06,696
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

674
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:10,766
<font color="yellow">Me? I'd be sad but relieved.</font>

675
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:14,396
<font color="yellow">More relieved or sadder?</font>

676
00:46:15,926 --> 00:46:17,026
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

677
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:21,296
<font color="yellow">I'd say sadness would be 4,</font>

678
00:46:21,596 --> 00:46:22,996
<font color="yellow">and relief would be 6.</font>

679
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:25,296
<font color="yellow">Am I too honest?</font>

680
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,866
<font color="yellow">That's your charm.</font>

681
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:36,626
<font color="yellow">Come over before you leave. Let me cook for you.</font>

682
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:40,566
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

683
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:54,096
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won.</font>

684
00:46:55,066 --> 00:46:56,126
<font color="yellow">Darling.</font>

685
00:47:04,296 --> 00:47:05,796
<font color="yellow">Were you waiting for me?</font>

686
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:16,826
<font color="yellow">You should have called.</font>

687
00:47:17,726 --> 00:47:19,826
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd be too busy.</font>

688
00:47:20,396 --> 00:47:23,096
<font color="yellow">I refrained myself from causing you even more stress.</font>

689
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:24,896
<font color="yellow">Aren't I so nice?</font>

690
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:36,496
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

691
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,826
<font color="yellow">That was considerate of you. I'm impressed.</font>

692
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:50,896
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin must have been really upset.</font>

693
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:53,296
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

694
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:57,496
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin and Yun Shil both look miserable.</font>

695
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:04,196
<font color="yellow">Love is so difficult.</font>

696
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:07,996
<font color="yellow">Yes, indeed.</font>

697
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:17,296
<font color="yellow">You haven't had dinner?</font>

698
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:20,726
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

699
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:28,026
<font color="yellow">I feel like it's all my fault...</font>

700
00:48:29,726 --> 00:48:31,926
<font color="yellow">because Mum's lying in bed and unable to talk.</font>

701
00:48:32,296 --> 00:48:34,296
<font color="yellow">I couldn't possibly eat anything.</font>

702
00:48:43,696 --> 00:48:47,396
<font color="yellow">I told you she'll get better soon. Try to be patient.</font>

703
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:51,496
<font color="yellow">You know how talkative my mother is.</font>

704
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:55,696
<font color="yellow">Seeing someone so talkative with her mouth shut...</font>

705
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:57,626
<font color="yellow">unable to say a word,</font>

706
00:48:58,026 --> 00:49:01,026
<font color="yellow">in a daze as if she's not all there,</font>

707
00:49:04,396 --> 00:49:06,226
<font color="yellow">my heart aches.</font>

708
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:08,596
<font color="yellow">It's so painful.</font>

709
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:30,296
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

710
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:33,366
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to change her mind.</font>

711
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:36,766
<font color="yellow">How is that your fault?</font>

712
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:39,126
<font color="yellow">You've done nothing wrong.</font>

713
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:44,966
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner and then go see your mother.</font>

714
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:48,296
<font color="yellow">If my mother sees you,</font>

715
00:49:48,626 --> 00:49:51,726
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she'll look at you disapprovingly and throw her pillow.</font>

716
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:56,296
<font color="yellow">If that will make her feel better</font>

717
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:59,396
<font color="yellow">and start to speak again, it'll be worth it.</font>

718
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:03,526
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

719
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:32,566
<font color="yellow">Are you actually trying to provoke Mother?</font>

720
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,396
<font color="yellow">How could you bring Kang Tae Yang here again?</font>

721
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,596
<font color="yellow">- You're so selfish. - What did you say?</font>

722
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:39,526
<font color="yellow">Why do you think my mother's sick?</font>

723
00:50:39,526 --> 00:50:40,896
<font color="yellow">Look at you blaming everything on Tae Yang...</font>

724
00:50:40,896 --> 00:50:43,826
<font color="yellow">and acting innocent like you had no part in it.</font>

725
00:50:44,026 --> 00:50:45,196
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

726
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:49,766
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won. That's enough. Let's just go in to see your mother.</font>

727
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:51,596
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

728
00:50:55,926 --> 00:50:58,066
<font color="yellow">So Lawyer Choi, what you're saying is...</font>

729
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:02,166
<font color="yellow">we won't be at risk even if we offer a security, right?</font>

730
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,496
<font color="yellow">It doesn't mean there won't be any risks,</font>

731
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:08,196
<font color="yellow">but I've made sure that management rights be maintained,</font>

732
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:10,226
<font color="yellow">It'll work as a safety device.</font>

733
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:11,366
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

734
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:14,296
<font color="yellow">I saw to it that mortgage set ups be cancelled when the loan is repaid.</font>

735
00:51:14,296 --> 00:51:18,166
<font color="yellow">So we should repay the loan after disposing real estate assets.</font>

736
00:51:19,696 --> 00:51:22,296
<font color="yellow">How on earth did the company end up like this?</font>

737
00:51:37,526 --> 00:51:38,766
<font color="yellow">I've come to see you, Mother.</font>

738
00:51:43,426 --> 00:51:45,296
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that, Mum.</font>

739
00:51:45,296 --> 00:51:47,696
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang brought some roasted chestnuts for you.</font>

740
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:50,096
<font color="yellow">Try some while they're still warm.</font>

741
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,596
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Mum?</font>

742
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,296
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

743
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:01,626
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Calm down.</font>

744
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:12,966
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What's going on?</font>

745
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,426
<font color="yellow">Mother needs absolute rest,</font>

746
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:20,226
<font color="yellow">so both of you leave this instant.</font>

747
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,466
<font color="yellow">Quickly.</font>

748
00:52:24,796 --> 00:52:26,466
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang. Let's leave for now.</font>

749
00:52:27,296 --> 00:52:30,026
<font color="yellow">I'll return at a better time. I hope you can get some rest.</font>

750
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,826
<font color="yellow">If you tell them not to come,</font>

751
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:47,166
<font color="yellow">they should obey your order.</font>

752
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:49,226
<font color="yellow">Are they trying to be rebellious?</font>

753
00:52:49,226 --> 00:52:51,926
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what their intention is by coming every day.</font>

754
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:54,996
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Hyo Sang to tell them not to come,</font>

755
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:58,426
<font color="yellow">so don't get too upset and have your herbal medicine.</font>

756
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:01,126
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

757
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:04,196
<font color="yellow">What was that for, Mother?</font>

758
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,026
<font color="yellow">You want me to leave as well?</font>

759
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:14,826
<font color="yellow">All right, all right. I'm leaving.</font>

760
00:53:24,296 --> 00:53:26,466
<font color="yellow">I should have accepted Tae Yang as my son-in-law...</font>

761
00:53:26,966 --> 00:53:29,626
<font color="yellow">rather than letting that cunning girl join our family.</font>

762
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:31,626
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

<font color="yellow">She didn't run away. She was kidnapped.</font>

776
00:54:37,426 --> 00:54:41,026
<font color="yellow">She was kidnapped before she got to the wedding so it was cancelled.</font>

777

779
00:54:47,396 --> 00:54:51,466

785
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:14,896

786
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:17,296
<font color="yellow">How inconsiderate.</font>
