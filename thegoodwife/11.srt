63
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,900

<font color="yellow">You did some research on the antidepressant, right?</font>

158
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,930
<font color="yellow">Yes. Lawyer Lee and I studied some dissertations...</font>

159
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,000
<font color="yellow">and interviewed some doctors.</font>

160
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,300

164

<font color="yellow">You should read it over.</font>

165

<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

166
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,860

169
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, she wants you to be the second chair.</font>

174
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,930
<font color="yellow">I don't have enough experience.</font>

175
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,530
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll be all right in a civil participation trial?</font>

176

<font color="yellow">I shouldn't let my parents go just like that.</font>

209

<font color="yellow">if this is the right thing to do.</font>

211

<font color="yellow">Also, my husband...</font>

230
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,760
<font color="yellow">is supporting me the most more than anyone else.</font>

231
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,000
<font color="yellow">The plaintiff lowered the compensation money...</font>

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
<font color="yellow">and asked for the ban of Elvatil.</font>

233
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,230
<font color="yellow">Is this a strategy to make the pharmaceutical company settle?</font>

234
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

235
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,460
<font color="yellow">It's to show that the plaintiff is not doing this for money.</font>

236
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,430
<font color="yellow">This lawsuit is for the honour of those who died or got injured...</font>

237
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,030
<font color="yellow">due to Elvatil's side effects, and also to prevent future deaths.</font>

238
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,300
<font color="yellow">If the pharmaceutical company admits to the side effects...</font>

239
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,200
<font color="yellow">and apologise with a prevention plan for the future,</font>

240
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,730
<font color="yellow">we might consider settling.</font>

241
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,900
<font color="yellow">Our opponent hired the best lawyer in civil participation trials.</font>

242
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,800
<font color="yellow">Yes. I heard from Lawyer Seo Joong Won.</font>

243
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,030
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

244
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,830
<font color="yellow">I want you to lead the arraignment.</font>

245
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,530
<font color="yellow">Me? I've never talked in front of the jury...</font>

246
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,670
<font color="yellow">I chose you myself.</font>

247
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,600
<font color="yellow">Don't doubt yourself.</font>

248
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,900
<font color="yellow">I know you can do it, and you'll do well.</font>

249
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,130
<font color="yellow">I still think that you're better...</font>

250
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,230
<font color="yellow">Of course I'll be better than you.</font>

251
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,800
<font color="yellow">I prepared it for a long time and I know this case the best.</font>

252
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,430
<font color="yellow">However, this is a civil participation trial where...</font>

253
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,960
<font color="yellow">the lawyer's charms will influence the outcome.</font>

254
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,860
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking you.</font>

255
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,400
<font color="yellow">I trust your abilities and I want to use you.</font>

256
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,860
<font color="yellow">A lawyer must use every means to get a win for his or her client.</font>

257
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,760
<font color="yellow">It could be someone's image, their looks...</font>

258
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,330
<font color="yellow">or their talent with words.</font>

259
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,130
<font color="yellow">As the law firm's president, I believe you're perfect for this.</font>

260
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,760
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll try my best.</font>

261
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,760
<font color="yellow">You'll be great.</font>

262
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,700
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the restroom for a minute.</font>

<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming.</font>

307
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,030
<font color="yellow">My name is...</font>

308
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,100
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Son Dong Wook.</font>

309
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,830
<font color="yellow">Before I talk about the trial,</font>

310
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,230
<font color="yellow">I'd like to explain my condition.</font>

311
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,300
<font color="yellow">Hello, Lawyer Kim Hye Gyeong.</font>

312
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,130
<font color="yellow">You were a little late, so we decided that I start.</font>

313
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
<font color="yellow">I see. Okay.</font>

314
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,130
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

315
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,300
<font color="yellow">- As I've mentioned before, - I'm sorry.</font>

316
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,200
<font color="yellow">-I'd like to talk... - Where were you?</font>

317
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,560
<font color="yellow">I had to see someone outside.</font>

318
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,230
<font color="yellow">I have what's called tardive dyskinesias.</font>

319
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,730
<font color="yellow">I can't control all of my muscles,</font>

320
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,360
<font color="yellow">so I keep moving like this.</font>

321
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,130
<font color="yellow">Sometimes when I'm happy, I do this.</font>

322
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,200
<font color="yellow">It's okay to laugh.</font>

323
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,760
<font color="yellow">In Korea, there's a huge distance between normal and disabled people.</font>

324
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,530
<font color="yellow">Many aren't sure how to act when they see someone who's disabled.</font>

325
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,760
<font color="yellow">By the time this trial is over,</font>

326
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,760
<font color="yellow">I hope that the gap between you and me...</font>

327
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
<font color="yellow">will get smaller.</font>

328
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,600
<font color="yellow">The great news...</font>

329
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
<font color="yellow">is...</font>

330
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,130
<font color="yellow">this medicine.</font>

331
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,030
<font color="yellow">I take this medicine once every few hours every day.</font>

332
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,830
<font color="yellow">This medicine doesn't get rid of my symptoms completely,</font>

333
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,230
<font color="yellow">but it reduces them greatly.</font>

334
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,100
<font color="yellow">My condition is rare,</font>

335
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,400
<font color="yellow">so selling this medicine won't bring enough revenue.</font>

336
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,400
<font color="yellow">The company that made this medicine...</font>

337
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
<font color="yellow">despite significant financial losses...</font>

338
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,060
<font color="yellow">is also the manufacturer of antidepressant Elvatil,</font>

339
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,030
<font color="yellow">whom you'll judge today.</font>

340
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,060
<font color="yellow">Objection, Your Honour.</font>

341
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,330
<font color="yellow">Objection dismissed.</font>

342
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,930
<font color="yellow">I must tell you that...</font>

343
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,660
<font color="yellow">my symptoms get worse when I get flustered.</font>

344
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,230
<font color="yellow">That's why I can neither tell lies...</font>

345
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,760
<font color="yellow">nor hear other people lie.</font>

346
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,100
<font color="yellow">Objection, Your Honour.</font>

347
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,460
<font color="yellow">Both parties, come this way.</font>

348
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,430
<font color="yellow">Your Honour.</font>

349
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,400
<font color="yellow">While explaining his condition, the lawyer of the defendant...</font>

350
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
<font color="yellow">is trying to make the defendant look positive to the jurors.</font>

351
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,430
<font color="yellow">Your Honour, I only explained my condition beforehand in case...</font>

352
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,130
<font color="yellow">I surprise the jurors.</font>

353
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,300
<font color="yellow">The issue of the trial is whether the antidepressant manufactured...</font>

354
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,230
<font color="yellow">by the defendant causes violence and suicidal urges.</font>

355
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,330
<font color="yellow">The lawyer of the defendant shouldn't compliment the company...</font>

356
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,360
<font color="yellow">while pretending to explain his condition.</font>

357
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,730
<font color="yellow">What you're saying is also reasonable.</font>

358
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,900
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Son.</font>

359
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,130
<font color="yellow">It's okay to explain your condition,</font>

360
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,700
<font color="yellow">but don't relate it to the pharmaceutical company.</font>

361
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,430
<font color="yellow">All right, Your Honour.</font>

362
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

363
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,060
<font color="yellow">it's a demonstrative trial where citizens participate.</font>

364
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,800
<font color="yellow">The Supreme Court is also watching us.</font>

365
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,430
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

366
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,230
<font color="yellow">try not to be irrational.</font>

367
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,930
<font color="yellow">Let's just follow the rules,</font>

368
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,430
<font color="yellow">all right?</font>

369
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,500
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best...</font>

370
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,500
<font color="yellow">as long as the defendant doesn't do anything funny.</font>

371
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,800
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

372
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,030
<font color="yellow">You must be happy that your husband's so famous.</font>

373
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,660
<font color="yellow">Your bag wasn't by the vending machine.</font>

374
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I forgot that my colleague had it.</font>

375
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,760
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can win the case by playing games like this?</font>

376
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,030
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

377
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,000
<font color="yellow">You're already upset.</font>

378
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,990
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim, did the trial go well?</font>

379
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,630
<font color="yellow">Your mother is waiting for you in the office.</font>

380
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,330
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mother.</font>

381
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,560
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

382
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

383
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,590
<font color="yellow">You abandoned my son.</font>

384
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,260
<font color="yellow">Tae Joon was alone in the apartment.</font>

385
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,860
<font color="yellow">As soon as he was released,</font>

386
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,860
<font color="yellow">he got kicked out of his house and went to a strange, new place.</font>

387
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

388
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,060
<font color="yellow">Did you decide to break up with him...</font>

389
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,730
<font color="yellow">after he was released?</font>

390
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,660
<font color="yellow">I went through all the difficulties and broke up after he got released.</font>

391
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,690
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I did that?</font>

392
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,890
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing another man?</font>

393
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,430
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

394
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,090
<font color="yellow">I can't understand you.</font>

395
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,260
<font color="yellow">I told Tae Joon...</font>

396
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,390
<font color="yellow">that you're scary because you don't share your thoughts.</font>

397
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,760
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you...</font>

398
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,190
<font color="yellow">why I'm doing this?</font>

399
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,190
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

400
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,190
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Fine.</font>

401
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,760
<font color="yellow">Let's say you break up.</font>

402
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,130
<font color="yellow">Whatever the reason may be,</font>

403
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,360
<font color="yellow">I can't stop you if you want it.</font>

404
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,930
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

405
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,960
<font color="yellow">what will you do about your children?</font>

406
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,890
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon and Seo Yeon...</font>

407
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,060
<font color="yellow">are excited to live happily with their father again.</font>

408
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,330
<font color="yellow">What will you tell them?</font>

409
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,660
<font color="yellow">Will you tell them honestly?</font>

410
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,060
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

411
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,590
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them myself.</font>

412
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,860
<font color="yellow">They'll understand since they're grown up.</font>

413
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,830
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel,</font>

414
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,430
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

415
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
<font color="yellow">things won't work out...</font>

416
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,530
<font color="yellow">as well as you'd like.</font>

417
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,260
<font color="yellow">I won't see you off.</font>

418
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,730
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

419
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,260
<font color="yellow">How can we let him return to the prosecutors' office?</font>

420
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,560
<font color="yellow">Even if he was tried innocent for bribery,</font>

421
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,590
<font color="yellow">how can we let him return when the whole nation knows of his video?</font>

422
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,260
<font color="yellow">We don't hire womanisers a prosecutors.</font>

423
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,530
<font color="yellow">No, I'm sorry.</font>

424
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,590
<font color="yellow">I should have won the case. But Sir, this is...</font>

425
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,430
<font color="yellow">We're already here.</font>

426
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,990
<font color="yellow">Okay. Take your time.</font>

427
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,660
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

428
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,260
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Just find out who that woman is.</font>

429
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,160
<font color="yellow">The disciplinary committee will think otherwise when we reveal her.</font>

430
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,430
<font color="yellow">The district attorney will be here soon.</font>

431
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,860
<font color="yellow">He told me to go ahead without him.</font>

432
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,890
<font color="yellow">Sang Il,</font>

433
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,190
<font color="yellow">let's end it here.</font>

434
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,630
<font color="yellow">It's not good to show the public that we're fighting internally.</font>

435
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,130
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Do Sub?</font>

436
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,690
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

437
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,190
<font color="yellow">Families shouldn't fight.</font>

438
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,360
<font color="yellow">Even if we reinvestigate Dream UCT's case,</font>

439
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,160
<font color="yellow">I won't touch a hair on you.</font>

440
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,430
<font color="yellow">I don't plan on hurting your family either.</font>

441
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,030
<font color="yellow">I'll let you keep working at the prosecutors' office.</font>

442
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,430
<font color="yellow">All I'm asking is for you to just sit still.</font>

443
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,160
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything.</font>

444
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,460
<font color="yellow">You know, your superiors feel pressured by you.</font>

445
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,990
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

446
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,560
<font color="yellow">Well? Did you talk it out?</font>

447
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,230
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's so understanding.</font>

448
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,130
<font color="yellow">Thank you,</font>

449
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,830
<font color="yellow">Sang Il.</font>

450
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,960
<font color="yellow">I decided to take some time away from your dad.</font>

451
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,460
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

452
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,830
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

453
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
<font color="yellow">Because that's the best for now.</font>

454
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,630
<font color="yellow">I can't understand it.</font>

455
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,360
<font color="yellow">I thought everything was sorted out.</font>

456
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,890
<font color="yellow">He won the case and everything.</font>

457
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,230
<font color="yellow">You said you'd try again with Dad.</font>

458
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

459
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,360
<font color="yellow">I tried, but it didn't work out.</font>

460
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,130
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

461
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,330
<font color="yellow">Are you two going to break up forever?</font>

462
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,230
<font color="yellow">It's not like that. We're just taking some time to think.</font>

463
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,590
<font color="yellow">Nothing has been decided yet.</font>

464
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,660
<font color="yellow">Then before you make a decision,</font>

465
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,260
<font color="yellow">are we banned from seeing him?</font>

466
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,860
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

467
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,460
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens between us,</font>

468
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,090
<font color="yellow">you two are still our children.</font>

469
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,330
<font color="yellow">I understand it's hard...</font>

470
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,390
<font color="yellow">but there wasn't anything else I could do.</font>

471
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,930
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

472
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,730
<font color="yellow">let's keep this between ourselves.</font>

473
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,460
<font color="yellow">Because it could harm Dad?</font>

474
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,730
<font color="yellow">Because it could put all of us in a difficult position.</font>

475
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,830
<font color="yellow">You're saying that you might get together with Dad again, right?</font>

476
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,760
<font color="yellow">Is that why we're keeping it a secret?</font>

477
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,630
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, there are a lot of people that like to talk about others.</font>

478
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,690
<font color="yellow">They want other people to be ruined.</font>

479
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,160
<font color="yellow">They add false information before spreading rumours.</font>

480
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
<font color="yellow">There's nothing good in people like that...

481
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,190
<font color="yellow">knowing about us.</font>

482
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,830
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever you tell us to do.</font>

483
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,930
<font color="yellow">I know how hard it has been for you.</font>

484
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,990
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

485
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,960
<font color="yellow">just want you to be happy.</font>

486
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,360
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

487
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,360
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry to you both.</font>

488
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,560
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. Come in. - Mother.</font>

489
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,260
<font color="yellow">- Did you drink? - Mother.</font>

490
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,030
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - My goodness.</font>

491
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,530
<font color="yellow">You reek.</font>

492
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,730
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - How much did you drink?</font>

493
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,330
<font color="yellow">Hey, watch it. You'll trip.</font>

494
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,230
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

495
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,390
<font color="yellow">- I had a few drinks. - All right.</font>

496
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,430
<font color="yellow">I met up with my colleagues.</font>

497
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,930
<font color="yellow">I'm going to put them all in jail.</font>

498
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,260
<font color="yellow">Okay, go ahead. I don't know who they are but go ahead.</font>

499
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,530
<font color="yellow">Stay still. Let me make you some honey water.</font>

500
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,460
<font color="yellow">- Sit down for a minute. - Mother.</font>

501
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,760
<font color="yellow">All right. What's with you?</font>

502
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,230
<font color="yellow">- My mother. - Okay, okay.</font>

503
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,030
<font color="yellow">Gosh. My goodness.</font>

504
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,760
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

505
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,990
<font color="yellow">How much did he drink?</font>

506
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,260
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness I brought some food for him to eat.</font>

507
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,130
<font color="yellow">Did you see Hye Gyeong on television today?</font>

508
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,790
<font color="yellow">She was acting as if you guys were doing fine.</font>

509
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,090
<font color="yellow">She was smiling so much.</font>

510
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,190
<font color="yellow">I know she does it deliberately.</font>

511
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,930
<font color="yellow">You need to wake up and watch out.</font>

512
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,490
<font color="yellow">Make sure she doesn't do anything strange.</font>

513
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,090
<font color="yellow">You have to set things straight.</font>

514
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,030
<font color="yellow">What did Lee Tae Joon say about your involvement in this case?</font>

515
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,630
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to just do my best in this case.</font>

516
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,860
<font color="yellow">Also, my husband...</font>

517
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,690
<font color="yellow">is supporting me the most more than anyone else.</font>

518
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,730
<font color="yellow">The plaintiff lowered the compensation money...</font>

519
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,860
<font color="yellow">Also, my husband...</font>

520
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,690
<font color="yellow">is supporting me the most more than anyone else.</font>

521
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,530
<font color="yellow">Also, my husband...</font>

522
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,460
<font color="yellow">is supporting me the most more than anyone else.</font>

523
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,360
<font color="yellow">Also, my husband...</font>

524
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,160
<font color="yellow">is supporting me the most more than anyone else.</font>

525
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,160
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kim Sae Young.</font>

526
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,630
<font color="yellow">In a recent clinical demonstration,</font>

527
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,260
<font color="yellow">you found out that the patients who took Elvatil were...</font>

528
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,330
<font color="yellow">three times more...</font>

529
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,260
<font color="yellow">My apologies. It was because of my condition.</font>

530
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,960
<font color="yellow">Three times more...</font>

531
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,430
<font color="yellow">Three times more...</font>

532
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,960
<font color="yellow">They were three times more likely to commit suicide.</font>

533
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,100
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's correct.</font>

534
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,390
<font color="yellow">The serotonin transporter gene...</font>

535
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,990
<font color="yellow">known as 5-HTT...</font>

536
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,790
<font color="yellow">must have increased the synaptic serotonin levels.</font>

537
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,660
<font color="yellow">Could you explain in words that are simpler to understand?</font>

538
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,430
<font color="yellow">Imagine a train station.</font>

539
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,190
<font color="yellow">The neurotransmitter serotonin...</font>

540
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,830
<font color="yellow">is like the train engineer.</font>

541
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,490
<font color="yellow">The rail tracks can be seen as the absorption rate.</font>

542
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,930
<font color="yellow">Then the gene 5-HTT...</font>

543
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,630
<font color="yellow">can be seen as coal. That would be easier to understand.</font>

544
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,690
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

545
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,930
<font color="yellow">No further questions.</font>

546
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,160
<font color="yellow">The defence counsel may now ask questions.</font>

547
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Honour.</font>

548
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,860
<font color="yellow">Doctor. Let's talk about sex.</font>

549
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,100
<font color="yellow">What? Talk about what?</font>

550
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,660
<font color="yellow">What was that substance called? Sel...</font>

551
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,560
<font color="yellow">Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, right?</font>

552
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,630
<font color="yellow">Anyway, that substance has an influence on people's...</font>

553
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,260
<font color="yellow">sexual behaviours and emotions, doesn't it?</font>

554
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,260
<font color="yellow">Yes. It does, but...</font>

555
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,790
<font color="yellow">But it would only amplify one's feelings.</font>

556
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,730
<font color="yellow">It cannot create feelings one never had, am I right?</font>

557
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,790
<font color="yellow">If someone commits murder from this substance's influence,</font>

558
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,690
<font color="yellow">that means that the person originally had hatred inside.</font>

559
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,490
<font color="yellow">How are the jurors reacting?</font>

560
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,490
<font color="yellow">They think the way you talk is too hard.</font>

561
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,100
<font color="yellow">They like the male lawyer because he's nice and easy to understand.</font>

562
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,260
<font color="yellow">They say that a company working to find cure for a rare disease...</font>

563
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,260
<font color="yellow">would never harm their patients.</font>

564
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,160
<font color="yellow">When recess is over, Ms Do has to testify right away.</font>

565
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,860
<font color="yellow">Is she ready?</font>

566
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, she'll be fine.</font>

567
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,660
<font color="yellow">We have to turn the tables over now.</font>

568
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,330
<font color="yellow">We might end up losing.</font>

569
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,490
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

570
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,460
<font color="yellow">Our family used to be so happy.</font>

571
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,830
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one left now.</font>

572
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,960
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the compensation money.</font>

573
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,630
<font color="yellow">I just don't want them to sell Elvatil any more.</font>

574
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,460
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

575
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,530
<font color="yellow">Please help us so that there won't be any more victims like us.</font>

576
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,600
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

577
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,390
<font color="yellow">No further questions.</font>

578
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,390
<font color="yellow">The defence counsel may now ask questions.</font>

579
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,390
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Honour.</font>

580
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,730
<font color="yellow">First, I'd like to pay respects to your late parents.</font>

581
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,260
<font color="yellow">Did your father work in an interior design company?</font>

582
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,790
<font color="yellow">Yes. He designed wallpapers and lights.</font>

583
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,860
<font color="yellow">Were all of his colleagues females?</font>

584
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,160
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about that.</font>

585
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,260
<font color="yellow">Then I'll tell you.</font>

586
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,530
<font color="yellow">He worked with 11 women.</font>

587
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,030
<font color="yellow">He used to work late a lot, right?</font>

588
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,990
<font color="yellow">He was late time to time, but...</font>

589
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,190
<font color="yellow">I'd like to submit this as evidence.</font>

590
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,230
<font color="yellow">The police found this bag when they arrived at the site.</font>

591
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,330
<font color="yellow">Is it your father's?</font>

592
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,890
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

593
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,260
<font color="yellow">This is a list of items inside the bag.</font>

594
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,190
<font color="yellow">Please read out loud the third item.</font>

595
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,330
<font color="yellow">I'll read it out loud instead.</font>

596
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,730
<font color="yellow">"A woman's black underwear".</font>

597
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,930
<font color="yellow">"Small size".</font>

598
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,600
<font color="yellow">I'll ask the witness.</font>

599
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,260
<font color="yellow">What is your mother's size?</font>

600
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,930
<font color="yellow">Objection, Your Honour. The question is irrelevant to the case.</font>

601
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,390
<font color="yellow">To prove what happened to Do Jae Cheol and his wife...</font>

602
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,130
<font color="yellow">isn't related to the side effects of the medicine, it's important to ask.</font>

603
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,230
<font color="yellow">Objection dismissed. The witness should answer.</font>

604
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,860
<font color="yellow">I believe her size is 77.</font>

605
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,600
<font color="yellow">Then it wouldn't be small size.</font>

606
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,330
<font color="yellow">Even if Elvatil causes side effects, not that it does,</font>

607
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,560
<font color="yellow">but if it does,</font>

608
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,890
<font color="yellow">it can't create feelings that don't exist.</font>

609
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,100
<font color="yellow">If her father killed his wife and committed suicide,</font>

610
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,860
<font color="yellow">isn't it because they had mistrust...</font>

611
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,160
<font color="yellow">between the two?</font>

612
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,030
<font color="yellow">That isn't true. My dad...</font>

613
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,490
<font color="yellow">My father wasn't someone who'd do that.</font>

614
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,530
<font color="yellow">They had no problems.</font>

615
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,100
<font color="yellow">Problems of a married couple stay between them.</font>

616
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,890
<font color="yellow">If he were that happy,</font>

617
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,160
<font color="yellow">why did he take antidepressants?</font>

618
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,490
<font color="yellow">Why was a pair of woman's underwear found in his bag?</font>

619
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,990
<font color="yellow">Objection, Your Honour.</font>

620
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,990
<font color="yellow">That'll be all.</font>

621
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,790
<font color="yellow">Members of the jury, do you have any questions?</font>

622
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,690
<font color="yellow">Witness, you may step down.</font>

623
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,460
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Son.</font>

624
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,190
<font color="yellow">Wasn't that too harsh even though winning the case is a priority?</font>

625
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,860
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

626
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,390
<font color="yellow">How could you say that to Han Na when she lost both of her parents?</font>

627
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,530
<font color="yellow">Do you really believe in what you say...</font>

628
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,730
<font color="yellow">or are you doing this for the money?</font>

629
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,860
<font color="yellow">You're only wasting time if you're trying to see...</font>

630
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,260
<font color="yellow">if I'm conscientious.</font>

631
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,060
<font color="yellow">Right, you don't seem conscientious.</font>

632
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,030
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim, let me give you an advice.</font>

633
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,130
<font color="yellow">You can't win solely based on good intentions.</font>

634
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,160
<font color="yellow">You need skills.</font>

635
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,060
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

636
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,060
<font color="yellow">I really want to win this case.</font>

637
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,790
<font color="yellow">We should. We'll win this case no matter what.</font>

638
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,230
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

639
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,960
<font color="yellow">your new office?</font>

640
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,790
<font color="yellow">I'll be hired officially after the meeting with disciplinary committee.</font>

641
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,100
<font color="yellow">But they told me to prepare for the investigation on Dream UCT here.</font>

642
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,890
<font color="yellow">Higher management ordered them, so they gave me a spot,</font>

643
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,830
<font color="yellow">but they don't want me to be noticeable.</font>

644
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,660
<font color="yellow">I've been a prosecutor for a long time,</font>

645
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,690
<font color="yellow">but I've never been here.</font>

646
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,330
<font color="yellow">From now on, you'll only sit...</font>

647
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,100
<font color="yellow">in a much better office than this.</font>

648
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,030
<font color="yellow">At the appointment today,</font>

649
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,600
<font color="yellow">will Lawyer Kim join?</font>

650
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,260
<font color="yellow">Congresswoman Lee wants her there.</font>

651
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,190
<font color="yellow">Let's meet without her today.</font>

652
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,130
<font color="yellow">She's busy with a trial.</font>

653
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,790
<font color="yellow">Did the trial go well?</font>

654
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,860
<font color="yellow">No, we need to talk.</font>

655
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,360
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

656
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,230
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped because medicine is boring.</font>

657
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,990
<font color="yellow">It's true though.</font>

658
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,730
<font color="yellow">That truth is boring.</font>

659
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,030
<font color="yellow">The defendant is making it dramatic...</font>

660
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,790
<font color="yellow">while we talk about boring things, so who would listen to us?</font>

661
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,530
<font color="yellow">That's why we're discussing this, to change our strategy.</font>

662
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,860
<font color="yellow">My strategy is a little aggressive.</font>

663
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
<font color="yellow">As you know,</font>

664
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,960
<font color="yellow">the first civil procedure where citizens participate can get messy.</font>

665
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,260
<font color="yellow">I know your strategy,</font>

666
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,190
<font color="yellow">but what else can we do when the defendant's side is acting that way?</font>

667
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,730
<font color="yellow">We need an aggressive strategy.</font>

668
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's been unfair to many.</font>

669
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,260
<font color="yellow">We must win this case for them.</font>

670
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,790
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's review the case together.</font>

671
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,590
<font color="yellow">What's the name of our witness in medicine?</font>

672
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,260
<font color="yellow">Pardon me,</font>

673
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,460
<font color="yellow">but what do you want me to say?</font>

674
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,430
<font color="yellow">I reviewed the dissertation you wrote.</font>

675
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,590
<font color="yellow">It said taking Elvatil reduces one's libido.</font>

676
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,960
<font color="yellow">I don't think it does.</font>

677
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,930
<font color="yellow">It was part of the results in your research.</font>

678
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,390
<font color="yellow">Patient 18...</font>

679
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,260
<font color="yellow">said so during an interview at the clinical test.</font>

680
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,530
<font color="yellow">That's more likely due to another factor.</font>

681
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,990
<font color="yellow">Therefore, we moved on to the next topic.</font>

682
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,560
<font color="yellow">Doctor, you know about the side effects of Elvatil...</font>

683
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,760
<font color="yellow">better than anyone else.</font>

684
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,190
<font color="yellow">For the victims to receive...</font>

685
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:32,030
<font color="yellow">an apology and compensation from the pharmaceutical company,</font>

686
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,060
<font color="yellow">this is the only way.</font>

687
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,830
<font color="yellow">I'm a scientist.</font>

688
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,790
<font color="yellow">I can't lie just because you want me to.</font>

689
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,660
<font color="yellow">All right, Doctor Kim.</font>

690
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,590
<font color="yellow">But as you only fulfilled half of the contract's requirement,</font>

691
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,490
<font color="yellow">you'll have to return half of the payment.</font>

692
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,160
<font color="yellow">I'll review...</font>

693
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,760
<font color="yellow">the research results.</font>

694
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

695
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,960
<font color="yellow">Do you have any recordings of animal testing?</font>

696
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,830
<font color="yellow">I need the most violent one.</font>

697
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,360
<font color="yellow">What kind of influence did an overdose of trytophane...</font>

698
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,960
<font color="yellow">have on the test subjects?</font>

699
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,090
<font color="yellow">Their libido was reduced.</font>

700
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,390
<font color="yellow">Objection, Your Honour.</font>

701
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,560
<font color="yellow">It's irrelevant to the case.</font>

702
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,460
<font color="yellow">The defendant's argument...</font>

703
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,990
<font color="yellow">is based on the fact that Do Jae Cheol, who took...</font>

704
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,030
<font color="yellow">the medicine, did what he did as he had an affair.</font>

705
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,390
<font color="yellow">By showing that Elvatil reduces one's libido,</font>

706
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,860
<font color="yellow">we'll prove that Do Jae Cheol couldn't have an affair.</font>

707
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,890
<font color="yellow">Objection dismissed. Please proceed.</font>

708
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,530
<font color="yellow">Is the reduction of libido permanent when Elvatil is taken?</font>

709
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,490
<font color="yellow">Further research is necessary,</font>

710
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,260
<font color="yellow">but it is possible.</font>

711
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,330
<font color="yellow">This is what happens when...</font>

712
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,530
<font color="yellow">a minimum amount of Elvatil is injected into white mice.</font>

713
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,590
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

714
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,330
<font color="yellow">Among cells that produce dopamine,</font>

715
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,830
<font color="yellow">we wanted to find out the influence of 5-HT2C.</font>

716
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,790
<font color="yellow">This happened as a result.</font>

717
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,830
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

718
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,890
<font color="yellow">All the mice died except for one.</font>

719
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,630
<font color="yellow">That's all, Your Honour.</font>

720
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,660
<font color="yellow">Members of the jury, do you have any questions?</font>

721
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,830
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

722
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,760
<font color="yellow">"Are there other medicines that use ingredients in Elvatil?"</font>

723
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,830
<font color="yellow">"My libido has diminished recently."</font>

724
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,630
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

725
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,660
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - Yes?</font>

726
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,890
<font color="yellow">Questions irrelevant to the trial are not allowed.</font>

727
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,730
<font color="yellow">Skills are more important than conscience, right?</font>

728
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,790
<font color="yellow">Were we too harsh?</font>

729
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,920
<font color="yellow">No, you were completely appropriate.</font>

730
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,120
<font color="yellow">There are already articles on it.</font>

731
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,490
<font color="yellow">"Antidepressant Elvatil reduces sexual desires."</font>

732
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,120
<font color="yellow">MRG's shares will drop by tomorrow.</font>

733
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,990
<font color="yellow">Now, I understand...</font>

734
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,420
<font color="yellow">what you meant...</font>

735
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,390
<font color="yellow">during the Lee Eun Joo case.</font>

736
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,390
<font color="yellow">We have to protect our clients, not our beliefs.</font>

737
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,990
<font color="yellow">Back then, I thought it would be fine as long as I was proud.</font>

738
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,790
<font color="yellow">Even if I lost,</font>

739
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,650
<font color="yellow">I tried my best and it just couldn't be helped.</font>

740
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,650
<font color="yellow">Maybe I thought of it too simply.</font>

741
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,250
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

742
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,450
<font color="yellow">I only said that because I was afraid we wouldn't get paid.</font>

743
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,050
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

744
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,290
<font color="yellow">it ended up the way you thought.</font>

745
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,820
<font color="yellow">Eun Joo got her apology.</font>

746
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,550
<font color="yellow">You did well then.</font>

747
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,950
<font color="yellow">I was lucky.</font>

748
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,350
<font color="yellow">I got Tae Joon's help.</font>

749
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,790
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong.</font>

750
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,990
<font color="yellow">I don't regret it.</font>

751
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,990
<font color="yellow">I still have hope.</font>

752
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,790
<font color="yellow">Hope that I'll be able to protect my client as well as my beliefs.</font>

753
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,220
<font color="yellow">When I build more experience...</font>

754
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,890
<font color="yellow">and become a veteran, wouldn't I be able to do it?</font>

755
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,120
<font color="yellow">Not now, though.</font>

756
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,390
<font color="yellow">That's why I want to win a lot.</font>

757
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,290
<font color="yellow">For the clients...</font>

758
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,550
<font color="yellow">and for myself as well.</font>

759
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,590
<font color="yellow">Then again,</font>

760
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,120
<font color="yellow">even during a mock court,</font>

761
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,250
<font color="yellow">you would never give up even when everyone else did...</font>

762
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,650
<font color="yellow">and got extenuation.</font>

763
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,420
<font color="yellow">The trial wouldn't finish even at 1am when it started at 2pm.</font>

764
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,290
<font color="yellow">All of the kids were dozing off.</font>

765
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,990
<font color="yellow">The professor said that...</font>

766
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,690
<font color="yellow">you lost legalistically,</font>

767
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,120
<font color="yellow">but gave you the win in order to finish the trial.</font>

768
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was like that back then too.</font>

769
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,220
<font color="yellow">I can be stubborn.</font>

770
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,690
<font color="yellow">Do you remember that your opposing prosecutor...</font>

771
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,450
<font color="yellow">was me?</font>

772
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:42,850
<font color="yellow">Was it you?</font>

773
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,350
<font color="yellow">Yes. Whenever I said something,</font>

774
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,650
<font color="yellow">you would scream in objection.</font>

775
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,890
<font color="yellow">Towards the end, I would just flinch at the thought...</font>

776
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,920
<font color="yellow">of you getting up.</font>

777
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,320
<font color="yellow">The professor called me over...</font>

778
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,220
<font color="yellow">and told me not to become a prosecutor.</font>

779
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,690
<font color="yellow">That's how bad it was.</font>

780
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,020
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about back then.</font>

781
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,090
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

782
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,020
<font color="yellow">While watching you that day,</font>

783
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,450
<font color="yellow">I was really amazed.</font>

784
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:13,890
<font color="yellow">If you ever find out...</font>

785
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,420
<font color="yellow">anything in life,</font>

786
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,020
<font color="yellow">please share with me.</font>

787
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,750
<font color="yellow">It'll likely help with my life as a lawyer.</font>

788
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,590
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

789
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,250
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you whatever I find out.</font>

790
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,450
<font color="yellow">We're all here. Please go ahead.</font>

791
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,820
<font color="yellow">I think we both understand where we stand through the trial.</font>

792
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,290
<font color="yellow">Why don't we come to an agreement now?</font>

793
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
<font color="yellow">An agreement?</font>

794
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,950
<font color="yellow">The trial is far from being over.</font>

795
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,750
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

796
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're listening.</font>

797
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,450
<font color="yellow">It's better for your side to settle as well.</font>

798
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,920
<font color="yellow">You won't get much from winning the trial.</font>

799
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,690
<font color="yellow">Let's talk in person tomorrow.</font>

800
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,720
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a call after discussing with the other lawyers.</font>

801
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,990
<font color="yellow">We did it.</font>

802
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,390
<font color="yellow">I'm happy, but it's a little strange.</font>

803
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,220
<font color="yellow">They looked like they wanted to go all the way yesterday.</font>

804
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,990
<font color="yellow">Lawyers are great bluffers.</font>

805
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,320
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to Do Han Na.</font>

806
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:34,890
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong.</font>

807
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,620
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have dinner together?</font>

808
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,220
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

809
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,020
<font color="yellow">Are you Lawyer Kim Hye Gyeong?</font>

810
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:55,790
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

811
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,220
<font color="yellow">I'm Song Hui Su.</font>

812
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,290
<font color="yellow">Hello. Are you waiting for someone?</font>

813
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,690
<font color="yellow">Yes. Joong Won.</font>

814
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,450
<font color="yellow">Right. He's in his office. Should I tell him you're here?</font>

815
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,120
<font color="yellow">That's okay, I can wait here.</font>

816
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,790
<font color="yellow">I heard you went to school with him.</font>

817
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:13,850
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

818
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,450
<font color="yellow">We're institute colleagues, too.</font>

819
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,120
<font color="yellow">He talks about you all the time.</font>

820
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,390
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous.</font>

821
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,120
<font color="yellow">That's because we're good friends.</font>

822
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,090
<font color="yellow">To be honest, today is our first date.</font>

823
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,750
<font color="yellow">I guess that's why I'm jealous.</font>

824
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,590
<font color="yellow">Right, dinner plans.</font>

825
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,850
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong, this is Song Hui Su.</font>

826
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,720
<font color="yellow">She's a student at the school I gave a lecture once.</font>

827
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,120
<font color="yellow">I forgot we were going for dinner.</font>

828
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,620
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come with us?</font>

829
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,350
<font color="yellow">No, that's okay. I don't want to bother you.</font>

830
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,820
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of work to do anyway.</font>

831
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,390
<font color="yellow">Right. Your husband was released, right?</font>

832
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,490
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations. - Thank you.</font>

833
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:52,850
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your dinner.</font>

834
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

835
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,550
<font color="yellow">Are you free tonight?</font>

836
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,590
<font color="yellow">We are supposed to have drinks after every first jury trial.</font>

837
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:45,790
<font color="yellow">We keep on missing it.</font>

838
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,050
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim.</font>

839
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,190
<font color="yellow">Kim Ji Young.</font>

840
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,050
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

841
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,790
<font color="yellow">We have to continue working at the same office.</font>

842
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,890
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it was necessary to tell you.</font>

843
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,690
<font color="yellow">- It was such a long time ago... - It's selfish to make an excuse.</font>

844
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,850
<font color="yellow">If you step into politics,</font>

845
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,190
<font color="yellow">you lose interest in women.</font>

846
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,050
<font color="yellow">Politics is so much more fun.</font>

847
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:29,850
<font color="yellow">It excites you and you get addicted to it.</font>

848
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's incomparable to women.</font>

849
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,650
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to have a better relationship with your wife.</font>

850
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,550
<font color="yellow">You two will become partners more so than a husband and a wife.</font>

851
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,890
<font color="yellow">You should tell her that.</font>

852
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,120
<font color="yellow">I prefer being a husband and a wife than being partners.</font>

853
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,120
<font color="yellow">I prefer that as well since that's less complicated.</font>

854
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,650
<font color="yellow">Anyway, good luck with your investigation.</font>

855
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,350
<font color="yellow">Please send your wife my greetings.</font>

856
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,520
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

857
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,950
<font color="yellow">Did you know about the problem between my wife and me as well?</font>

858
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,550
<font color="yellow">Yes. I had some assumptions.</font>

859
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,020
<font color="yellow">I think the congresswoman has an idea as well.</font>

860
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,390
<font color="yellow">It would be best to sort it out in one way or another.</font>

861
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,120
<font color="yellow">This is not a matter to sort out.</font>

862
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,290
<font color="yellow">She's my wife...</font>

863
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,020
<font color="yellow">and it's my life.</font>

864
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,190
<font color="yellow">It's not something other people should get involved in.</font>

865
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,990
<font color="yellow">Tell this to Congresswoman Lee.</font>

866
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,450
<font color="yellow">If I don't have any value to her,</font>

867
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,990
<font color="yellow">she should just give me up.</font>

868
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,190
<font color="yellow">If I must make up or break up, it's up to me.</font>

869
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,850
<font color="yellow">I won't move...</font>

870
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,890
<font color="yellow">according to your plans.</font>

871
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,520
<font color="yellow">I think Lawyer Kim Hye Gyeong...</font>

872
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,450
<font color="yellow">is a nice person.</font>

873
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,250
<font color="yellow">She's a talented lawyer.</font>

874
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,120
<font color="yellow">What's the relationship between you two?</font>

875
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,250
<font color="yellow">Not what the rumours say. What's the truth?</font>

876
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,650
<font color="yellow">(Hello.)</font>

877
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,490
<font color="yellow">(It's been a while.)</font>

878
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:20,890
<font color="yellow">(He's never been here before so we need a few more minutes.)</font>

879
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,050
<font color="yellow">(Yes, no problem.)</font>

880
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,090
<font color="yellow">(Who is he?)</font>

881
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,090
<font color="yellow">(Are you friends?)</font>

882
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,420
<font color="yellow">(Or is he your boyfriend?)</font>

883
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,120
<font color="yellow">(I'm not sure yet.)</font>

884
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,690
<font color="yellow">(Right now, I'm interested in him.)</font>

885
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,190
<font color="yellow">(Well, best of luck.)</font>

886
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,790
<font color="yellow">(If you need anything, just let me know.)</font>

887
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,090
<font color="yellow">(Thank you.)</font>

888
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,320
<font color="yellow">He says you're handsome.</font>

889
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:49,690
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

890
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,250
<font color="yellow">It won't be decided tomorrow. We have to adjust the terms.</font>

891
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,220
<font color="yellow">However, the company would want to avoid their shares from dropping.</font>

892
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,250
<font color="yellow">So it won't take too long.</font>

893
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,820
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

894
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,890
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know if anything confirms.</font>

895
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:10,190
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

896
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,250
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Long time no see.</font>

897
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,320
<font color="yellow">Do you come here often? It looks expensive here.</font>

898
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,490
<font color="yellow">I sometimes come here with my dad.</font>

899
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,520
<font color="yellow">Your dad must be someone famous.</font>

900
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,850
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you if you promise you won't be shocked.</font>

901
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,690
<font color="yellow">If you say that, I feel like I have to be shocked.</font>

902
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,920
<font color="yellow">He owns Calim Financial which rents buildings.</font>

903
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,690
<font color="yellow">Calim Financial?</font>

904
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,950
<font color="yellow">Didn't it rank fourth place in real estate industry?</font>

905
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,190
<font color="yellow">It ranked third.</font>

906
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,450
<font color="yellow">Not that it's important.</font>

907
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,320
<font color="yellow">You're buying dinner tonight, right?</font>

908
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

909
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,620
<font color="yellow">Most people get quiet when they find out what my father does.</font>

910
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,820
<font color="yellow">That's not your case.</font>

911
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,820
<font color="yellow">It's because they're too scared.</font>

912
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,350
<font color="yellow">How do you say, "What's the most expensive wine here,"</font>

913
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,990
<font color="yellow">in Spanish?</font>

914
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,220
<font color="yellow">Can we talk?</font>

915
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,250
<font color="yellow">Weren't we done talking?</font>

916
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,050
<font color="yellow">We need to talk more.</font>

917
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,720
<font color="yellow">That's what married couples do.</font>

918
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,420
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

919
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,090
<font color="yellow">What more do I have to hear?</font>

920
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,520
<font color="yellow">I found a good marriage counsellor.</font>

921
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,650
<font color="yellow">The counsellor has a lot of experience in marital issues.</font>

922
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,820
<font color="yellow">I'll go see the counsellor starting next week.</font>

923
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,550
<font color="yellow">And? Do I have to go, too?</font>

924
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

925
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:57,090
<font color="yellow">We must understand each other for us to reconcile soon.</font>

926
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,420
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it. You should go before our children arrive.</font>

927
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,450
<font color="yellow">Hye Gyeong.</font>

928
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,950
<font color="yellow">I said I'm sorry. I know you're angry.</font>

929
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,650
<font color="yellow">I know you don't want to talk to me right now,</font>

930
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,920
<font color="yellow">but we can't continue like this.</font>

931
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,720
<font color="yellow">Right now...</font>

932
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,290
<font color="yellow">is the most important time for us.</font>

933
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,720
<font color="yellow">Many have high hopes for us.</font>

934
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,420
<font color="yellow">If we only get through this,</font>

935
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,920
<font color="yellow">I can be in a position where...</font>

936
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,850
<font color="yellow">I can change the nation.</font>

937
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,290
<font color="yellow">I never wanted that.</font>

938
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,620
<font color="yellow">What I wanted...</font>

939
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,190
<font color="yellow">was for you to be a good person.</font>

940
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,750
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

941
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,250
<font color="yellow">I've changed a lot because of you.</font>

942
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,520
<font color="yellow">That's why I got rid of Cho Guk Hyun.</font>

943
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

944
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,120
<font color="yellow">You haven't changed since that accident.</font>

945
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,850
<font color="yellow">I believed you then.</font>

946
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,890
<font color="yellow">I believed you were standing up for justice.</font>

947
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,450
<font color="yellow">Even after giving up...</font>

948
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,890
<font color="yellow">my experience and my future,</font>

949
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:08,350
<font color="yellow">I thought I could be together with you.</font>

950
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,750
<font color="yellow">I know why you're angry with me.</font>

951
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,250
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

952
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
<font color="yellow">I accept it.</font>

953
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:20,890
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

954
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,690
<font color="yellow">it's not the right time to get angry.</font>

955
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,890
<font color="yellow">For now, please do what I ask you.</font>

956
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,120
<font color="yellow">You must think...</font>

957
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,550
<font color="yellow">I'll forgive you again.</font>

958
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:37,920
<font color="yellow">We're married.</font>

959
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,820
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

960
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,720
<font color="yellow">Seo Yeon.</font>

961
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,690
<font color="yellow">We can't separate.</font>

962
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,390
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

963
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,290
<font color="yellow">You think I'll come back to you as long as...</font>

964
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,850
<font color="yellow">you beg for forgiveness no matter what you do.</font>

965
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,650
<font color="yellow">The Kim Hye Gyeong...</font>

966
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,050
<font color="yellow">in your head is someone who took the blame for your mistake.</font>

967
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,990
<font color="yellow">She thought that was love for 15 years.</font>

968
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,490
<font color="yellow">You think I'll keep being that way as I've been that way until now.</font>

969
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,090
<font color="yellow">I understand now...</font>

970
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,250
<font color="yellow">what kind of person you thought I was.</font>

971
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,120
<font color="yellow">But I'm sorry.</font>

972
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,690
<font color="yellow">To me, I'm more valuable than you are.</font>

973
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,090
<font color="yellow">- Hye Gyeong. - Please leave.</font>

974
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,020
<font color="yellow">Are you the good one and the only one who's hurt?</font>

975
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,720
<font color="yellow">Is it all my fault?</font>

976
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,590
<font color="yellow">You've lived with me for 15 years.</font>

977
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,250
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend that you're the victim and the only good person.</font>

978
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,550
<font color="yellow">Both you and I are the same.</font>

979
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,090
<font color="yellow">That's why we stayed together.</font>

980
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,520
<font color="yellow">Then tell me.</font>

981
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,720
<font color="yellow">Tell you what?</font>

982
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,690
<font color="yellow">You said I pretended to be the victim,</font>

983
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:44,950
<font color="yellow">but what about you?</font>

984
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:48,850
<font color="yellow">You said you loved me so tell me what you've done for me.</font>

985
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,690
<font color="yellow">Have you ever...</font>

986
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,620
<font color="yellow">asked what I really wanted?</font>

987
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,090
<font color="yellow">Have you ever been curious?</font>

988
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,090
<font color="yellow">You always said what you wanted to say.</font>

989
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,820
<font color="yellow">"I need you," "I'm sorry". Did you say those things for me?</font>

990
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,620
<font color="yellow">Have you ever put me before you?</font>

991
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,020
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to say?</font>

992
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,720
<font color="yellow">Say what will make me believe you...</font>

993
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,950
<font color="yellow">so our relationship can be recovered.</font>

994
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:29,950
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

995
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,450
<font color="yellow">What about Seo Joong Won?</font>

996
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,350
<font color="yellow">Is he any different?</font>

997
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,620
<font color="yellow">Should I compliment on how he's still a great colleague...</font>

998
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,850
<font color="yellow">as he was before? Is that what you want?</font>

999
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,890
<font color="yellow">You changed your mind because you met someone else.</font>

1000
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,850
<font color="yellow">All you want is that I leave you. Fine, I'll leave.</font>

1001
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,090
<font color="yellow">Do you want to take it all the way?</font>

1002
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,820
<font color="yellow">I only made a mistake once, but you...</font>

1003
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,850
<font color="yellow">fell in love with him.</font>

1004
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,220
<font color="yellow">Between you and me,</font>

1005
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,450
<font color="yellow">whose the worse one?</font>

1006
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,920
<font color="yellow">Is that what you've been thinking...</font>

1007
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,990
<font color="yellow">while apologising to me?</font>

1008
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,650
<font color="yellow">Were you wondering why I was taking so long to forgive you?</font>

1009
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,690
<font color="yellow">My apologies were sincere.</font>

1010
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,790
<font color="yellow">You were the one who didn't believe me.</font>

1011
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,020
<font color="yellow">Right, you're always sincere.</font>

1012
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,590
<font color="yellow">I'm the bad one if I don't forgive you.</font>

1013
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,790
<font color="yellow">I have to believe you whenever you want me to...</font>

1014
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,390
<font color="yellow">and ignore when you do wrong.</font>

1015
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,190
<font color="yellow">I can be a good wife only if I always stay by your side.</font>

1016
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:41,390
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what you want from me?</font>

1017
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,390
<font color="yellow">We're too riled up.</font>

1018
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,790
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later, Hye Gyeong.</font>

1019
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not riled up.</font>

1020
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,550
<font color="yellow">I can see most clearly now ever since I've met you.</font>

1021
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,490
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

1022
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,350
<font color="yellow">(The Good Wife)</font>

1023
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,990
<font color="yellow">I want to follow my heart from now on.</font>

1024
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,020
<font color="yellow">You must push it forward...</font>

1025
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,190
<font color="yellow">or postpone it as much as possible. It's one of the two.</font>

1026
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,250
<font color="yellow">Tae Joon will raise the children. You don't have any right.</font>

1027
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:50,850
<font color="yellow">Is there something?</font>

1028
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,550
<font color="yellow">It's somewhat illegal.</font>

1029
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,750
<font color="yellow">Let's just do our work and talk only about work.</font>

1030
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,320
<font color="yellow">There won't be any turning back.</font>

1031
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,990
<font color="yellow">I'm good at punishing people who have done wrong.</font>

1032
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:01,650
<font color="yellow">What kind of rule is that?</font>

1033
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,820
<font color="yellow">I found your name during Dream UCT investigation.</font>

1034
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,820
<font color="yellow">Did you look for my name on purpose?</font>
