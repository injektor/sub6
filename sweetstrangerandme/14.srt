00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:16,668
<font color="yellow">You should have learned something by now...</font>

158
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:19,238
<font color="yellow">after both your sons have turned their back on you.</font>

159
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,238
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

160
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,468
<font color="yellow">- Arrest them! - What is going on?</font>

161
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:37,498
<font color="yellow">Let me go!</font>

162
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,668
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

163
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,768
<font color="yellow">Do you really think this is the end?</font>

164
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:49,668
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure I find you wherever you hide.</font>

165
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:53,598
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

166
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,398
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim Wan Shik, come with me.</font>

167
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,038
<font color="yellow">How did you spend your time in prison?</font>

168
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:10,168
<font color="yellow">I earned two brothers...</font>

169
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:12,138
<font color="yellow">and learned how to make dumplings.</font>

170
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,238
<font color="yellow">You and those dumplings.</font>

171
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,638
<font color="yellow">Where you here all night?</font>

172
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,538
<font color="yellow">At least, you didn't get hurt this time.</font>

173
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,468
<font color="yellow">I meant to tell you before leaving,</font>

174
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:07,138
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't.</font>

175
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,768
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't tell you since I didn't want to worry you.</font>

176
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,298
<font color="yellow">A normal girl would have called and asked.</font>

177
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,568
<font color="yellow">But I didn't.</font>

178
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:18,298
<font color="yellow">I was worried it would put you in more danger.</font>

179
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,438
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised I was even thinking of it.</font>

180
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,268
<font color="yellow">You said things were okay.</font>

181
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:26,298
<font color="yellow">Do you know what came to my mind?</font>

182
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:29,338
<font color="yellow">"What if you get hurt again when you're still healing?"</font>

183
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,538
<font color="yellow">"He might even get himself killed this time"</font>

184
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:33,268
<font color="yellow">Everything's settled now. I promise you.</font>

185
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,068
<font color="yellow">Wan Shik turned himself in and Mr. Bae got arrested.</font>

186
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,568
<font color="yellow">It's all done now.</font>

187
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,498
<font color="yellow">Do you really expect me to believe you?</font>

188
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,498
<font color="yellow">You want me to believe you and let it slide?</font>

189
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,238
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do anymore.</font>

190
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:52,968
<font color="yellow">I was thinking where we should go for our first trip.</font>

191
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:54,798
<font color="yellow">Now that's what I consider normal.</font>

192
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:24,008
<font color="yellow">Where's your daughter?</font>

193
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:25,938
<font color="yellow">No, I mean your girlfriend.</font>

194
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:30,068
<font color="yellow">I mean the second CEO. Isn't she eating breakfast?</font>

195
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:32,738
<font color="yellow">Eat quietly. She stayed up all night.</font>

196
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:40,068
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat! Don't slack off!</font>

197
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,568
<font color="yellow">Good morning!</font>

198
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,238
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! Omelets for breakfast!</font>

199
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,038
<font color="yellow">Have a seat. I'll hurry up and make you one.</font>

200
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,168
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your breakfast and have a great day.</font>

201
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:58,638
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat.</font>

202
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:05,598
<font color="yellow">She's angry at me, but I don't know what to do.</font>

203
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,068
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Why am I asking you this?</font>

204
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,068
<font color="yellow">We wouldn't know, but this might help.</font>

205
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,008
<font color="yellow">"I made a mistake."</font>

206
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:19,268
<font color="yellow">"My girlfriend is mad at me."</font>

207
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,668
<font color="yellow">"What should I do?"</font>

208
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,938
<font color="yellow">Let's see what we have here.</font>

209
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:25,668
<font color="yellow">Look. He's not the only one who's suffering.</font>

210
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:28,538
<font color="yellow">Guys with the same concern gave solutions.</font>

211
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,038
<font color="yellow">It says, "Give her a hug and apologize."</font>

212
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:40,768
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry</font>

213
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:47,338
<font color="yellow">No, she might slap you.</font>

214
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,468
<font color="yellow">Let's try finding another one.</font>

215
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,638
<font color="yellow">How about trying to be funny and acting charming?</font>

216
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,868
<font color="yellow">- Charm? - Act charming?</font>

217
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,008
<font color="yellow">Act charming...</font>

218
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,568
<font color="yellow">- No. - I tried picturing it.</font>

219
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:10,938
<font color="yellow">I don't think this will work either.</font>

220
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,198
<font color="yellow">If you get this wrong, you might get slapped twice.</font>

221
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,398
<font color="yellow">This is it. This is the answer.</font>

222
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,738
<font color="yellow">"Just listen to what she has to say."</font>

223
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,938
<font color="yellow">Good luck!</font>

224
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,898
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, say it.</font>

225
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:51,398
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that? You're scaring me.</font>

226
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:53,968
<font color="yellow">Did you tell Hong Na Ri and Ko Nan Gil...</font>

227
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:57,568
<font color="yellow">how the property got on fire?</font>

228
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,768
<font color="yellow">They're doing everything to protect that property.</font>

229
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:04,068
<font color="yellow">I think it's right that you tell them what happened.</font>

230
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,738
<font color="yellow">- Well... - If you can't,</font>

231
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,198
<font color="yellow">should I tell them?</font>

232
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:16,868
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kwon, I'm going to let Na Ri keep the land.</font>

233
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,068
<font color="yellow">The family has been eager to build a resort there.</font>

234
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:21,868
<font color="yellow">Do you think your father will let you do that?</font>

235
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:23,598
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make sure it happens.</font>

236
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:27,838
<font color="yellow">But the accident will remain as secret to them both.</font>

237
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:31,398
<font color="yellow">Being my father's son,</font>

238
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,068
<font color="yellow">I'm naturally neither honest nor righteous.</font>

239
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:38,868
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kwon,</font>

240
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,508
<font color="yellow">have some pity on me.</font>

241
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:44,038
<font color="yellow">I really have feelings for Na Ri.</font>

242
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:48,368
<font color="yellow">It doesn't harm to hide shame from someone you like.</font>

243
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:51,508
<font color="yellow">My friends' lives were taken for no reason,</font>

244
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,008
<font color="yellow">but all you feel is a bit of shame?</font>

245
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:10,268
<font color="yellow">I'm calling to confirm your leave of absence meeting.</font>

246
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:11,938
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm available then.</font>

247
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:15,368
<font color="yellow">I'll see you then. Thank you for the call.</font>

248
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:27,198
<font color="yellow">Say if you want to say something. I'm here to listen.</font>

249
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:28,298
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything to say.</font>

250
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,438
<font color="yellow">Did you eat breakfast?</font>

251
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,538
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

252
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:43,698
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'll wait until you do it.</font>

253
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:49,838
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, do you remember saying that you were happy...</font>

254
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,138
<font color="yellow">when we went on biking together?</font>

255
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:54,068
<font color="yellow">How do you feel these days? Are you happy living here?</font>

256
00:21:58,738 --> 00:21:59,738
<font color="yellow">Go and do your work.</font>

257
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,838
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll be able to work?</font>

258
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:05,438
<font color="yellow">I told you to go!</font>

259
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:15,068
<font color="yellow">Hi, Neighborhood Friend!</font>

260
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:22,438
<font color="yellow">(Hong Dumplings Menu)</font>

261
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:29,068
<font color="yellow">I can see it didn't go well by looking at your face.</font>

262
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:34,338
<font color="yellow">The second CEO indeed has a temper, right?</font>

263
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:41,468
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

264
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:54,798
<font color="yellow">You're the most pitiful person in the world.</font>

265
00:22:58,798 --> 00:22:59,898
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

266
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:02,138
<font color="yellow">Good. How about you, Duk Bong?</font>

267
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:04,838
<font color="yellow">Not too well. Things couldn't be worse.</font>

268
00:23:05,438 --> 00:23:06,698
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

269
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,498
<font color="yellow">It's complicated.</font>

270
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:11,338
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, I have something to tell you.</font>

271
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:14,268
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see the spot in this town that I hate?</font>

272
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,338
<font color="yellow">Why would we go somewhere you hate?</font>

273
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:18,838
<font color="yellow">You'll see when we get there.</font>

274
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:32,668
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

275
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,268
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ko Nan Gil?</font>

276
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:39,638
<font color="yellow">I'm the person who knows Hong Na Ri's father.</font>

277
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:43,598
<font color="yellow">You left me your number at my shop last time, right?</font>

278
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:45,668
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

279
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:50,438
<font color="yellow">Her father said not to tell her...</font>

280
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:52,038
<font color="yellow">and to come alone.</font>

281
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:53,798
<font color="yellow">As soon as possible.</font>

282
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:55,968
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

283
00:23:57,638 --> 00:24:00,068
<font color="yellow">Do you really think he wouldn't tell her?</font>

284
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:02,738
<font color="yellow">Who cares if he does?</font>

285
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:06,068
<font color="yellow">You should get rid of punks like this quickly.</font>

286
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:10,168
<font color="yellow">Be smart about what you say to him.</font>

287
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:13,338

<font color="yellow">You've been leaving whenever you want anyway.</font>

291

292

<font color="yellow">She won't.</font>

293
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:36,998
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

294
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,968
<font color="yellow">The view is nice. Why do you hate this place?</font>

295
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:45,538

301
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:10,638
<font color="yellow">Neighborhood Friend, don't burden me like that.</font>

302
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:12,738
<font color="yellow">I said I won't be your neighborhood friend anymore.</font>

303
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:18,298
<font color="yellow">I'm giving up on building a resort on your land.</font>

305
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,998
<font color="yellow">I feel better now.</font>

306
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:41,198

<font color="yellow">Couldn't you let me enjoy the view? You're so cruel.</font>

309
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,498
<font color="yellow">I'm just honest.</font>

310
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:00,068
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

311
00:26:00,938 --> 00:26:03,838
<font color="yellow">I don't think the two of you can ever become normal.</font>

312
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:07,468
<font color="yellow">Do you even fight?</font>

313
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:10,668
<font color="yellow">Don't you care what others think?</font>

314
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:17,668
<font color="yellow">Then write down why you like Nan Gil.</font>

315
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,638
<font color="yellow">Don't say, "Because he's my stepdad."</font>

316
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:25,668
<font color="yellow">I like you because you're honest.</font>

317
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,498
<font color="yellow">I like you because I feel comforted when I'm with you.</font>

318
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,298
<font color="yellow">I like you because you make me laugh.</font>

319
00:26:31,068 --> 00:26:32,638
<font color="yellow">I like you because you're mature.</font>

320
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,538
<font color="yellow">Stop it. You're making me uncomfortable.</font>

321
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:37,338
<font color="yellow">I was giving you examples.</font>

322
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,738
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Seoul to fight for you.</font>

323

<font color="yellow">(Gyeonggi-do Nursing Home)</font>

324
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:37,398
<font color="yellow">No, thank you. I can do it...</font>

325
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:45,438
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

326
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:48,138
<font color="yellow">You know me, don't you?</font>

327
00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:53,368
<font color="yellow">When I saw you walk in with my daughter,</font>

328
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,668
<font color="yellow">I was stunned.</font>

329
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:57,968
<font color="yellow">I couldn't let on in front of her.</font>

330
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:02,368
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

331
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:06,068
<font color="yellow">despise Bae Byung Woo.</font>

332
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:09,068
<font color="yellow">He did this to my eyes.</font>

333
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,168
<font color="yellow">You're Bae Byung Woo's son, aren't you?</font>

334
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:16,438
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. But I am not anymore.</font>

335
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:20,038
<font color="yellow">Don't give me that. Once a son, always a son.</font>

336
00:28:20,468 --> 00:28:24,138
<font color="yellow">I hate seeing you with my daughter.</font>

337
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,338
<font color="yellow">I don't trust you.</font>

338
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:31,398
<font color="yellow">I should stay with her from now on.</font>

339
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:34,038
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

340
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:37,698
<font color="yellow">live in that house with you.</font>

341
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,598
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

342
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:04,368
<font color="yellow">I guess you are afraid. You're staying in the hospital.</font>

343
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:08,068
<font color="yellow">How could you say that?</font>

344
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:10,068
<font color="yellow">I'm not afraid.</font>

345
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:12,468
<font color="yellow">Is that why you ordered to start construction?</font>

346
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:14,798
<font color="yellow">You know that land belongs to Na Ri.</font>

347
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,968
<font color="yellow">It's my land. I was conned.</font>

348
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:19,468
<font color="yellow">Hong Sung Gyu came to me and showed me a document,</font>

349
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,868
<font color="yellow">demanding money. All I did was pay him.</font>

350
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:27,268
<font color="yellow">That document was fake and he ran away.</font>

351
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:30,538
<font color="yellow">Hong Sung Kyu? Na Ri's father?</font>

352
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:34,138
<font color="yellow">Father, my foot. He's a total con artist!</font>

353
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,068
<font color="yellow">His wife wouldn't hand over the deed,</font>

354
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:39,168
<font color="yellow">so he ran away with his daughter!</font>

355
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:42,398
<font color="yellow">He ran away with his daughter? With Na Ri?</font>

356
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,898
<font color="yellow">How could he kidnap his daughter because of some land?</font>

357
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:47,298
<font color="yellow">If she weren't his daughter,</font>

358
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:51,168
<font color="yellow">he would've been locked up for kidnapping!</font>

359
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,368
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you seem fine as expected.</font>

360
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:07,268
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, then.</font>

361
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,968
<font color="yellow">You can't just go.</font>

362
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:18,468
<font color="yellow">Go to Seulgi-ri.</font>

363
00:30:19,368 --> 00:30:20,438
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

364
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:23,738
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Find out what's going on...</font>

365
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:28,598
<font color="yellow">between Duk Bong and Hong Na Ri.</font>

366
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,198
<font color="yellow">Have a nice day.</font>

367
00:30:41,168 --> 00:30:42,338
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

368
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:46,468
<font color="yellow">I stopped by and they were busy, so I helped.</font>

369
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:48,438
<font color="yellow">Where did you go?</font>

370
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:51,368
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Answer me.</font>

371
00:30:54,498 --> 00:30:55,998
<font color="yellow">It won't work between us.</font>

372
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,468
<font color="yellow">- Will you keep doing that? - What?</font>

373
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,568
<font color="yellow">Will you be nervous every time I go somewhere?</font>

374
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:07,298
<font color="yellow">You can just tell me where you went.</font>

375
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,568
<font color="yellow">I went to see your father. He said to come alone.</font>

376
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,968
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

377
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:14,868
<font color="yellow">He wanted to know who I was. And he wants to come here.</font>

378
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:17,868
<font color="yellow">He didn't call for 20 years.</font>

379
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:19,838
<font color="yellow">Now, he wants to act like a father?</font>

380
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:24,038
<font color="yellow">- What did he say? - I thought I was going to die.</font>

381
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,668
<font color="yellow">Why? What did he do?</font>

382
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:27,568
<font color="yellow">He shoved an entire clementine in my mouth.</font>

383
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:28,868
<font color="yellow">I almost suffocated.</font>

384
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:31,638
<font color="yellow">He was good to me.</font>

385
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:34,598
<font color="yellow">He said to keep it a secret that I saw him.</font>

386
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,638
<font color="yellow">Now that I told you, my conscience is bothering me.</font>

387
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:41,798
<font color="yellow">Then why did you tell me?</font>

388
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:44,298
<font color="yellow">In case you'd get weird ideas and get nervous.</font>

389
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:48,298
<font color="yellow">That's normal when a man and woman start dating.</font>

390
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:51,368
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

391
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:00,438
<font color="yellow">You're Bae Byung Woo's son, aren't you?</font>

392
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:02,298
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

393
00:32:03,598 --> 00:32:05,868
<font color="yellow">live in that house with you.</font>

394
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,498
<font color="yellow">You seemed closed but your light was on, so I came in.</font>

395
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:29,338
<font color="yellow">My father is in a hospital. The threats worked.</font>

396
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:32,268
<font color="yellow">He goes to a hospital when he's afraid.</font>

397
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:37,038
<font color="yellow">Leave Na Ri's land matter to me from now on.</font>

398
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:41,968
<font color="yellow">Looks like you have a lot on your mind, too.</font>

399
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:46,068
<font color="yellow">I heard you're going to date like a normal couple.</font>

400
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:49,238
<font color="yellow">Why did she tell the neighborhood friend all that?</font>

401
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,068
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil.</font>

402
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:54,568
<font color="yellow">You didn't show yourself to Na Ri...</font>

403
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:56,998
<font color="yellow">before her mother passed away, did you?</font>

404
00:32:58,338 --> 00:32:59,398
<font color="yellow">Why was that?</font>

405
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:02,868
<font color="yellow">You are too curious about me.</font>

406
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:06,968
<font color="yellow">You never once thought about a future with her.</font>

407
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,738
<font color="yellow">No. I'm sure you never even dreamed about it.</font>

408
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,298
<font color="yellow">You knew yourself too well.</font>

409
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:18,338
<font color="yellow">Na Ri seems concerned, too.</font>

410
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:21,338
<font color="yellow">Do you even share your concerns with each other?</font>

411
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,068
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you together right now?</font>

412
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:26,398
<font color="yellow">You are not a good match,</font>

413
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,998
<font color="yellow">and you can't handle each other.</font>

414
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:40,138
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

415
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:42,338
<font color="yellow">Am I the Death himself or something?</font>

416
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:43,638
<font color="yellow">Why are you so scared?</font>

417
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,768
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

418
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:49,238
<font color="yellow">Look at this pigsty.</font>

419
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:53,298
<font color="yellow">You say the same thing every time you come.</font>

420
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,838
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

421
00:33:56,498 --> 00:33:59,398
<font color="yellow">What's going on between your brother and Hong Na Ri?</font>

422
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:10,298
<font color="yellow">You look like you know everything,</font>

423
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:11,768
<font color="yellow">but are you not going to tell me?</font>

424
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:13,238
<font color="yellow">I can't say.</font>

425
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:15,538
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to Seoul.</font>

426
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:16,798
<font color="yellow">A one-sided crush.</font>

427
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:18,338
<font color="yellow">Who? Na Ri?</font>

428
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:21,798
<font color="yellow">No. Duk Bong has a crush on her.</font>

429
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:22,938
<font color="yellow">Kwon Duk Shim!</font>

430
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:28,798
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

431
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,038
<font color="yellow">The chairman figured it out.</font>

432
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,298
<font color="yellow">He told me to come.</font>

433
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:39,068
<font color="yellow">Should I meet Na Ri?</font>

434
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:40,438
<font color="yellow">- No. - Mom.</font>

435
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:44,908
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything.</font>

436
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,998
<font color="yellow">Yong Kyu. It's too wet.</font>

437
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,538
<font color="yellow">Joon. It's dry.</font>

438
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,168
<font color="yellow">Hani.</font>

439
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,298
<font color="yellow">I'm at a loss with you.</font>

440
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:07,568
<font color="yellow">I'll redo them. Reflect on what went wrong and redo it.</font>

441
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:10,138
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this?</font>

442
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:13,408
<font color="yellow">All you need is one master. That's how things work.</font>

443
00:35:13,408 --> 00:35:15,938
<font color="yellow">No excuses. Proceed now.</font>

444
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:18,038
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - What a scary boss.</font>

445
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,468
<font color="yellow">They'll be exhausted before you even open.</font>

446
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:24,268
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? - To work.</font>

447
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:25,638
<font color="yellow">To discuss my leave of absence.</font>

448
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:29,968
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

449
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:32,138
<font color="yellow">"What do you plan to do?"</font>

450
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:33,668
<font color="yellow">"Will you return to work?"</font>

451
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,068
<font color="yellow">To discuss things like that.</font>

452
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:37,768
<font color="yellow">I see. You've thought it over, right?</font>

453
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,668
<font color="yellow">You know that's what you love to do and do best.</font>

454
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:42,068
<font color="yellow">You'll say you'll go back, right?</font>

455
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:46,368
<font color="yellow">You look like a parent,</font>

456
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:48,268
<font color="yellow">not a normal boyfriend.</font>

457
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:52,268
<font color="yellow">Don't stand like that.</font>

458
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,568
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

459
00:35:58,938 --> 00:36:00,638
<font color="yellow">We are so not normal.</font>

460
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:07,298
<font color="yellow">Boss. I'm asking in all seriousness.</font>

461
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,498
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid of the daughter?</font>

462
00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:11,498
<font color="yellow">Why are you out here? Did you finish the filling?</font>

463
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:14,168
<font color="yellow">Don't act tough to the weak.</font>

464
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,638
<font color="yellow">- It makes me sad. - Get inside.</font>

465
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:18,338
<font color="yellow">- Get inside. Now. - Wait.</font>

466
00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:20,368
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

467
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:23,568
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

468
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:30,738
<font color="yellow">What a loud entrance. This is a hospital.</font>

469
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,298
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking into Na Ri?</font>

470
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:48,068
<font color="yellow">I looked into her because you said it was her land.</font>

471
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:52,168
<font color="yellow">I'm going to build a luxury resort on that land...</font>

472
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,968
<font color="yellow">and put up a statue of me. It's all for you guys!</font>

473
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:56,268
<font color="yellow">So no one will disrespect you!</font>

474
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:58,638
<font color="yellow">Will that bury what you did to your hometown?</font>

475
00:36:58,638 --> 00:37:00,598
<font color="yellow">It was over 40 years ago.</font>

476
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:03,998
<font color="yellow">You're a loser, letting a girl push you around.</font>

477
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:06,298
<font color="yellow">Just marry her then.</font>

478
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:08,238
<font color="yellow">That would be a great solution.</font>

479
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:12,638
<font color="yellow">Leave my personal life alone.</font>

480
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:31,798
<font color="yellow">Yeo Joo.</font>

481
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:39,338
<font color="yellow">You looked scary, so I was going to walk on by.</font>

482
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,068
<font color="yellow">Okay, I look scary.</font>

483
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,038
<font color="yellow">You look happy.</font>

484
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:46,138
<font color="yellow">The hospital bill was less than expected.</font>

485
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,198
<font color="yellow">I envy you.</font>

486
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,068
<font color="yellow">Who envies whom?</font>

487
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:52,038
<font color="yellow">Don't be annoying.</font>

488
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:55,168
<font color="yellow">No wonder you get along with Duk Shim.</font>

489
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:59,198
<font color="yellow">I've never heard that I get along with someone.</font>

490
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:01,198
<font color="yellow">I never expected it to be a teenager, though.</font>

491
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,438
<font color="yellow">See? You act like a teen, too.</font>

492
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,968
<font color="yellow">Do I seem like your baby sister?</font>

493
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,668
<font color="yellow">Do you want to protect me? Am I cute and lovable?</font>

494
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:15,998
<font color="yellow">None of those apply to Duk Shim.</font>

495
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:18,768
<font color="yellow">I just worry about where she'll disappear to next.</font>

496
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:21,538
<font color="yellow">Duk Bong.</font>

497
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,038
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that to me.</font>

498
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:25,668
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

499
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:29,138
<font color="yellow">A big brother who worries about his sister looks cool.</font>

500
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:33,638
<font color="yellow">I have more to jot down every time I see you.</font>

501
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:38,908
<font color="yellow">Have a nice day. Tell Duk Shim I say, "Hi."</font>

502
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,298
<font color="yellow">We think it would be best to have you return...</font>

503
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,338
<font color="yellow">which is why we asked you to come in.</font>

504
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:56,668
<font color="yellow">You're too young to retire.</font>

505
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:00,038
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be best to work a few more years?</font>

506
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,298
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll think about it.</font>

507
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:20,638
<font color="yellow">I changed my flight schedule...</font>

508
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:22,338
<font color="yellow">to see you after your meeting.</font>

509
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:23,338
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

510
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:26,738
<font color="yellow">So make some time for me.</font>

511
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,668
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

512
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:33,908
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

513
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:37,068
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

514
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:42,238
<font color="yellow">I never worked so hard on a woman before.</font>

515
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,068
<font color="yellow">You act smart, so you figure out why.</font>

516
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,838
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're working hard on me?</font>

517
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,968
<font color="yellow">I'm neither a senior colleague nor a woman to you.</font>

518
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:53,038
<font color="yellow">I'm just a link between you and Duk Bong,</font>

519
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:55,698
<font color="yellow">and you have to be friendly to me. Am I wrong?</font>

520
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:57,568
<font color="yellow">You're not a link.</font>

521
00:39:57,668 --> 00:39:59,438
<font color="yellow">You're wrong this time.</font>

522
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,698
<font color="yellow">I wanted to give you a warning.</font>

523
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:04,068
<font color="yellow">A warning?</font>

524
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,298
<font color="yellow">Stop acting cool.</font>

525
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:09,408
<font color="yellow">If someone like Duk Bong says he likes you, grab on.</font>

526
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:13,768
<font color="yellow">Try closing your eyes...</font>

527
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,838
<font color="yellow">and transfer Nan Gil to Seoul.</font>

528
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,238
<font color="yellow">You go to a dumpling place, and Nan Gil is there.</font>

529
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:24,438
<font color="yellow">Then you would think, "A cute guy..."</font>

530
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:26,238
<font color="yellow">"makes dumplings well, too."</font>

531
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:28,868
<font color="yellow">You would eat the dumplings and just leave.</font>

532
00:40:29,238 --> 00:40:31,068
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Yeo Joo. - Yes?</font>

533
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:33,538
<font color="yellow">Did you think Nan Gil was cute?</font>

534
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:36,138
<font color="yellow">That's not the point right now.</font>

535
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,998
<font color="yellow">I'm annoyed about seeing you again if I return to work.</font>

536
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:44,068
<font color="yellow">I wanted to apologize to you at some point,</font>

537
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:47,338
<font color="yellow">but whenever I see you, I don't want to anymore.</font>

538
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:50,538
<font color="yellow">Why are you so honest now?</font>

539
00:40:52,598 --> 00:40:54,968
<font color="yellow">Just admit you like Duk Bong and you'll be done.</font>

540
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:57,968
<font color="yellow">Well then. I have somewhere to get to.</font>

541
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:09,268
<font color="yellow">(Gyeonggi-do Nursing Home)</font>

542
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:15,938
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

543
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:19,138
<font color="yellow">I'll get your room ready.</font>

544
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,068
<font color="yellow">I'm not going.</font>

545
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:25,568
<font color="yellow">I need to have a conscience...</font>

546
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,198
<font color="yellow">to end up in a good place when I die.</font>

547
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,438
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

548
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:37,038
<font color="yellow">someone will have to protect the house.</font>

549
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:38,968
<font color="yellow">We only have...</font>

550
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:42,138
<font color="yellow">each other in this world.</font>

551
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:44,698
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil is running the dumpling house,</font>

552
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:46,368
<font color="yellow">so you won't be bored.</font>

553
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,568
<font color="yellow">He didn't tell you?</font>

554
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,638
<font color="yellow">I can't live with him.</font>

555
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,438
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

556
00:41:53,438 --> 00:41:54,938
<font color="yellow">He did this to my eyes...</font>

557
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:58,338
<font color="yellow">and I know how he lived. How could I live with him?</font>

558
00:42:01,598 --> 00:42:03,438
<font color="yellow">This began with you.</font>

559
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:05,298
<font color="yellow">You didn't take any responsibility.</font>

560
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:07,298
<font color="yellow">You abandoned Mom and me and stayed in hiding.</font>

561
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:10,838
<font color="yellow">You should've taken responsibility.</font>

562
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:15,908
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil was dragged into this because of you.</font>

563
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,568
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to survive.</font>

564
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:20,498
<font color="yellow">You wanted to survive alone,</font>

565
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,998
<font color="yellow">so you dumped that huge debt on Mom and me?</font>

566
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:27,638
<font color="yellow">If you refuse to live with him,</font>

567
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,908
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Nan Gil to choose...</font>

568
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:33,768
<font color="yellow">since he's the one who protected it.</font>

569
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:38,538
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you once in a while.</font>

570
00:43:01,598 --> 00:43:03,998
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Get out of my mom's and my house.</font>

571
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,138
<font color="yellow">I told you it's my house. I can't leave.</font>

572
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:08,268
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

573
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:10,268
<font color="yellow">Who are you to say my house is yours?</font>

574
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,538
<font color="yellow">Who are you really?</font>

575
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,268
<font color="yellow">Your father.</font>

576
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:32,238
<font color="yellow">Let's not be family so that we can be together.</font>

577
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:33,568
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

578
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:36,338
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

579
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:38,838
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

580
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:46,198
<font color="yellow">Even if I can never say it again,</font>

581
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:52,298
<font color="yellow">I will love you.</font>

582
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,968
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

583
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,138
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

584
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:59,368
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine. - What were you doing?</font>

585
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:06,498
<font color="yellow">Just stay still. Don't say a word.</font>

586
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:10,998
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I won't do it again.</font>

587
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:12,538
<font color="yellow">It won't work between us.</font>

588
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:34,068
<font color="yellow">Enough.</font>

589
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:39,068
<font color="yellow">It's not just about strength.</font>

590
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:43,768
<font color="yellow">You're late. How did it go?</font>

591
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:45,568
<font color="yellow">I said I'd think about it.</font>

592
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:46,868
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

593
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:58,768
<font color="yellow">It must have been very difficult, putting up with...</font>

594
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:01,498
<font color="yellow">an abusive boss and having to come in early.</font>

595
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:04,868
<font color="yellow">So let's go on a retreat...</font>

596
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,568
<font color="yellow">and build on our relationship.</font>

597
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,068
<font color="yellow">- A retreat? - A retreat?</font>

598
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,468
<font color="yellow">I'm the boss. Why are you making the calls?</font>

599
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:13,298
<font color="yellow">Retreat. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat!</font>

600
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:15,998
<font color="yellow">Retreat. Retreat. Retreat.</font>

601
00:45:16,138 --> 00:45:18,698
<font color="yellow">We made some money because of the show, right?</font>

602
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:20,738
<font color="yellow">Then can we get on a plane?</font>

603
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:24,768
<font color="yellow">- What about you? - I can go if it's a weekend.</font>

604
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,338
<font color="yellow">Then there's something I need you to do.</font>

605
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:32,198
<font color="yellow">Get out. Why would I go to Hong Dumplings' retreat?</font>

606
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:34,968
<font color="yellow">I'm a minor. I need a guardian.</font>

607
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:38,268
<font color="yellow">Duk Shim, do you even consider me your guardian?</font>

608
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,138
<font color="yellow">I totally do.</font>

609
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:42,538
<font color="yellow">You'll say anything to go on the retreat.</font>

610
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:44,338
<font color="yellow">Get Greenland to sponsor.</font>

611
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:46,298
<font color="yellow">You've got to be kidding me.</font>

612
00:45:46,298 --> 00:45:48,298
<font color="yellow">Na Ri asked me to do it.</font>

613
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,568
<font color="yellow">She really wants you there.</font>

614
00:45:51,938 --> 00:45:53,798
<font color="yellow">I said you'll be my guardian, give a ride,</font>

615
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:56,138
<font color="yellow">and book the resort.</font>

616
00:45:56,138 --> 00:45:59,798
<font color="yellow">If you don't go, the retreat will fall through.</font>

617
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:04,268
<font color="yellow">Did she really say that?</font>

618
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:07,768
<font color="yellow">I saw my father after my meeting at work.</font>

619
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:09,568
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him to move in?</font>

620
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:11,898
<font color="yellow">I said I'd visit once in a while.</font>

621
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:18,838
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me he refused to live with you?</font>

622
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:23,638
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that I understood how he felt.</font>

623
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:28,798
<font color="yellow">How do you think you would've lived...</font>

624
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:31,068
<font color="yellow">if this hadn't happened to my mom and me?</font>

625
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:35,738
<font color="yellow">I probably would've worked at a dumplings place.</font>

626
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:38,068
<font color="yellow">I would've visited your mother occasionally...</font>

627
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:40,138
<font color="yellow">and complained about her dumplings.</font>

628
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:43,798
<font color="yellow">You would've been a regular guy who kneads dough.</font>

629
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:47,368
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

630
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:50,698
<font color="yellow">Why? What for?</font>

631
00:46:51,538 --> 00:46:55,838
<font color="yellow">When I saw you hurt, I knew it was because of me,</font>

632
00:46:56,368 --> 00:46:59,268
<font color="yellow">but I was so shocked and nervous that I got angry.</font>

633
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:02,898
<font color="yellow">It's still so hard for you that you can't breathe...</font>

634
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:04,598
<font color="yellow">when you think about those days,</font>

635
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:08,068
<font color="yellow">but you put up with it because of me.</font>

636
00:47:09,568 --> 00:47:13,068
<font color="yellow">It must've been hard, but I thought only of myself.</font>

637
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:15,538
<font color="yellow">That was my choice because I love you.</font>

638
00:47:15,538 --> 00:47:17,998
<font color="yellow">I've never regretted it, and it's all taken care of.</font>

639
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,038
<font color="yellow">Don't apologize to me again.</font>

640
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:21,838
<font color="yellow">You have no reason to be sorry.</font>

641
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:25,238
<font color="yellow">I've been cured from my Ko Nan Gil disease.</font>

642
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:28,198
<font color="yellow">I don't need my medicine anymore. I'm really fine.</font>

643
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:33,568
<font color="yellow">I never got to tell you this.</font>

644
00:47:35,368 --> 00:47:36,568
<font color="yellow">Nan Gil,</font>

645
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:39,798
<font color="yellow">thank you for being my stepdad.</font>

646
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:55,338
<font color="yellow">I'm done with work, so let's go on a date.</font>

647
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:01,068
<font color="yellow">I'll show you that I'm all better.</font>

648
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:03,498
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere very loud.</font>

649
00:48:13,498 --> 00:48:14,568
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

650
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:29,468
<font color="yellow">Faster.</font>

651
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:37,368
<font color="yellow">Can't you do better?</font>

652
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:39,368
<font color="yellow">This is hard.</font>

653
00:48:41,938 --> 00:48:42,968
<font color="yellow">It's hard.</font>

654
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:46,568
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

655
00:49:19,738 --> 00:49:20,738
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

656
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:32,668
<font color="yellow">Enjoy yourselves. Let me know if you need anything.</font>

657
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:34,798
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

658
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:45,538
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

659
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:50,468
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

660
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:53,938
<font color="yellow">Just seeing these bags...</font>

661
00:49:53,998 --> 00:49:56,468
<font color="yellow">should let her know that I will be living here...</font>

662
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:58,238
<font color="yellow">with you for the rest of my life.</font>

663
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:00,438
<font color="yellow">I'm not moving in!</font>

664
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:11,198
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

665
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:13,568
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

666
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:27,168
<font color="yellow">Awesome. What is he wearing?</font>

667
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,068
<font color="yellow">Is he trying to look like Nan Gil?</font>

668
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:38,768
<font color="yellow">Is it working?</font>

669
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:41,168
<font color="yellow">- What? - Is it igniting?</font>

670
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:43,668
<font color="yellow">I'm trying.</font>

671
00:50:46,068 --> 00:50:47,968
<font color="yellow">You should put that in.</font>

672
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:50,438
<font color="yellow">Is kneading all you know how to do?</font>

673
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,568
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

674
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:11,898
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

675
00:51:13,598 --> 00:51:15,898
<font color="yellow">Duk Shim, don't just eat meat.</font>

676
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,168
<font color="yellow">Have some shrimps, too.</font>

677
00:51:19,468 --> 00:51:21,768
<font color="yellow">Why is someone so young acting like an old man?</font>

678
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:23,068
<font color="yellow">Let me borrow that.</font>

679
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:25,798
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

680
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:31,868
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

681
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:33,568
<font color="yellow">Here are the garlic.</font>

682
00:51:33,898 --> 00:51:35,838
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, have some meat.</font>

683
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:37,368
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

684
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:41,668
<font color="yellow">Try it with this garlic sauce. I made it myself.</font>

685
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:48,798
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it good? - Yes, it's really good.</font>

686
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,798
<font color="yellow">Garlic? Whatever.</font>

687
00:51:53,668 --> 00:51:55,938
<font color="yellow">Dumplings. Dumplings. Dumplings. Five.</font>

688
00:51:57,768 --> 00:51:59,738
<font color="yellow">Dumplings. Dumplings. Dumplings.</font>

689
00:51:59,738 --> 00:52:00,738
<font color="yellow">Ten.</font>

690
00:52:02,238 --> 00:52:03,568
<font color="yellow">I won.</font>

691
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:05,238
<font color="yellow">- Next. - Why have you been...</font>

692
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:08,138
<font color="yellow">teaching them how to make the filling these days?</font>

693
00:52:08,698 --> 00:52:10,068
<font color="yellow">It's time they learn.</font>

694
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,068
<font color="yellow">Wrong. That's not it.</font>

695
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,068
<font color="yellow">You planned to leave after talking to my dad.</font>

696
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:20,368
<font color="yellow">I can't imagine Hong Dumplings without you.</font>

697
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:23,638
<font color="yellow">You think it's right that I leave.</font>

698
00:52:24,298 --> 00:52:26,798
<font color="yellow">Isn't this retreat your gift to me?</font>

699
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:28,368
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

700
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:32,368
<font color="yellow">Try living as Ko Nan Gil, not my stepdad...</font>

701
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:35,038
<font color="yellow">or Hong Dumplings' owner.</font>

702
00:52:35,938 --> 00:52:37,738
<font color="yellow">Then let's say this retreat...</font>

703
00:52:38,468 --> 00:52:40,938
<font color="yellow">is the real beginning of Ko Nan Gil's life.</font>

704
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:42,468
<font color="yellow">How will you start it?</font>

705
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:46,338
<font color="yellow">Once I leave, I'll lead a normal life.</font>

706
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:48,498
<font color="yellow">I'll get a job and take trips.</font>

707
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,868
<font color="yellow">Once I gain the courage, I'll get a new girlfriend.</font>

708
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:55,268
<font color="yellow">The Hong Na Ri in Seoul whom I don't know.</font>

709
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:02,398
<font color="yellow">Fine. You've loved me for a very long time.</font>

710
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:07,568
<font color="yellow">So the Hong Na Ri in Seoul will wait.</font>

711
00:53:20,438 --> 00:53:21,438
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

712
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,338
<font color="yellow">The chairman changed the resort's layout.</font>

713
00:53:26,368 --> 00:53:27,498
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

714
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,138
<font color="yellow">take it any longer.</font>

715
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:42,798
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

716
00:53:44,938 --> 00:53:46,338
<font color="yellow">I did all I could.</font>

717
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:55,368
<font color="yellow">I got excited, thinking you were running toward me.</font>

718
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:59,198
<font color="yellow">At times like these, it's not bad having a sister.</font>

719
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:05,268
<font color="yellow">Neighborhood Friend. Is something wrong?</font>

720
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:08,368
<font color="yellow">I have to go to Seoul and fight my father.</font>

721
00:54:09,168 --> 00:54:12,698
<font color="yellow">I've felt this and been in this kind of situations.</font>

722
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:15,068
<font color="yellow">I was on his side before,</font>

723
00:54:15,238 --> 00:54:16,738
<font color="yellow">but I'm on yours this time.</font>

724
00:54:17,898 --> 00:54:20,968
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can wish you luck against your father.</font>

725
00:54:21,698 --> 00:54:23,368
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Just wish me luck.</font>

726
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:25,998
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

727
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:31,198
<font color="yellow">Do you have any memories of your father?</font>

728
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:32,398
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

729
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,538
<font color="yellow">All I know is...</font>

730
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:37,398
<font color="yellow">that my very first flight was with my father.</font>

731
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:40,068
<font color="yellow">I plan to ask him since I met him.</font>

732
00:54:40,198 --> 00:54:41,738
<font color="yellow">You met your father?</font>

733
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:04,238
<font color="yellow">It's so cold.</font>

734
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,198
<font color="yellow">Did Na Ri find her father?</font>

735
00:55:10,538 --> 00:55:11,538
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

736
00:55:12,138 --> 00:55:14,668
<font color="yellow">All the fathers are just incredible.</font>

737
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:18,438
<font color="yellow">I heard Na Ri's father...</font>

738
00:55:18,438 --> 00:55:20,798
<font color="yellow">was a con man who kidnapped her for the land.</font>

739
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,038
<font color="yellow">How could he show his face to her again?</font>

740
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:26,538
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

741
00:55:28,138 --> 00:55:29,198
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kwon.</font>

742
00:55:33,198 --> 00:55:35,698
<font color="yellow">Mom may be hurt if she hears this,</font>

743
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:37,598
<font color="yellow">but I didn't hate my father.</font>

744
00:55:37,698 --> 00:55:40,598
<font color="yellow">The first time I rode a plane was with my father.</font>

745
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,998
<font color="yellow">I was too young to remember much,</font>

746
00:55:44,268 --> 00:55:47,938
<font color="yellow">but I remember being shocked at how big it was.</font>

747
00:55:50,068 --> 00:55:52,198
<font color="yellow">I wonder why Mom didn't go with us.</font>

748
00:55:53,038 --> 00:55:54,998
<font color="yellow">Where did I go alone with my father?</font>

749
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:56,368
<font color="yellow">I wonder.</font>

750
00:55:56,568 --> 00:55:58,998
<font color="yellow">It must not have been fun if you can't remember.</font>

751
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:00,368
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was.</font>

752
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:02,938
<font color="yellow">My father was pretty funny.</font>

753
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:05,938
<font color="yellow">Everyone in town liked him.</font>

754
00:56:06,298 --> 00:56:09,398
<font color="yellow">But whenever I told my mom that,</font>

755
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:12,438
<font color="yellow">she said I never flew with my dad...</font>

756
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:14,698
<font color="yellow">although I remember for certain.</font>

757
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:18,768
<font color="yellow">No. I rode an airplane with my father.</font>

758
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:19,768
<font color="yellow">I'm positive.</font>

759
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:33,298
<font color="yellow">- Do you have everything? - Yes.</font>

760
00:56:33,398 --> 00:56:34,938
<font color="yellow">Rest up today. See you tomorrow.</font>

761
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:35,938
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

762
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,238
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Boss. - I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

763
00:57:18,998 --> 00:57:20,238
<font color="yellow">When are you leaving?</font>

764
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:24,068
<font color="yellow">Did you think I didn't know?</font>

765
00:57:25,038 --> 00:57:27,698
<font color="yellow">Even Duk Shim could tell you were leaving.</font>

766
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:31,438
<font color="yellow">After I resolve the land matter.</font>

767
