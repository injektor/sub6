3
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:13,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you bringing so much stuff?</font>

4
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,355
<font color=#FFFF00>These are all things
that we'll be needing.</font>

5
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:17,058
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'll read a book or two...</font>

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,662
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going to stay cooped up in the
hotel room, at this rate.</font>

7
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:21,939
<font color=#FFFF00>You really do hate moving around.</font>

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,669
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll call us a cab!</font>

9
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you expecting someone?</font>

10
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:29,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Nope, nobody.</font>

11
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:36,566
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo!</font>

12
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:38,298
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

13
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:39,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Look!</font>

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,316
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my gosh!
- Wow.</font>

15
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:48,813
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh!</font>

16
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:53,495
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come in, Chef Ohn!</font>

17
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:56,621
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

18
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:59,124
<font color=#FFFF00>We're leaving for a trip
today, though.</font>

19
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:01,176
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I came to carry
your things for you.</font>

20
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,333
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you opening your
restaurant today?</font>

21
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,802
<font color=#FFFF00>It's closed until tomorrow.</font>

22
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:06,409
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this the stuff you need carried?</font>

23
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,222
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

24
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,063
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes!</font>

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,096
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, um, this too.</font>

26
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,903
<font color=#FFFF00>There will be tons of traffic if you
wait much longer, so hurry up.</font>

27
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,163
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

28
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:30,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh, I can't believe
that this is happening!</font>

29
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:32,793
<font color=#FFFF00>What's with you?</font>

30
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,439
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, right?
Why am I being like this?</font>

31
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,010
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like this happened to me!</font>

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,361
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness!</font>

33
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:40,237
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh!</font>

34
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:48,538
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, they took the 7:15
bullet train from Yongsan Station</font>

35
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:51,204
<font color=#FFFF00>so they'll probably be eating
lunch in Yeosu by noon.</font>

36
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:52,695
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you seem so excited.</font>

37
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,674
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm actually excited for the
first time in a while!</font>

38
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is this tugging at my heartstrings
when it's someone else's love story?</font>

39
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,938
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been such a long time since I last
fell into that crazy thing called love!</font>

40
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:31,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we play some music, Chef Ohn?</font>

41
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:33,430
<font color=#FFFF00>We sure can.</font>

42
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we turn the music off, Chef Ohn?</font>

43
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,032
<font color=#FFFF00>We sure can.</font>

44
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:49,882
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

45
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:53,327
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? I'm pretending
that he's my boyfriend!</font>

46
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,489
<font color=#FFFF00>I just really wanted to try it
because I'm so envious!</font>

47
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:56,737
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Kyung!</font>

48
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Hyun Soo won't like it
if you say things like that.</font>

49
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, she's not like that.</font>

50
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, what's with you two?</font>

51
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,980
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm your mutual contact!</font>

52
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,143
<font color=#FFFF00>So I don't think it's nice for you to
team up and tease me.</font>

53
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Who else would we tease, then?</font>

54
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,261
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't tease someone
we don't know well.</font>

55
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Thumbs up, Chef Ohn!</font>

56
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:15,284
<font color=#FFFF00>So you think I'll just sit here
and take this? Yeah, I will.</font>

57
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:18,643
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on!</font>

58
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,786
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we play some music, Chef Ohn?</font>

59
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,796
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, stop it already!</font>

60
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:30,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go get it on!</font>

61
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:48,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Park!</font>

62
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,934
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh goodness, Hong Ah!</font>

63
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,552
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you!</font>

64
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,377
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go, Writer Park.</font>

65
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:56,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, what's this?</font>

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,656
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought it because I figured
that it'd suit you well.</font>

67
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations on getting
your script chosen!</font>

68
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,840
<font color=#FFFF00>It's only because you taught
me so many things.</font>

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You're doing well, I presume?</font>

70
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,718
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I possibly be doing well?</font>

71
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,257
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you heard the news, too.</font>

72
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:14,957
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh... I see.</font>

73
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:19,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, that girl Hyun Soo keeps
going around insulting me so much</font>

74
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,967
<font color=#FFFF00>that I can't even look
my seniors in the face!</font>

75
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:23,962
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

76
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:26,846
<font color=#FFFF00>She's going around portraying me
as this completely villainous person!</font>

77
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:29,861
<font color=#FFFF00>And all the other writers who
don't really know Hyun Soo</font>

78
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,510
<font color=#FFFF00>all believe that nonsense!</font>

79
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:35,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I seem like the type of writer
who'd go behind another writer's back</font>

80
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:38,896
<font color=#FFFF00>and strike a deal with their director
to backstab them?</font>

81
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:41,385
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not that kind of
person, Writer Park.</font>

82
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:43,921
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure that people will realize this
for themselves, in time.</font>

83
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:44,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Right?</font>

84
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,894
<font color=#FFFF00>So go around saying that to
people you know, okay?</font>

85
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:49,668
<font color=#FFFF00>My story will sound more credible</font>

86
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,642
<font color=#FFFF00>if someone who spent a lot of time
with Hyun Soo, like you, says this.</font>

87
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:56,154
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, how disgraceful!</font>

88
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:58,974
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think you'll suffer any
huge losses just because</font>

89
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:00,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo is insulting
you behind your back.</font>

90
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:04,692
<font color=#FFFF00>As long as you're successful,
insults are...</font>

91
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about it too much.</font>

92
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,668
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because I'm not successful
that I'm worried!</font>

93
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,942
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so hard to get a new project!</font>

94
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,111
<font color=#FFFF00>They like younger writers for
genre-specific work.</font>

95
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:19,219
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so honest, Writer Park.</font>

96
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,836
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I like you.</font>

97
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,538
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I say? I'm the same,
inside and out.</font>

98
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,719
<font color=#FFFF00>At any rate, thanks
for having my back.</font>

99
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:29,620
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a great writer
and you're so refined</font>

100
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,322
<font color=#FFFF00>so all you need now is to make it big.</font>

101
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Writer Park.</font>

102
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you introduced yourself
to Chief Producer Yoo Hong Jin?</font>

103
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,817
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

104
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to him!</font>

105
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:42,808
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll help you use your
background to your advantage.</font>

106
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:47,503
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for your advice.</font>

107
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why you need a mentor.</font>

108
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:53,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell Hyun Soo to stop going around
insulting me!</font>

109
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:58,361
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does she know so many people?
Because she graduated from a good school?</font>

110
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:01,147
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, what's this?</font>

111
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,115
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our room.</font>

112
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Head in.
My room is over there.</font>

113
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,387
<font color=#FFFF00>See you in the lobby
in 30 minutes, Chef!</font>

114
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,445
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

115
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,834
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo!</font>

116
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,262
<font color=#FFFF00>Chef Ohn is super great!</font>

117
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,418
<font color=#FFFF00>He's super, super great!</font>

118
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:31,952
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

119
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,783
<font color=#FFFF00>If you let him slip away,
you're stupid!</font>

120
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Does he seem that good
of a guy to you?</font>

121
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:36,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see the look
in his eyes?</font>

122
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,404
<font color=#FFFF00>There are stars in his eyes!</font>

123
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:42,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen a man
with stars in his eyes!</font>

124
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,120
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm only letting you have him
because you're you!</font>

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,765
<font color=#FFFF00>Stars?
As if!</font>

126
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,212
<font color=#FFFF00>No, he really has
stars in his eyes!</font>

127
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:52,043
<font color=#FFFF00>Twinkle, twinkle!
Twinkle, twinkle!</font>

128
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,170
<font color=#FFFF00>- <i>[Director Kim Joon Ha]</i>
- Ugh.</font>

129
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,584
<font color=#FFFF00>He can't stand to see me
even a little bit happy!</font>

130
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:03,873
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I have to imagine that I'm talking to
Chef Ohn instead of Director Kim?</font>

131
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,435
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it.</font>

132
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You got jealous just now,
Hyun Soo!</font>

133
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:09,550
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I didn't!</font>

134
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Director?</font>

135
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you?
I just arrived.</font>

136
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,156
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come out by myself.
Hyun Soo is busy.</font>

137
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,255
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

138
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you?</font>

139
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,346
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

140
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:31,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo checked in!
I confirmed it with Writer Hwangbo.</font>

141
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:33,820
<font color=#FFFF00>I can only get together
with them around dinnertime.</font>

142
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,238
<font color=#FFFF00>There's some business I need to
take care of since I'm here.</font>

143
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it was weird that you didn't
put up much of a fight.</font>

144
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,611
<font color=#FFFF00>You only came because you had
business here, didn't you?</font>

145
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:42,971
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

146
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:46,079
<font color=#FFFF00>Um... I'll stay with Writer Hwangbo.</font>

147
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,557
<font color=#FFFF00>You go do everything
you want to do.</font>

148
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:50,187
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll set the mood for you two
before then.</font>

149
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

150
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:20,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

151
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:24,103
<font color=#FFFF00>You're downstairs already?</font>

152
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yes!</font>

153
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:28,966
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Soo will be down soon.
I'm going to go off on my own.</font>

154
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

155
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:33,331
<font color=#FFFF00>A director I know is here, and
I have to keep him company.</font>

156
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:35,992
<font color=#FFFF00>He has a weird personality, so he'll
ruin things if he gets involved here.</font>

157
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,149
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

158
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,588
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you can't handle him
on your own, give me a call.</font>

159
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:42,893
<font color=#FFFF00>All right!
Have a great time with Hyun Soo!</font>

160
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,808
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he's in the lobby,
so where is he?</font>

161
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Where should we go first?</font>

162
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,309
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been here before?</font>

163
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course! Yeosu is famous
for its fermented soy crabs.</font>

164
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,470
<font color=#FFFF00>So you still only remember places
based on their food, I see.</font>

165
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:29,283
<font color=#FFFF00>How about I give you a feast
for your eyes before lunch?</font>

166
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, this is nice.</font>

167
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:42,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm hungry.</font>

168
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,234
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a bit out of the ordinary.</font>

169
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:47,489
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

170
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:49,785
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't expect that.</font>

171
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:55,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you's say something like,
"This view is so nice!"</font>

172
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:02,057
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you think to
come here with us?</font>

173
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,737
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I was bored?</font>

174
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:09,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Your appeal is that you're honest,
and your appeal just dropped.</font>

175
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,139
<font color=#FFFF00>From the number one spot?</font>

176
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,465
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez.</font>

177
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:15,135
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just go eat some
fermented soy crabs.</font>

178
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,303
<font color=#FFFF00>The best way to eat fermented soy crab</font>

179
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,955
<font color=#FFFF00>is to scrape it out of the shell
and eat it with rice!</font>

180
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:51,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You know the right way to eat it.</font>

181
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,784
<font color=#FFFF00>What other dishes is
Yeosu known for?</font>

182
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,846
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, this tastes amazing.</font>

183
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,596
<font color=#FFFF00>Put your glasses on.</font>

184
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:07,816
<font color=#FFFF00>People are supposed to look prettier
without their glasses, right?</font>

185
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,872
<font color=#FFFF00>But you look better with
yours on, Writer Hwangbo.</font>

186
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I make you feel bad?</font>

187
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,199
<font color=#FFFF00>You really hate hearing things
like that, don't you, Writer Hwangbo?</font>

188
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,578
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all, you didn't
make me feel bad.</font>

189
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,221
<font color=#FFFF00>And as for my glasses, I'll
wear them if I want to</font>

190
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:26,811
<font color=#FFFF00>and take them off
if I want to take them off.</font>

191
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,303
<font color=#FFFF00>But I want to keep them off right now
because of you, Director Kim.</font>

192
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:35,308
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay to just speak
your dialect.</font>

193
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:37,346
<font color=#FFFF00>You're trying so hard to
speak in the Seoul dialect.</font>

194
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:38,521
<font color=#FFFF00>It's pitiful to watch.</font>

195
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez, seriously!</font>

196
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:45,144
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not wrong.
You're right.</font>

197
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:47,449
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason I don't use my dialect
is because people can tell</font>

198
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,742
<font color=#FFFF00>exactly where I grew up just by how
I speak, so I'm trying to work on it.</font>

199
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I want to seem a bit
mysterious and such.</font>

200
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:58,799
<font color=#FFFF00>You wouldn't seem mysterious or anything
even if you used the Seoul dialect.</font>

201
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,282
<font color=#FFFF00>You're paying, right?</font>

202
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,979
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

203
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:06,035
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm holding back!</font>

204
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,787
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to focus on
just eating.</font>

205
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:16,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

206
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:19,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you dare do
things like that.</font>

207
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:21,923
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to be
close to you.</font>

208
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:32,790
<font color=#FFFF00>This is one of the
many rock crevices.</font>

209
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,717
<font color=#FFFF00>They say your wish will come true
if you pass through all seven of them.</font>

210
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say it out loud.
Just think it.</font>

211
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come up with a wish?</font>

212
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:43,861
<font color=#FFFF00>I did, too.
I'm off!</font>

213
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful.
Don't get lost.</font>

214
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:48,290
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no way I'd get lost here!</font>

215
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,794
<font color=#FFFF00>I even drive now!</font>

216
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:52,133
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a sense of direction now!</font>

219

Please read this.</font>

226
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you discussing a contract
with any other company?</font>

227
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:41,604
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm considering an offer that
On Entertainment's CEO Park made me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>On Entertainment is great.
And CEO Park is smart.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Director Min!</font>

230
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, hey.</font>

231
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,678
<font color=#FFFF00>You go ahead and get things ready.</font>

232
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:58,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going crazy because of the script.</font>

233
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,708
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you that getting new writers
would just drain you.</font>

234
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why you're
putting yourself through this.</font>

235
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,178
<font color=#FFFF00>It may be a bit too late, but
call Writer Lee Hyun Soo!</font>

236
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,939
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do that!</font>

237
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,962
<font color=#FFFF00>Not even if I bite my tongue and die!</font>

238
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:13,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh!</font>

239
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:15,206
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Director.</font>

240
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,831
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, hello.</font>

241
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:20,159

00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,126
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really?
Congratulations.</font>

243
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh yeah, since you're Writer Lee's
assistant writer</font>

244
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:29,663
<font color=#FFFF00>you know a lot about
"Foul Detective," don't you?</font>

245
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you help her come up
with the story?</font>

246
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,484
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, no. But I do know
the work well.</font>

247
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:38,722
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, then can you become
one of our writers?</font>

248
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you asking me to join
your writing team?</font>

249
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you understand exactly
what I meant, huh?</font>

250
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:50,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I get onto
a sinking ship?</font>

251
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,701
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow!</font>

252
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,885

254
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:02,038

our ship may not sink.</font>

255
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:03,475

work together next time too.</font>

257
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,400
<font color=#FFFF00>You still don't want to?</font>

258
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:25,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow.</font>

259
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,274

273
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,121
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Give up on me, then.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>I realized that fact
when it was too late.</i></font>

277
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:29,438
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That this is what it
feels like to be in love.</i></font>

278
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:32,372

<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault.</font>

283
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:32,893
<font color=#FFFF00>I ruined everything.</font>

284
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,414

00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:38,188
<font color=#FFFF00>that I ignored all of the signs
that you were giving me.</font>

286
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:46,711
<font color=#FFFF00>When I say "you," I don't mean "you."
I mean the other kind of "you."</font>

287
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,909
<font color=#FFFF00>You're concerned about that
at a time like this?</font>

288
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,374
<font color=#FFFF00>There are some things that need
clarifying, despite the circumstances!</font>

289
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:58,484
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, forget about thinking!</font>

290
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:02,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought and I thought, which
is what led me to lose you!</font>

291
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:06,016
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought about this a whole lot
while we were apart for five years.</font>

292
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,887
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you.</font>

293
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,951
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm in love with you.</font>

294
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

295
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:27,097
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no reason why a woman who
pushed you away once can't do it again.</font>

296
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:30,226
<font color=#FFFF00>Saying things like, "reality is always
difficult", is too harsh!</font>

297
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you've quoted me verbatim.</font>

298
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,180
<font color=#FFFF00>So how could you tell me
that you love me?</font>

299
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,497
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you tell me that
you thought only of me?</font>

300
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:40,530
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you, I have more
trouble with other things.</font>

301
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:43,306
<font color=#FFFF00>You did.</font>

302
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop talking.</font>

303
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,956
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be seeing you
next time, then.</font>

304
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,831
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[Chief Producer Yoo Hong Jin]</i></font>

305
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:23,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Chief Producer?</font>

306
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, CEO Park.</font>

307
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:29,448
<font color=#FFFF00>We have a great new condition
for our agreement.</font>

308
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,938
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

309
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:33,929
<font color=#FFFF00>You know Ms. Ji Hong Ah, right?
Writer Lee Hyun Soo's assistant writer.</font>

310
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:37,573
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

311
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,177
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it'd be good to kick out the
two writers we have now</font>

312
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,974
<font color=#FFFF00>and have Writer Ji take over.</font>

313
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,720
<font color=#FFFF00><i>She was on Writer Lee Hyun Soo's writing
team, so she knows the story well.</i></font>

314
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,675
<font color=#FFFF00>At this rate, "Foul Detective"
will be canceled early.</font>

315
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:50,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Then we'll incur huge losses.</font>

316
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:52,465
<font color=#FFFF00>We won't be able to sell the
rights overseas, either.</font>

317
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:04,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, Jung Woo.</font>

318
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:06,787
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you?</font>

319
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you done taking care of
your business?</font>

320
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,239
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, you can hang up.
I'll text you.</font>

321
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't Hyun Soo coming?</font>

322
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:17,676
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure she'll come
when the time is right.</font>

323
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,236
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she?
Tell her to come back.</font>

324
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:22,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she with someone else?</font>

325
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:24,766
<font color=#FFFF00>That's none of your business.</font>

326
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:26,951
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'll ask her where she is.</font>

327
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to read it?</font>

328
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:42,550
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to,
because I'm with you.</font>

329
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,230
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do anything
precisely because you're with me.</font>

330
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:53,825
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Where are you, Hyun Soo?</i></font>

331
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:56,759
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Kyung.
Should I tell her to come here?</font>

332
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,422
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to do that?</font>

333
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,151
<font color=#FFFF00>We came on this trip together</font>

334
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:02,428
<font color=#FFFF00>but I feel like I'm the only one
having a good time.</font>

335
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:04,715
<font color=#FFFF00>Do as you please.</font>

336
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Nah, I'll just meet up with her
when I get to the hotel.</font>

337
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:21,697
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hyun Soo said that she went to
the Soho Floating Bridge.</i></font>

338
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:24,349
<font color=#FFFF00><i>It'll be just like a movie
if you meet her there!</i></font>

339
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,843
<font color=#FFFF00>But why did Hyun Soo go to
that bridge by herself?</font>

340
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,602
<font color=#FFFF00>When did I say
that she went by herself?</font>

341
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:41,487
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not by herself?</font>

342
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:42,946
<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

343
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:46,150
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not there with a man, is she?</font>

344
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,399
<font color=#FFFF00>It is a man!</font>

345
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:50,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez, why are you
only telling me that now?</font>

346
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,036
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you just asked now!</font>

351
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, sorry. I made a mistake.
Hyun Soo isn't there.</font>

352
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:07,384
<font color=#FFFF00>Just come straight to the hotel.</font>

353
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:09,424
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

354
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,412
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

355
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:13,960
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll come here, right?</font>

356
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:19,073
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I should see the
Soho Floating Bridge while I'm here.</font>

357
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:35,588
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so nice.</font>

358
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,091
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not cold?</font>

359
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:42,014
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm fine.</font>

360
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think you'll be okay.</font>

361
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:57,316
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay even if
I'm not okay.</font>

362
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:42,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish that...</font>

363
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:45,539
