00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,113
[Episode 13]

2
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,778
Oh..!

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,709
Ooooooh...!

4
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,919
Ah!

5
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,476
Hey.

6
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,106
Hey.

7
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:31,506
Are you asleep?

8
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:35,206
Why that annoying...

9
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:39,206
Whatever.

10
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,776
Why is she so heavy?

11
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:10,606
Sir!

12
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,646
You can't just go.

13
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:14,646
You need to pay first.

14
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:15,876
Excuse me?

15
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,146
Here!

16
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,176
Ma'am!

17
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:32,706
Yun Shil, please wake up.

18
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:37,106
You need to tell me where
you live so I can take you.

19
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:45,506
She's just incredible.

20
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:58,476
My back.

21
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:01,546
Hold on.

22
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:07,376
I think I heard that she
lives in Ms Geum's building.

23
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:09,146
(Ms Geum)

24
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:12,806
The phone has been turned off...

25
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,776
Why is her phone off?

26
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:19,176
Hey.

27
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,276
Hey, Yun Shil. Wake up.

28
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,146
She isn't asleep. She's
practically passed out.

29
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:36,476
Darn it.

30
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,776
She looks skinny.

31
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:46,876
Why is she so heavy?

32
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,706
Is something wrong with her?

33
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:59,806
The family will think something is up.

34
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,406
Hey, Yun Shil.

35
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,306
Wake up, will you?

36
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,746
You're pretending to be asleep
to mess with me, aren't you?

37
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:21,446
Wake up, will you?

38
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,306
This is insane.

39
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,176
I'm home.

40
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,846
Why are you out here in the cold?

41
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:46,906
I'm too angry to sit inside.

42
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:48,606
Why? What happened now?

43
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,376
Let's talk inside.

44
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,906
I saw your wife this afternoon.

45
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,905
Why did you do that?

46
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:14,346
I wanted to talk some sense into her,

47
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,646
but she wouldn't listen at
all and lashed out at me.

48
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,245
What do you mean?

49
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,346
She says you're a losing lottery ticket.

50
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:24,176
She bought you thinking
you'd win the jackpot,

51
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,376
but you turned out to be a bust.

52
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,146
She said she relied on you,

53
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:33,606
but you disappointed her,
so she can't live with you.

54
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,216
That wicked brat.

55
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,046
She loses all rationality
when she doesn't get her way.

56
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,406
I realised...

57
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,946
my baby must have suffered all these years,

58
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:48,246
putting up with that wicked temper.

59
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:58,306
My heart was aching and
breaking all day long.

60
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:01,216
It's all in the past.

61
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:02,676
A spouse...

62
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:07,576
is supposed to be a person
you can depend on for life.

63
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:12,046
If you don't get along,
you should break up.

64
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:15,876
I'm not that unreasonable,

65
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,046
so do what you want.

66
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,476
Okay?

67
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:22,746
Okay. I'm sorry for worrying you.

68
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,646
You make me write an apology
letter and bring you honey water.

69
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,406
You're treating me like a slave.

70
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:39,506
You're out of control.

71
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:44,906
I drank because...

72
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:48,345
I thought I'd cause trouble if I didn't.

73
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,905
So stop nagging, little Sam Do.

74
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,106
Little Sam Do?

75
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:55,146
I'm your husband, not a kid.

76
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:57,146
You've totally lost it.

77
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,276
Tell me the truth.

78
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:02,906
If I go to jail,

79
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:06,276
will you remain true to
me until I get released?

80
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,976
You'll pretend to work out
and show off your muscles,

81
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,606
show your dashing smile,

82
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,876
flirt and date around, won't you?

83
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:19,106
I'm so stunned, I'm speechless.

84
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,906
See? You can't answer me.

85
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,176
If I end up in jail,

86
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:27,876
you'll jump for joy and thank the stars.

87
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,246
Right? Answer me.

88
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:32,976
- First, go to jail.
- What?

89
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:36,606
That way, I can cheat or get
married again or something.

90
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:40,746
I know you can't trust anyone,

91
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,676
but how can you do this to me?

92
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,845
I've lived for you...

93
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,946
and sold the chicken shop
and followed you to Seoul.

94
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,706
How could you do this to me?

95
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:56,075
My gosh. My gosh. My gosh.

96
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,375
You pathetic woman.

97
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,876
If you're drunk, go to sleep.
Stop being stupid.

98
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:05,306
Then swear to me...

99
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:08,246
that you'll be true to
me until I get released.

100
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:10,446
Fine, I will.

101
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:14,076
I, Sam Do, will be true to Sun Nyeo
until the day I die. Happy now?

102
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:15,876
No flexing your muscles.

103
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:18,976
You're so annoying. Fine! I won't!

104
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:20,646
You'd better...

105
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,776
- You'd better not.
- My goodness.

106
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,346
What a mess.

107
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:33,006
I'm going to change first.

108
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:34,976
It's too hot.

109
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,406
He's struggling with writing
music and I'm of no help.

110
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,006
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:08,576
I should've gotten a fat
alimony when I got divorced.

112
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:20,946
How is she?

113
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,305
She just fell asleep.

114
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:24,876
She must be very angry at Mum and me.

115
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:29,306
In her opinion, she thought she
was family and fought for you,

116
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,546
so she's shocked at what happened.

117
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:34,376
I've talked to Mum several times
about the written apology,

118
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:35,882
but she flipped out.

119
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,746
Of course. Think of her age.

120
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,746
Eun Sook was out of line.

121
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:41,376
What should we do?

122
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:44,336
I heard she has to go to the police
for questioning in two days.

123
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:46,276
We'll think of something.

124
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:50,746
Anyway, why did Leather
Jacket get plastered?

125
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:54,106
He's looking for investors
to release his second album,

126
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:55,976
but it must be difficult.

127
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,246
Let me say this just in case,

128
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,276
but don't you fall for his
tricks and invest in him.

129
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:04,675
Come on. He isn't like that.

130
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,206
Hey. Money lies, not people.

131
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,976
Don't get soft and fall
for punks like that.

132
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,176
I don't even have money to
pay rent for the store.

133
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,406
Stop worrying.

134
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:16,076
I'm leaving.

135
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:18,376
Heed my warning, okay?

136
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,676
That punk.

137
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,676
Look at him sleeping.

138
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,476
He's so annoying.

139
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:49,576
Hey.

140
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:51,846
Yun Shil.

141
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,276
Hey, Bucket Head!

142
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:59,576
I can't leave her here all night.
What should I do?

143
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:04,276
Darn it.

144
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,506
You're home late.

145
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,846
- Did you eat?
- I did.

146
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,406
How's working at the tailor shop?

147
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:16,646
It's just the beginning.

148
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,506
You must be tired. Wash up and go to bed.

149
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:19,706
Dong Sook.

150
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,406
I was expecting a package today.

151
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:25,446
A package? Nothing came.

152
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:29,276
I'm sure I told them to leave
it in front of the gate.

153
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,046
I didn't see anything.

154
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:32,346
I'll check.

155
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:33,576
Okay.

156
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,546
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

157
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,346
What's wrong with her?

158
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:45,006
Yun Shil. Yun Shil. Wake up. Yun Shil!

159
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,506
- Dong Jin!
- Yes?

160
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:52,046
Look who this is.

161
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:53,376
Isn't this Yun Shil?

162
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,906
Yes. I came to look for the package,

163
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,846
and she was passed out here.

164
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:00,006
What? Why that...

165
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,806
Let's bring her inside.

166
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:03,006
Okay.

167
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,006
Dong Sook. Get some drinks.

168
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,075
- What?
- It seems like...

169
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,575
this is a night for the women
of our family to drink.

170
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:22,645
We should have some, too.

171
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,306
I'm really going to get the drinks.

172
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:29,376
Why did Yun Shil drink so much?

173
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:34,406
Her husband is in prison, and she
was fired from the tailor shop.

174
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,306
Who can blame her for being upset?

175
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:37,706
You're right.

176
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:40,306
Why did you fire someone
who was working hard?

177
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:43,506
You were completely in the wrong, Dong Jin.

178
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:47,176
If she got drunk, why didn't she go home?

179
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,346
Why was she passed out
in front of our gate?

180
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:50,846
I know.

181
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:53,106
I'm tired, so I'm going to bed.

182
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,806
- Good night.
- Okay.

183
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,206
She says you're a losing lottery ticket.

184
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:13,306
She bought you thinking
you'd win the jackpot,

185
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,576
but you turned out to be a bust.

186
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,306
A losing lottery ticket?

187
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,376
Hi.

188
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:27,946
Don't forget we're going to court tomorrow.

189
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,576
What? Did you think I'd forget?

190
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,846
Just in case.

191
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:34,576
I was worried that you'd be
focused in making suits...

192
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:37,206
that you might lose track of time.

193
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:38,746
That's why I wanted to check.

194
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:39,846
Don't worry.

195
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:43,776
I've been waiting for this day
too, almost as much as you have.

196
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,576
- What?
- I'll see you in court.

197
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,676
"I've been waiting for this day
too, almost as much as you have"?

198
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,576
Jerk.

199
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:10,706
Hey, Miss!

200
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:13,846
Miss!

201
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:17,106
What is it? Is something wrong?

202
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:19,006
Send these to my in-laws.

203
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:20,805
Mr Lee's clothes? All of them?

204
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:23,106
Don't leave a single
underwear or sock behind.

205
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,706
Get rid of them all.

206
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,846
Look at that temper.

207
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,246
What a brat.

208
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:48,546
That jerk.

209
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:54,276
Hyo Won, are you still sleeping?

210
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:04,046
Goodness.

211
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,446
She must have been tired.

212
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:15,446
She's asleep already.

213
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,806
I wonder which one is his girlfriend.

214
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:47,406
Then who was the person that
was with me during surgery?

215
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,246
Are you Mr Kang Tae Yang?

216
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:55,776
Yes, I am.

217
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,146
Hello. We're from Hangook Life.

218
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,476
How are you feeling?

219
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:00,846
I'm better.

220
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:04,576
The accident was caused by
one of our policy holders,

221
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,946
so we came to resolve the matter.

222
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:13,446
I will cut through the chase.

223
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,205
If you decide to take this to court,

224
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,776
it will cost both you and
us a lot of time and money.

225
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,876
Why don't you take our settlement
offer and settle out of court?

226
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,076
(Hangook Life)

227
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:49,876
Sorry.

228
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,406
I forgot I had urgent work to take care of.

229
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,306
I'm okay. You should get to work.

230
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:56,506
Okay.

231
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,306
You know where she lives, right?
Take her home.

232
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:00,546
Yes, Sir.

233
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:01,946
I'll call later.

234
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,576
It's really big.

235
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:21,476
Just how big it it?

236
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:24,646
Shall we go?

237
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,206
Okay.

238
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:12,516
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
I must have lost my mind.

239
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:15,776
Who is it?

240
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:21,746
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you in here?

241
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:24,746
Are you insane?

242
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,206
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

243
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,946
Dong Jin, are you up?

244
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,706
- Yes, Mother.
- I'm coming in.

245
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,276
What do I do?

246
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,576
I made kale and apple juice. Have some.

247
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,206
I will. Please put it there.

248
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,946
I'm so tired. Let me sleep
for five more minutes.

249
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,806
Okay. Sure.

250
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,246
But...

251
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,706
why do you look like that?

252
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:09,576
- What?
- You look yellow.

253
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:11,646
What's wrong?

254
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,376
What? Oh, actually,

255
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:15,646
it's probably because I didn't sleep well.

256
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:19,376
Sure. How could you sleep well?

257
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,206
Drink this, okay?

258
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,406
I will.

259
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:35,845
I'm so, so sorry. Please
forgive me this once.

260
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:39,146
If my mother saw you in here,
she would've had a stroke.

261
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,946
I know. But I didn't do it on purpose.

262
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,016
I was just too drunk and...

263
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:48,046
I have no excuse.

264
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,016
Bad things happen when we're together,

265
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:52,476
so let's not meet as
much as possible, okay?

266
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:54,406
Okay. Okay, Of course.

267
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,106
Get out. Now.

268
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,376
But...

269
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:13,206
are you the one who brought
me here, Gargoyle...

270
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:15,876
Mr Lee?

271
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:19,746
I blacked out last night,
so I don't remember at all.

272
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,176
Why would I bring you home?

273
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:23,876
Stop the nonsense and get out.

274
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:26,476
Okay. I'll get out. I'm leaving.

275
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,806
You're sure...

276
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:34,076
you didn't carry me here, right?

277
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:36,046
I have better things to do.

278
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,876
Stop the nonsense and get out of my sight.

279
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:53,106
I can't like her even if I try.

280
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,446
I'm going to lose my mind.

281
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:09,945
Hi, Dong Sook.

282
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,476
Where are you? Mum's looking
for you to have breakfast.

283
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:14,806
I'm on my way home.

284
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,746
I'm really sorry for last night.

285
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,276
Okay.

286
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,076
Yun Shil is on her way home.

287
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:26,176
I made bean sprout soup to help with
the hangover. Why did she leave?

288
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:28,546
She has to make deliveries
and she probably felt bad...

289
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,376
and rushed out.

290
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:34,076
What is there to feel bad about?
She's family.

291
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:35,476
But Mum,

292
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:39,146
may I bring some of the
soup upstairs as well?

293
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:40,776
Why?

294
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:42,746
Do you want to bring it to Sung Jun?

295
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:43,946
Mum!

296
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,846
No, that's not it.

297
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:48,046
You were quite a sight last night.

298
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,646
The way you were helping that
drunk Leather Jacket home...

299
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,976
You practically looked like his wife.

300
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:54,476
You can never be with him. Never.

301
00:21:54,676 --> 00:21:56,376
It's not like that.

302
00:21:56,676 --> 00:22:00,976
I'm just helping him as a good neighbour.

303
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,576
You said it. You're just
neighbours, got it?

304
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,575
If you change your tune later,
I'll shave your head...

305
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:10,076
and put a leash around your
neck and send you to a temple.

306
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,646
The soup is so good.

307
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,976
What a sight.

308
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:32,406
What are you doing?

309
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:34,076
What else? I'm setting the table.

310
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:36,676
Did you make the bean sprout soup yourself?

311
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:39,806
No. Ms Choi sent it up...

312
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,176
for the brother and sister.

313
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:43,546
- Brother and sister?
- Brother and sister?

314
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:44,876
Don't you remember?

315
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:47,536
I heard you decided to
become brother and sister.

316
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:50,946
- Us?
- You were arm-in-arm,

317
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:53,276
singing at the top of your lungs
walking through the neighbourhood...

318
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,106
about Susanna's handkerchief
or foot towel or something.

319
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,646
What's Susanna's foot towel?

320
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:59,846
Not foot towel. Handkerchief.
I taught you last night.

321
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,576
I need to get to work,

322
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:07,106
so the brother and sister can eat together.

323
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,646
We should eat first.

324
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:19,776
Susanna

325
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:23,006
I will be

326
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:24,976
By your side

327
00:23:25,176 --> 00:23:29,306
I won't let you go

328
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,346
Let us

329
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,546
You're making me lose my appetite.

330
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,646
Sung Jun, the Best New
Artist of the year 2000.

331
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:39,945
Rock ballad's Terius with
outstanding singing skills...

332
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,406
and a heart-wrenching voice.

333
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:44,306
You'll hit the jackpot if you invest in me.

334
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,506
Look.

335
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:48,245
I'm going to the police
tomorrow for questioning...

336
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:50,706
and am going to jail. I can't invest.

337
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:54,406
Come on, Sun Nyeo, my sister.

338
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,146
Why am I your sister?

339
00:23:58,246 --> 00:23:59,746
He said we became
brother-and-sister last night.

340
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:02,646
I don't remember any of
that, so eat quietly.

341
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,246
I won't charge you for breakfast today.

342
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,106
Come on.

343
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,346
Okay, I'll eat.

344
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:14,806
Darn it.

345
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,776
That tastes good.

346
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,476
Madam will be right out.

347
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:34,746
What a palace.

348
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:39,576
Hi.

349
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:43,475
How long has it been, Sam Do?

350
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,676
I'm sorry for not keeping in touch.

351
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:56,176
Oh, my gosh. How did you
know I like cosmos flowers?

352
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:58,576
How could I not? We spent
so many years together.

353
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:02,145
Whenever the tailor shop was closed,
you and I would take the train...

354
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:04,576
and walk along the tracks
surrounded by cosmos flowers.

355
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:08,206
That's right. We did.

356
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:09,506
But Eun Sook,

357
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,276
do you...

358
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:13,776
eat preservatives instead of rice?

359
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:17,176
- What?
- How are you exactly the same?

360
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:22,476
You're so good at saying
things you don't mean.

361
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:24,006
What do you mean?

362
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,506
You know I never lie, even
with a gun to my head.

363
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:29,476
Have a seat.

364
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:33,976
What would you like to drink?

365
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,046
Oh, my gosh.

366
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:38,976
What are you doing?

367
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:44,176
Please save a life. Please forgive my wife.

368
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,406
Because I'm an incompetent husband,

369
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:50,876
she had to provide for us
ever since she was young...

370
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,946
and ran a fried chicken place.

371
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:55,846
She has a tender heart inside,

372
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:59,176
but she became rough and stubborn
because of her loser husband.

373
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:02,406
She must have a lot of rage in her.
She gets angry easily...

374
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:04,376
and acts with her fist first.

375
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:07,746
Sam Do, you poor thing.

376
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,246
To be honest,

377
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:13,246
I wasn't going to report her to the police.

378
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:18,146
I got angry because Ms Choi kept
disrespecting me and yelling at me.

379
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:21,346
So let's forget about the
written apology. Okay?

380
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,946
But...

381
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,006
I have one condition.

382
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:27,106
A condition?

383
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,146
After what she did,

384
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,846
of course, she couldn't come back here.

385
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,076
Is anyone in?

386
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:56,576
Welcome to Wolgyesu. How may I help you?

387
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,676
Is Yun Shil not in yet?

388
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:03,946
Yun Shil left the company not long ago.

389
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:08,206
There she is. Yun Shil!

390
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,276
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

391
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:14,806
What brings you here?

392
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:18,646
My grandson tore his uniform
while playing soccer.

393
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,176
I need to stitch it up for
him, but I just can't see.

394
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,946
Would you use that sewing machine
and stitch it up for me?

395
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,846
Of course, I will.

396
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:32,846
May I use the sewing machine?

397
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:34,906
It'll only take three minutes.

398
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:38,676
Fine.

399
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:08,206
- It's all done.
- Let me see.

400
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:10,346
My goodness.

401
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:13,446
You can't tell at all.

402
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:16,546
Here, take this.

403
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:19,776
It's okay. I can't charge you for that.

404
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:23,946
I just feel bad, that's all.

405
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:27,076
It's okay, so let's go.

406
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:28,846
Okay. Let's go.

407
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:30,906
Sir.

408
00:28:31,246 --> 00:28:33,246
You'll be blessed.

409
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:44,306
Bring these to your grandson.

410
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:48,206
It's okay. You wouldn't even let
me pay for fixing the pants.

411
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:51,476
He needs to eat well to
have energy to study hard.

412
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:55,206
You're always so nice. I feel so bad.

413
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:58,546
It's because you remind me
of my late grandmother.

414
00:29:00,276 --> 00:29:03,776
It's because I want to, so don't feel bad.

415
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,976
- Thank you.
- That busy-body.

416
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:09,106
- My gosh.
- Drink them with your grandson.

417
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,006
Okay. Thank you very much.

418
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,246
Great.

419
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:14,676
My gosh.

420
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,106
Thank you. Come again.

421
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:27,376
Hi, Tae Yang. How do you feel?

422
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,676
Hold on.

423
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:31,676
Here you go.

424
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:33,846
Thank you for settling.

425
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:36,806
We've given you the most we could.

426
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:39,206
- We wish you a quick recovery.
- Thank you.

427
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:51,006
Sorry. I had some visitors.

428
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:52,976
Who? Ji Yun?

429
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:54,706
Why would she come here?

430
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,006
But Yun Shil,

431
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:57,976
I'm rich now.

432
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,376
What do you mean?

433
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,046
I can pay off my student
loan and two months rent.

434
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:07,446
What are you talking about?
Did money fall from the sky?

435
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:10,906
The insurance company
gave me money to settle.

436
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,576
Oh, so that's what you mean.

437
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:16,246
"Who knew it was so easy to make money?"

438
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:20,476
"One more accident, and I can
have money in my bank account."

439
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,976
I keep having bad thoughts like this.

440
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:29,406
I'm so pathetic.

441
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:32,976
(Balance 10,385 dollars)

442
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:41,976
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

443
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:44,176
Don't lie. Give it to me.

444
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,746
- Stop.
- Give it.

445
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,046
Isn't this a bank book?

446
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:49,946
My savings matured.

447
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,906
- How much?
- 10,000 dollars!

448
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:57,506
Oh, my gosh.

449
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:00,206
I'm so proud of my daughter.

450
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,006
I'm going to use this as seed money...

451
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,576
and open my own hair salon in 10 years.

452
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:09,106
You're better than your mum.

453
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:15,776
How did I give birth to someone so smart?

454
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,146
You cute thing.

455
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:29,046
Stop that, will you?

456
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,406
I just want to help my sister.
Don't stop me.

457
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:34,306
You can kiss up all you want.

458
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:38,576
You won't get a penny from me,
so don't waste your time.

459
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:42,976
If you're locked up in prison, you
won't be able make money at all.

460
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:47,976
Just invest 50,000 dollars in me,
and I'll multiply that by 10.

461
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:51,376
By the time you're released, your 50,000...

462
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:54,576
- would've jumped to 500,000.
- Seriously...

463
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,376
Are you trying to anger me?

464
00:31:57,946 --> 00:31:58,946
What?

465
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,546
- What are you doing?
- Are you?

466
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:03,406
- Are you trying to anger me?
- Why are you throwing salt at me?

467
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,476
I'm angry as it is.

468
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,276
What are you doing?

469
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:10,276
What are you doing?

470
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,046
What's the ruckus?

471
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:17,176
Oh, my goodness.

472
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:19,546
Why are you making so much kimchi?

473
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,046
Sam Do needs to eat...

474
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:23,006
while I'm in prison.

475
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,006
You're going overboard.

476
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,946
You haven't even undergone
police investigation.

477
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,646
Why do you keep talking about jail?

478
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,776
It's easy for you to say.

479
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:35,246
Why are you doing that to yourself?

480
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,306
I told you not to worry.

481
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:39,576
Sure. Sure.

482
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:43,376
While I'm eating cold rice
in a cold prison cell,

483
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:46,246
you and Dong Sook can
sit in your warm room,

484
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:48,706
eating hot rice and...

485
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:52,846
the kimchi that I make.
Knock yourselves out.

486
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:54,446
Why that...

487
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:56,446
I'm going to work.

488
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,576
Don't you dare go near this man.

489
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,406
Okay.

490
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,905
I'll see you later, Grandma.

491
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:04,376
- Okay.
- Bye.

492
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:06,376
Are you working the afternoon shift today?

493
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:13,476
She is so cold. She isn't
like her mum at all.

494
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:17,406
Why are you home at this hour?

495
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:20,006
Ms Choi, I need to talk
to you about something.

496
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:21,506
Let's go in.

497
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:27,706
Sit down and continue what you were doing.

498
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,546
Let's make kimchi.

499
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:39,346
Fine. I'll stop.

500
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:41,376
I left the stove on.

501
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,576
- Is it ready?
- Yes, of course.

502
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:56,376
You wait here.

503
00:33:57,506 --> 00:33:58,876
- Let's go.
- Yes, Ma'am.

504
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:04,976
Are you okay?

505
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:08,106
Be careful.

506
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:12,806
Oh, my gosh. Look who's here?

507
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,545
What brings you here, Madam?

508
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:16,046
What else?

509
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,806
Sam Do came this morning
and begged profusely,

510
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:21,776
so I came for his sake.

511
00:34:22,046 --> 00:34:24,446
My husband went to see you?

512
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,416
You got yourself a good husband.

513
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,376
- Where's Ms Choi?
- She's in her room.

514
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:34,776
Ms Choi! Please come out! You
have an important guest!

515
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,106
Hi, Eun Sook.

516
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:42,076
Is she inside?

517
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,706
Yes. Come in.

518
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:45,646
- Let's go in.
- Yes, Ma'am.

519
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:48,776
Oh, my goodness.

520
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,106
Hold on.

521
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,046
Careful.

522
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,276
You went to see her?

523
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:06,876
I had no idea.

524
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:10,076
You're the best.

525
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,646
I'll grill up some eel tonight.

526
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:16,246
You crazy woman. This is
no time to talk about eel.

527
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:30,876
Hi, Eun Sook.

528
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,706
Long time no see.

529
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:35,046
I'm here.

530
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,306
Mum, Eun Sook is here.

531
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,376
Sit down.

532
00:35:49,476 --> 00:35:50,806
Who is he?

533
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,446
He's our lawyer.

534
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,176
It's not some big case. Why
did you bring your lawyer?

535
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:57,576
Because of...

536
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:00,346
your history together, Ms Ko has offered...

537
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:03,876
to drop the charges against
Ms Bok Sun Nyeo...

538
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:06,806
if Ms Choi would write an
affidavit with an apology.

539
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:09,206
Then you won't need to
be punished by the law.

540
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:10,506
Really?

541
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:13,376
It went from a written
apology to an affidavit.

542
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:15,482
Thank you so much.

543
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,946
You are very lucky.

544
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:21,446
It is because Ms Ko is
very kind and giving...

545
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,876
that you're getting off this easily.

546
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,306
Why don't you open your eyes?

547
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,776
Yes, Mum.

548
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:36,915
Just write it for her
and put an end to this.

549
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:40,746
Yes, Ms Choi. You shouldn't
drag these things out.

550
00:36:41,276 --> 00:36:42,706
Stop it.

551
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:48,846
I can't write an affidavit and
offer it to you at my age.

552
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,475
I'll say it, so you can write it down...

553
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,576
or listen as you wish.

554
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,376
This isn't what was promised.

555
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:59,946
She's right, Eun Sook.

556
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:02,976
Let's end it nicely here.

557
00:37:03,446 --> 00:37:06,876
It'll be bad for both parties
if you drag this out.

558
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:09,546
Okay. Fine.

559
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:12,846
But everyone leave other than Mr Choi.

560
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:14,776
That's not right.

561
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:18,746
One of us should remain, too.

562
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:21,916
Then Sam Do, you stay.

563
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:36,806
Hi, Dong Jin.

564
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,676
It's Dong Sook. Can you come home?

565
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:41,176
Why? What is it now?

566
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:45,546
Your mother-in-law... I
mean, Eun Sook is here.

567
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,846
She wants Mum to write an affidavit.

568
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:50,706
I think you should be here.

569
00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:52,306
Okay. I'll be right there.

570
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:56,146
I need to go home for a bit.

571
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:57,346
Okay.

572
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:03,746
Ever since Mr Lee left home,

573
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:06,146
they've never been at peace.

574
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,476
You just have to read this
as sincerely as you can.

575
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:21,546
I'll begin recording.

576
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,076
Wait, wait, wait.

577
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:30,206
I can't go ahead with it. I
can't put Ms Choi through this.

578
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:33,416
Just throw my wife in prison
if that's what's needed.

579
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:34,946
Let's end it all right here.

580
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,576
This is nothing.

581
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:39,876
It's fine. I'll read and be over with it.

582
00:38:40,076 --> 00:38:41,806
Apologise sincerely.

583
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:48,706
Why is this so complicated?

584
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:50,916
"I, Choi Gok Ji,"

585
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:53,846
"on October 8, 2016,"

586
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:57,276
"apologise sincerely to Ko Eun Sook..."

587
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:01,846
"for the assault I've caused."

588
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:06,076
"I swear that nothing of the
sort will happen again."

589
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,246
(Choi Gok Ji)

590
00:39:20,446 --> 00:39:21,946
Thank you, Ms Choi.

591
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:24,705
Is that it?

592
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:28,276
- No. Promise me one more thing.
- What?

593
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:31,146
Mr Choi and Sam Do, can you excuse us?

594
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:32,346
Yes, Ma'am.

595
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:47,506
What happened?

596
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,646
She signed the affidavit.

597
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:52,006
They wanted to talk in private.

598
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:56,376
I'd hide in a hole if there was one.

599
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:57,746
Is there one?

600
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,576
I want you to...

601
00:40:01,176 --> 00:40:03,246
promise me that you'll never mention...

602
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:04,916
Gok Nam again.

603
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:07,476
What did you say?

604
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:11,146
I turn 60 soon, and my son's
old enough to get married.

605
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:14,076
You scream at me because of
what happened years ago.

606
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:16,176
It's stressing me out.

607
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:18,146
How can you say that...

608
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:22,075
when my only brother died
early because of you?

609
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:25,146
I told you time and again
that it wasn't my fault.

610
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,946
He was the one who waited
outside my room so late...

611
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,545
and got in an accident.

612
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:34,646
Just because you can speak, doesn't
mean you can say nonsense.

613
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:36,746
Then...

614
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:38,746
shall I delete this?

615
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,946
Hello again. It's been a while.

616
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:52,506
What are you doing here?

617
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,206
Why are you here?

618
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:58,946
That's the home of the CEO of
the tailor store I work at.

619
00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:00,806
Oh, I see.

620
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:04,446
I was just there on business.

621
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:07,506
Do you deliver milk?

622
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:12,646
It's almost over. Hang in
there just a bit longer.

623
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:15,416
Your husband will be sentenced soon.

624
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:16,746
Yes.

625
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:20,075
Mr Min Hyo Sang is doing all
he can for your husband.

626
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:22,876
He'll only get about six months.

627
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:25,146
The prosecutor won't appeal.

628
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:31,006
Once your husband's released,
he'll become a store manager.

629
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:33,206
You won't have to deliver milk...

630
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:37,246
and people will call you
"Ma'am" out of respect.

631
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:41,576
So that was it.

632
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:44,346
You gave me an expensive
handbag with a wad of cheques,

633
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:47,806
and you bribed Gi Pyo with the
prospect of owning a store.

634
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,445
How could you say that?
We didn't bribe anyone.

635
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:56,045
Why is Mr Min doing so much
to help my husband then?

636
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:59,145
- That's because...
- You wanted my boss' son gone.

637
00:41:59,146 --> 00:42:02,645
Do you think I don't know
that's why you used him?

638
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,805
You people are really rotten.

639
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:08,806
Gi Pyo broke the law, so
he deserves to do time,

640
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:12,946
but my boss' son had nothing to do with it.

641
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:22,346
I won't settle for anything below one
million, so don't do this again.

642
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:26,416
Lady.

643
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:30,476
Only Mr Min can help your husband now.

644
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,646
You haven't been playing nice,
but it won't do him any good.

645
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:37,276
Did you just threaten me?

646
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:41,706
It's not a threat. It's advice.
You need to face reality.

647
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:56,146
- Hello.
- Hey.

648
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:05,146
Did you have a nice chat?

649
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:07,145
Yes. I guess.

650
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:10,416
I was making kimchi. It'll
ripen in a few days.

651
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:12,276
Shall I bring you some, Madam?

652
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:13,546
Yes.

653
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:15,706
If you wish.

654
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:26,846
We meet again.

655
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,346
- Hello.
- Are you going to court today?

656
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:31,416
- Yes.
- I tried...

657
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,746
talking to Hyo Joo, but you
know she never listens to me.

658
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:38,446
It's best you get over the
past and start fresh.

659
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:41,906
Don't try to be so nice when it's
your fault they got divorced.

660
00:43:43,546 --> 00:43:45,006
Goodbye, Ms Choi.

661
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:48,176
Goodbye.

662
00:43:50,846 --> 00:43:53,106
What a witch.

663
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:56,346
- My goodness.
- There!

664
00:43:58,046 --> 00:44:01,576
"I was making kimchi. Shall
I bring you some, Madam?"

665
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:03,146
Isn't that what you said?

666
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,076
I did it to survive, okay?

667
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:09,746
It's better to grovel and
brown-nose than end up behind bars.

668
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:11,546
Is Mum inside?

669
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:12,746
Yes.

670
00:44:19,446 --> 00:44:23,576
I'm so sorry I had to put
you though that, Ms Choi.

671
00:44:23,906 --> 00:44:25,276
Don't say that.

672
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:29,306
All sorts of things happen
when you live long enough.

673
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:36,476
Ms Choi.

674
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:39,946
Here's a sedative. Chew it
well before swallowing.

675
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:41,446
Are you teasing her?

676
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:44,206
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:44,506 --> 00:44:47,276
You should get a vitamin IV drip and rest.

678
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:50,246
I don't need an IV drip.
You can all leave now.

679
00:44:50,746 --> 00:44:52,906
I'll be fine after a nap.

680
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:12,806
Could you tell me who signed
the form for my surgery?

681
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:14,176
Just a moment.

682
00:45:20,506 --> 00:45:21,546
Here you go.

683
00:45:22,246 --> 00:45:23,246
Thanks.

684
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:25,006
(Surgery Consent Form)

685
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,876
(Min Hyo Won)

686
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:28,306
"Min Hyo Won"?

687
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:31,546
Who is that?

688
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:51,146
Why do I keep thinking of them?

689
00:45:53,706 --> 00:45:57,076
It's so annoying. It's really annoying.

690
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:05,506
Hello?

691
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:07,776
Is that Min Hyo Won's number?

692
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:11,346
It is. I'm she. Who's calling?

693
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:12,946
I'm Kang Tae Yang.

694
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:19,846
Hello?

695
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:26,676
Yes. I'm listening.

696
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:31,846
You signed the consent form for my surgery.
I got curious.

697
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:34,846
Do you know me?

698
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:37,406
Yes. I know you very well.

699
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:39,376
You know me very well?

700
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:43,076
You'll recognise me the second you see me.

701
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:44,706
Let's not just talk.

702
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:47,106
We should meet up.

703
00:46:50,646 --> 00:46:51,876
Let me see.

704
00:46:56,806 --> 00:46:59,246
Yun Shil found the exact fabric we needed.

705
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:03,246
She knows Dongdaemun Market
like the back of her hand.

706
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:06,246
Where is she? I'd like
to treat her to lunch.

707
00:47:06,346 --> 00:47:08,046
She has an interview.

708
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:09,706
An interview?

709
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:13,776
A tailor store she applied to asked
her to come for an interview.

710
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:14,976
Which store?

711
00:47:16,846 --> 00:47:20,246
Someone might not be happy
to hear this again,

712
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:23,106
but Yun Shil is irreplaceable.

713
00:47:23,546 --> 00:47:25,946
See how she found the exact fabric we need?

714
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,646
That's what I've always been saying.

715
00:47:27,776 --> 00:47:30,106
It's such a loss.

716
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:45,806
Yun Shil.

717
00:47:47,206 --> 00:47:48,576
Where are you going?

718
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:50,776
To a job interview. Why?

719
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:54,646
I can't believe you're going to
an interview looking like that.

720
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,946
Your cheeks are flaming red.

721
00:47:57,676 --> 00:48:00,046
No one into fashion would want to hire you.

722
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:01,176
What?

723
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:04,446
You obviously won't get the job.
Forget about it.

724
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:06,076
What a jerk.

725
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:15,206
Tell me if you fail.

726
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,576
I'll find you a job.

727
00:48:18,406 --> 00:48:21,176
Are you praying that I don't get hired?

728
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:22,476
That's just mean.

729
00:48:25,146 --> 00:48:27,106
Ouch. That hurt.

730
00:48:38,976 --> 00:48:40,446
How dare he...

731
00:48:40,676 --> 00:48:42,076
What a scumbag.

732
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:51,946
You sewed by hand...

733
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:54,646
and with a machine at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.

734
00:48:54,946 --> 00:48:56,046
Yes.

735
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:59,876
The Wolgyesu Tailor Shop
run by Mr Lee Man Sool?

736
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,576
That's the one.

737
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,976
I learned from Mr Lee in person.

738
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:07,575
He taught me in detail how
to cut and sew cloth...

739
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:08,746
Too bad.

740
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:11,576
We don't do things like he does.

741
00:49:11,976 --> 00:49:15,276
We don't make the suits here by hand.

742
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:18,206
We only take measurements and
design the suit for the factory.

743
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:21,106
Do you not make the suits in person?

744
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:23,476
We can't make a profit that way.

745
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:37,046
What use is a tailor store
that doesn't make suits?

746
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:02,176
Darling.

747
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:06,676
You aren't surprised. Where's Dong Jin?

748
00:50:07,276 --> 00:50:08,306
In court.

749
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:11,406
Right. To finalise his divorce?

750
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:12,906
You should be careful.

751
00:50:13,106 --> 00:50:14,106
Of what?

752
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:18,006
You'll end up in the same court
if you keep getting into trouble.

753
00:50:19,006 --> 00:50:21,345
If I hadn't gone and begged
Eun Sook this morning,

754
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:26,076
the police would question you and
cart you right off to prison.

755
00:50:26,576 --> 00:50:29,006
That's why I'm so grateful
for what you did.

756
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:32,476
I bought you some fresh eel.

757
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,475
I'll marinade it nicely and
grill it up for dinner.

758
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:37,075
Eat it on your own.

759
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:41,546
I have to work night and day to
get this suit ready for fitting.

760
00:50:42,246 --> 00:50:44,806
- I'm suspicious.
- About that?

761
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:47,106
What's your relationship with Eun Sook?

762
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:48,905
- What do you mean?
- Look.

763
00:50:48,906 --> 00:50:51,246
How close must you two be...

764
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:55,346
for the cold-hearted woman
who ignored everyone else...

765
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:58,546
to change her mind and come
over in person to settle?

766
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:01,006
What are you implying?

767
00:51:01,206 --> 00:51:03,746
I heard you worked with her in this store.

768
00:51:03,946 --> 00:51:06,506
Did you two have something
more than just a friendship?

769
00:51:06,706 --> 00:51:08,946
You really drive me crazy.

770
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:10,976
You are terminal.

771
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:13,546
I say this all the time,
but you're delusional.

772
00:51:13,646 --> 00:51:16,446
Your delusional jealousy requires
hospitalisation and long-term care.

773
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:18,446
Did you really not do anything?

774
00:51:18,546 --> 00:51:21,246
We didn't, I swear. Am I crazy?

775
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:25,576
But then, she isn't your type, is she?

776
00:51:26,006 --> 00:51:27,105
What is my type?

777
00:51:27,106 --> 00:51:28,546
Women like me...

778
00:51:28,746 --> 00:51:30,946
with a body that curves in
and out in the right places.

779
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:34,246
You like sexy and wholesome women.

780
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:37,546
You have such high standards.

781
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:40,876
I really can't take this any more.

782
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:44,076
Come home early. I'll be
waiting with the eel.

783
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,476
Stop talking about the eel.

784
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:48,046
Don't wink.

785
00:51:49,646 --> 00:51:52,346
It's not just any agency.
It's Hyesung Entertainment.

786
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:55,046
Mr Kang, you know them.

787
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:58,846
It's one of the top three
agencies in Korea.

788
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:03,176
They want to release me album.
This is a winning lottery ticket.

789
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:08,406
Can't you really lend me anything?

790
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:11,306
Okay.

791
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:16,176
I get it. You can't lend
me what you don't have.

792
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:18,276
Bye.

793
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:20,376
Let's talk soon.

794
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,106
- Did he say no?
- Yes.

795
00:52:28,046 --> 00:52:29,776
He's not doing too well.

796
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:32,206
I feel so bad for you.

797
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:35,376
You said you'll never get
another chance like this.

798
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:37,406
If I try hard enough,

799
00:52:38,546 --> 00:52:40,306
I'll get another shot.

800
00:52:46,676 --> 00:52:49,746
Susanna

801
00:52:50,176 --> 00:52:53,476
I will be

802
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:56,006
By your side

803
00:52:56,206 --> 00:53:01,206
I won't let go of your hands

804
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:36,306
Don't cry.

805
00:53:36,676 --> 00:53:39,806
I cry if you cry.

806
00:53:40,746 --> 00:53:43,406
I didn't think it would be
this hard to make a comeback.

807
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:47,306
Had I known it would be this tough,

808
00:53:48,746 --> 00:53:50,676
I wouldn't have come back.

809
00:53:54,006 --> 00:53:56,146
My poor Jun...

810
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:38,476
Who are you?

811
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:43,346
Did we just talk on the phone?

812
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:47,846
Yes. I'm Min Hyo Won.

813
00:54:49,006 --> 00:54:50,046
Have a seat.

814
00:54:57,246 --> 00:54:59,476
Don't you remember me?

815
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:03,776
Have we met before?

816
00:55:07,306 --> 00:55:08,576
Do you really...

817
00:55:10,146 --> 00:55:11,346
not remember me?

818
00:55:24,306 --> 00:55:25,546
I don't.

819
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:28,506
How can you not remember me?

820
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:31,706
We met outside of Meesa Apparel's restroom.

821
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:32,945
Meesa Apparel's restroom?

822
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,976
When you threw up the day of the interview.

823
00:55:36,406 --> 00:55:38,076
I was right there.

824
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:53,306
I don't know.

825
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:56,946
I remember the situation,
but not your face. Sorry.

826
00:55:59,006 --> 00:56:02,076
I called you a few times after that.

827
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:04,076
Don't you remember?

828
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:06,206
- Is this Kang Tae Yang?
- That's me.

829
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:09,552
Why do you care if I get drunk or not?

830
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,346
You really need help!

831
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:14,676
You can't waste your life away!

832
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:16,706
You can't be so negative.

833
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,076
What do you mean?

834
00:56:18,176 --> 00:56:19,546
Here's your soju.

835
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:21,446
Are you drinking again?

836
00:56:21,676 --> 00:56:24,906
What's wrong with you?
Don't live like that!

837
00:56:25,176 --> 00:56:27,546
Don't waste your one-and-only life!

838
00:56:29,576 --> 00:56:30,646
Sorry.

839
00:56:30,906 --> 00:56:32,882
Are you pretending because
you feel embarrassed?

840
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:34,806
No. I really don't remember you.

841
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:41,206
How did you recognise me at the hospital?

842
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:44,306
How did you end up signing the consent...

843
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:48,006
- You jerk!
- What?

844
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,446
You gorilla, chimpanzee,
man-eating shark, sloth!

845
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:52,145
- Hey.
- You cheat...

846
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:53,506
on multiple women,

847
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:55,506
so how can you not remember me?

848
00:56:56,106 --> 00:56:57,946
Just a moment, Moon Hyo Won.

849
00:56:58,176 --> 00:56:59,976
It's Min Hyo Won, not Moon Hyo Won!

850
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:03,976
I shouldn't have signed the form.

851
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:07,046
I should've left you with
whatever broken limb it was.

852
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:13,206
What's wrong with her? What did I do wrong?

853
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:21,946
Hey.

854
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:28,776
Hey.

855
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:34,476
What got into her?

856
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:37,706
Thanks anyway!

857
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:47,776
Yun Shil.

858
00:57:48,706 --> 00:57:51,106
- Did they release you already?
- Yes, just now.

859
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,675
Should you be out so soon?

860
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:54,806
I have a follow-up appointment every week.

861
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:58,106
You look upset. Is something wrong?

862
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:01,006
I just went to a job interview.

863
00:58:01,406 --> 00:58:02,406
I failed.

864
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:05,646
Anyone would welcome someone
with your skill-set.

865
00:58:06,006 --> 00:58:08,006
The store doesn't make their own suits.

866
00:58:08,106 --> 00:58:11,706
They take measurements and decide
on a design for the factory.

867
00:58:11,976 --> 00:58:12,976
Do they do that?

868
00:58:12,977 --> 00:58:16,846
Most places do, apparently.
Handmade suits don't turn a profit.

869
00:58:18,976 --> 00:58:22,106
If my mother-in-law finds
out I lost my job,

870
00:58:22,406 --> 00:58:25,776
she'll scream at me to move
in with her right away.

871
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:29,246
You can't do that. Don't give in.

872
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:30,906
I won't.

873
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,246
- Let's cross.
- Okay.

874
00:58:38,106 --> 00:58:39,646
You're too sure of yourself.

875
00:58:39,846 --> 00:58:42,306
(Seoul District Court)

876
00:58:42,406 --> 00:58:44,946
Being a hypocrite and pretending
you don't care about money...

877
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:46,576
will bite you in the backside.

878
00:58:46,846 --> 00:58:48,706
I wasn't there for you until the end.

879
00:58:49,576 --> 00:58:50,776
I'm sorry.

880
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:53,506
I should also apologise to your father.

881
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:55,576
I don't need your money.

882
00:58:55,976 --> 00:58:57,676
You show off to the end.

883
00:58:59,576 --> 00:59:02,676
I can't say we were happy together,

884
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:05,876
but I'm grateful.

885
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:10,706
I hope you can be free and happy.

886
00:59:13,706 --> 00:59:14,846
You know,

887
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:18,276
I used to feel bad that I didn't love you.

888
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:21,246
Now I think it was all for the best.

889
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,576
You didn't deserve my love.

890
00:59:25,206 --> 00:59:27,405
You're a weak and foolish loser who...

891
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:28,746
It's over now.

892
00:59:29,306 --> 00:59:30,306
Let's stop.

893
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:33,046
That's the least we can do for each other.

894
00:59:33,406 --> 00:59:35,906
How can you say that after
you ruined my life?

895
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,306
I decided not to wonder where...

896
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,006
it all went wrong.

897
00:59:40,776 --> 00:59:44,406
I won't look back at the past. I'll
look forward towards happiness.

898
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:47,146
I think you should, too.

899
00:59:48,476 --> 00:59:50,276
What? Happiness?

900
00:59:50,876 --> 00:59:52,976
You crushed my self-esteem.

901
00:59:53,746 --> 00:59:57,646
People now point and laugh at me.

902
00:59:58,046 --> 00:59:59,676
Don't talk about happiness.

903
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:01,246
You really care about...

904
01:00:01,876 --> 01:00:03,146
nothing but yourself.

905
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:07,346
I should go. Drive safely.

906
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:12,946
Lee Dong Jin!

907
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:31,806
Please leave a message.

908
01:00:32,746 --> 01:00:33,846
It's me, Dad.

909
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:36,806
I quit Meesa a while ago.

910
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:39,546
And now, I work at your store.

911
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:41,106
Also,

912
01:00:43,146 --> 01:00:45,506
I just divorced my wife, too.

913
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:50,976
Am I...

914
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:54,046
a failure?

915
01:00:56,306 --> 01:00:58,046
I worked harder than most...

916
01:00:58,576 --> 01:01:00,446
and never stopped for a break.

917
01:01:03,946 --> 01:01:05,576
Is what I'm facing now...

918
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:09,546
what failure looks like?

919
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:11,976
Dong Jin.

920
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:13,746
Life, you know,

921
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:16,146
isn't about changing faces.

922
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:18,946
It's about changing your facial expression.

923
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,506
You just passed a certain
point in your life.

924
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:27,276
If you give in now, you will fail.

925
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:31,406
If you get up and keep going,
it will become an experience.

926
01:01:32,246 --> 01:01:33,676
There is one thing...

927
01:01:34,006 --> 01:01:36,476
you must remember.

928
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:39,576
No one can help you get up.

929
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,576
Your mum and I will watch and
cheer you on with all our hearts,

930
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:46,846
but you must get up yourself.

931
01:01:47,776 --> 01:01:50,046
I want you to get back on your feet,

932
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,076
return to your loved ones,

933
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:55,176
and stride proudly into the world again.

934
01:01:59,576 --> 01:02:02,446
I'll work at your store for a while.

935
01:02:02,906 --> 01:02:06,446
I'll take a good look at my
life and pull myself together.

936
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:08,906
Could you come back soon?

937
01:02:14,576 --> 01:02:16,776
I'm almost done here.

938
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:18,246
I'll be back soon.

939
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:21,246
Remember this.

940
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:23,806
Dong Jin.

941
01:02:25,006 --> 01:02:27,176
You have not failed.

942
01:02:39,376 --> 01:02:40,906
(Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)

943
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:58,406
Good morning.

944
01:02:58,576 --> 01:02:59,576
You're here early.

945
01:02:59,706 --> 01:03:00,852
Do you want coffee?

946
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,246
Yes, please.

947
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,476
Where's Yun Shil?

948
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:07,146
Isn't she here?

949
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:10,306
She found a job. Today's her first day.

950
01:03:10,406 --> 01:03:11,406
Really?

951
01:03:12,106 --> 01:03:15,006
She said she had an interview.
I guess she got the job.

952
01:03:15,106 --> 01:03:17,875
It's not at a tailor store.
It's at the supermarket.

953
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:19,006
What?

954
01:03:19,506 --> 01:03:21,176
Why would she work there?

955
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:25,376
People like us who barely make a
living can't afford to be picky.

956
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:27,746
We have to earn our keep.

957
01:03:27,946 --> 01:03:30,106
She needs to earn whatever she can.

958
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,506
She's only a part-timer.

959
01:03:37,306 --> 01:03:40,006
We have pork belly from Jeju Island.

960
01:03:40,146 --> 01:03:41,506
Come and try some.

961
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:45,776
It's nice and chewy.

962
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:48,346
Try some. You don't have to buy any.

963
01:03:48,706 --> 01:03:51,706
Hello, Ma'am. Why don't you try some?

964
01:03:53,306 --> 01:03:55,676
Doesn't it taste better
than the usual pork belly?

965
01:03:55,906 --> 01:03:57,906
I can't tell after just one piece.

966
01:04:04,576 --> 01:04:07,305
Slow down. You might get indigestion.

967
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:10,576
Are you criticising me for eating too much?

968
01:04:11,006 --> 01:04:13,446
No, I'm not criticising you.

969
01:04:13,846 --> 01:04:15,946
I'm just worried you'll get sick.

970
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:34,246
Hey!

971
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:38,046
How dare you get oil on this blouse!
Have you lost your mind?

972
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,206
I apologise. I'm really sorry.

973
01:04:40,406 --> 01:04:44,275
What will you do about this grease?
What will you do about this?

974
01:04:44,276 --> 01:04:48,205
Can you please calm down? I'll
pay for it to get cleaned.

975
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:51,576
Do you know how much this costs?
Dry-cleaning isn't the issue here!

976
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:54,276
Get on your knees and beg!

977
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:56,006
On my knees?

978
01:04:56,206 --> 01:04:59,406
What the customer says goes.
Get on your knees!

979
01:04:59,506 --> 01:05:00,906
This costs a fortune.

980
01:05:01,006 --> 01:05:03,706
That's a blouse from Agnes
Allen's 2014 FW collection.

981
01:05:04,576 --> 01:05:05,576
Right?

982
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:12,006
This should be enough to get you
another one at an outlet store.

983
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:13,876
You can relax.

984
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,446
Two drops of grease?

985
01:05:37,306 --> 01:05:38,946
Come back to the store.

986
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:42,506
- What?
- I'll let you work there.

987
01:05:44,776 --> 01:05:46,246
Don't you get it?

988
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:47,806
You can come back.

989
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:49,906
No thanks.

990
01:05:52,106 --> 01:05:53,146
What?

991
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:56,976
I'm not bored enough to come and go...

992
01:05:57,406 --> 01:05:59,206
whenever you give the order.

993
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,376
I won't come back.

(The Gentlemen of Wolgyesu Tailor Shop)

995
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:46,305
Why is she playing hard to get?

996
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:49,305
Should I have taken the
job when he offered it?

997
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:50,306
I trust you, okay?

998
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:53,205
Why do you still want a kid at our age?

999
01:06:53,206 --> 01:06:55,205
Your wife is very eager,

1000
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:57,975
so I can safely say you have a good chance.

1001
01:06:57,976 --> 01:06:59,675
Can you sleep elsewhere tonight?

1002
01:06:59,676 --> 01:07:02,745
Wait for me, everyone!
Sung Jun's coming back!

1003
01:07:02,746 --> 01:07:04,145
I have a bad feeling.

1004
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:06,205
Don't tell anyone that I quit the store.

1005
01:07:06,206 --> 01:07:08,245
Welcome to Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.

1006
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:09,845
I'm here to see my daughter-in-law.

1007

She's at the tailor shop?
