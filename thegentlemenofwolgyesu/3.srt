00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,400
(Episode 3)

4
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,900
Are you okay?

5
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,760
You're the CEO.

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,270
What? Is it you again?

7
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,170
You aren't ignoring me this time.

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,670
Do you remember me?

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,970
Is this a joke?

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,340
Why did you follow me here? Are you a stalker?

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,270
Me? A stalker? No way.

12
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,950
I'm not like that.

13
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,990
Why did you follow me, then?

14
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't follow you. I was just taking care of...

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,000
You're the one who showed up while I was taking care of business.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
An adult should know better than to urinate in public.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,270
Where are your manners?

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,040
It wasn't in public.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,640
My mother-in-law works at this vineyard.

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,570
What are you doing here anyway?

21
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,140
Are you a pervert?

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,140
A what?

23
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,630
I came here for a company dinner.

24
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,840
I came to eat some kind of fish...

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,000
Forget about it. What a rotten day.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,570
Grape stains never come out.

27
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,070
Gosh, where do you think you're touching?

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,800
By the way,

29
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,870
don't you know Hong Gi Pyo?

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,540
I said I don't.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,450
Why do you keep saying that?

32
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,350
You're the CEO of Meesa Apparel.

33
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,540
I'm not.

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,070
How many times must I tell you that I'm not?

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,670
Mr CEO.

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,510
Where are you?

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,570
- Mr CEO.
 -  Darn it.

38
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,840
Mr CEO.

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,930
Why are you hiding?

40
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,070
- What about you?
 -  Mr CEO.

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,870
Should I not?

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,440
- Mr CEO.
 -  Sit still.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,440
Mr CEO.

44
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,900
Mr CEO.

45
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,580
You are the CEO.

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,130
- Meesa Apparel CEO Min Hyo Sang.
 -  Mr CEO.

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,710
I'm not. That's not who I am.

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,470
Where in the world is he?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh, no.

50
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,300
Wait.

51
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,430
Don't just leave.

52
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,860
You might as well help me out.

53
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,730
I have a feeling you could get Gi Pyo out.

54
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,370
There's a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
I don't know that name.

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,070
- Will you let go of me?
 -  Oh, no.

57
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,670
Could you help me get up?

58
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,800
Gosh, grape stains are hard to get out.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,920
Wait. Sir.

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,300
Good riddance.

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,000
Sir. Come back!

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,140
Hey! Come back!

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,370
Something bad happens whenever I meet her.

64
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,470
Gosh, what a mess.

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,670
This shirt's ruined.

66
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,080
Look at this mess.

67
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,670
My goodness gracious.

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,710
What happened?

69
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,890
You crushed some perfectly fine grapes.

70
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,440
What should I do with these? It's such a waste.

71
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,840
Are you here to help me or ruin me?

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,740
Why are you always causing trouble?

73
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,930
I'm really sorry.

74
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,640
- Lead the way.
 -  What?

75
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,600
We can't let someone get away with ruining our grapes.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,340
We have to get compensated.

77
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,510
He didn't ruin them on purpose.

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,560
He just lost his balance and fell.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,360
What is wrong with you? What kind of attitude is that?

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,530
Your husband's in jail, and he needs our support.

81
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,870
We have to salvage and sell whatever we can.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,390
I would love to know what you're thinking.

83
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,900
I wasn't like you the last time Gi Pyo was in jail.

84
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,370
Was he in jail before?

85
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,400
Is this not his first time?

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Stop talking nonsense.

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,870
Just lead the way.

88
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,070
Come along.

89
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,340
- I couldn't find him.
 -  Did he get lost?

90
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Sir.

91
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,570
- My goodness.
 -  Sir.

92
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,630
What happened to you?

93
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,820
I lost my balance and fell. I'm fine, though.

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,400
You don't look fine.

95
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,100
- Miss Kim, your handkerchief.
 -  My handkerchief.

96
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,300
Really, it's fine.

97
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,890
You need to wipe that off.

98
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,940
You look like a drenched mouse.

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,070
You there.

100
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,600
Is that him?

101
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,660
You can't just disappear after crushing...

102
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,340
someone's prized grapes.

103
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,370
You look like a gentleman.

104
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,330
I was going to report you for destroying my crops,

105
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,150
but then I got curious.

106
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,670
I wanted to see the face of the shameless fool...

107
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,100
who had the guts to run off after doing this.

108
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,140
- That's why I'm here.
 -  Mother.

109
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,310
You're such a softie. Be quiet.

110
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,060
Look here, lady.

111
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,590
Don't talk to him like that.

112
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,720
Do you even know who this gentleman is?

113
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,060
- Who is he?
 -  Let me introduce him.

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,370
This is Meesa Logistics' CEO, Lee Dong Jin.

115
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,650
Aren't you Min Hyo Sang?

116
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,720
Mr Min's the CEO at our head office in Seoul.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,640
Mr Lee here is the CEO of Meesa Logistics.

118
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
That means you must have a lot of money.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,460
That's 10 boxes at 20 dollars per box.

120
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,040
So you owe me 200 dollars.

121
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,670
How is this worth...

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,800
Okay. Fine.

123
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,270
We don't take credit cards. It's cash only.

124
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,140
Sorry.

125
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,810
If you're short on cash, I can lend you some.

126
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,370
- 30 dollars, please.
 -  Sure.

127
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,740
Here you go.

128
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,070
Sorry. It wasn't my idea. I'm really sorry.

129
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,470
I'm so sorry. I really am.

130
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,820
- He isn't in.
 -  Oh, dear.

131
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,430
Do you think he's ill?

132
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,990
I hope not.

133
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,540
His wife is here.

134
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,860
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

135
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,640
Is your husband sick?

136
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,860
He isn't.

137
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,370
Why hasn't he come to work then?

138
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,740
I haven't seen him in days.

139
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,500
He had some family business to take care of.

140
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,260
He went to his hometown.

141
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,420
My goodness, I had no idea.

142
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,660
I thought he had fallen ill.

143
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,500
I was so worried.

144
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,040
Do you know when he will be back?

145
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,570
I don't know.

146
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,440
It'll take him some time to sort everything out.

147
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,540
Just a moment.

148
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,800
I brought these for your husband.

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,280
I didn't pick them up from the street.

150
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,000
They're from my back garden.

151
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,200
They're clean and fresh. Cook your husband something.

152
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,100
How do you know that...

153
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,930
he likes courgettes?

154
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,270
You might not know, but your husband...

155
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,650
is like family to us now.

156
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,820
He cares for my daughter like she's his own granddaughter.

157
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,640
He's like a dad to me.

158
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,970
(Closed for a while)

159
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,170
Your food is here.

160
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,670
My gosh. You didn't have to come all the way here.

161
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,410
I could come home for lunch.

162
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,550
You missed lunch because you had to go out on business.

163
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,870
I made kalguksu...

164
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,800
with fresh clams and courgettes, your favourite.

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,170
Eat up before it gets cold.

166
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,990
It smells delicious.

167
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,670
Try the soup first.

168
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,000
I worked so hard all day that I can't even hold a spoon.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,770
Could you feed me?

170
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,670
You become more like a child as you get older.

171
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,060
What if people see?

172
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,810
It's just us. Who is there to look? Come on. Feed me your kalguksu.

173
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,900
My goodness.

174
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,070
Open wide.

175
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,370
That's good.

176
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,200
It tastes better because you're feeding me.

177
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,930
Your comments are getting cornier, too.

178
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm getting goosebumps.

179
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,130
Do you like me that much?

180
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,730
Will you stop it?

181
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,840
You can't stop liking me, can you?

182
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,530
Stop being silly and eat up. My goodness.

183
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,670
Here you go.

184
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,940
That is so good.

185
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,140
I hope he's eating well.

186
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,970
Stop making me worry and come back home.

187
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,570
I'll chop up some courgettes...

188
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,440
and make you kalguksu.

189
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,340
Hey.

190
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,440
Excuse me.

191
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,100
What's he thinking about?

192
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,300
Sir, wake up. The chicken's burnt.

193
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,570
Oh, dear. Was it in for that long?

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,440
It turned black in a blink of an eye.

195
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,110
You're so witty.

196
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:39,480
If you could spare me a few minutes, I'll fry up a fresh young chicken.

197
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,800
Sure, go ahead.

198
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,370
You must work out in your free time.

199
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,440
Look at your muscles.

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,470
I do, a bit.

201
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,840
You have a lovely set of biceps and triceps.

202
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,840
They're like a horse's thighs.

203
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,570
You must work out yourself if you can tell them apart.

204
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,640
I've been going to the gym for over 10 years.

205
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,740
Oh, I see. That must be it.

206
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,730
I could tell you know a few things about muscles.

207
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,140
If only my husband had muscles like yours.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,040
Would you mind if I touched them?

209
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
What?

210
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,240
That's a bit...

211
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,300
Just a slight touch.

212
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,540
Let me compare it with my husband's.

213
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,770
Quickly, then.

214
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,230
This here is the bicep.

215
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,760
This is the real deal.

216
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,340
And to the back here is the triceps.

217
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,430
They say it looks like the horse's thigh.

218
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,740
My finger won't even go in. You're so...

219
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Who are you?

220
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,630
- What are you doing to my husband?
 -  Honey.

221
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,360
You can't assault our customers. She'll lose her hair.

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,540
Ouch, ouch.

223
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,600
Take your chicken and leave.

224
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,540
Don't ruin the market's friendly atmosphere...

225
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,740
by groping my husband's arm.

226
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,530
Let go! I didn't grope anything!

227
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,100
I just wanted to compare it to my husband's arm!

228
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,370
She didn't grope me. I taught her about muscles.

229
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,870
Don't you lie to me.

230
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,270
Let go before I call my husband!

231
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,770
Okay. Get your husband over here.

232
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,040
I will grope his muscles instead...

233
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,400
and maybe even crush them if I can.

234
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
That really hurts!

235
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,650
(Traditional patbingsu)

236
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,200
She's so violent and ignorant.

237
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,470
She's always getting into fights.

238
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,500
Everyone saw her.

239
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,670
What an embarrassment.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
I can't stand it.

241
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,300
I've had enough.

242
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,300
That's so cold.

243
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Oh, dear.

244
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,540
(Mr Lee)

245
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,310
The phone has been turned off. Please leave a message.

246
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,770
To record, press one.

247
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,970
Why won't you pick up? Where are you? What are you up to?

248
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,770
Can you at least leave a message to say you're okay?

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,240
If you're angry or upset, go home and talk it over.

250
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,040
I'll wait for your call.

251
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,340
You're possessed by a fighter's ghost.

252
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,240
What woman doesn't care about shame or reputation?

253
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,300
You assault someone at least twice a week.

254
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,470
I told you to sell chicken, not flirt with customers.

255
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,870
Why did you start all this by showing her your muscles?

256
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,770
Get help before it's too late.

257
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,170
Why? Am I bleeding?

258
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,780
I don't think so.

259
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,530
Go to a mental hospital. Your jealousy is just too much.

260
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,200
- What?
 -  See?

261
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,190
This is why two people who are similar should get married.

262
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,190
You married me out of greed.

263
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,130
That's why you're always anxious.

264
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,540
You're chronically and habitually delusional.

265
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,840
I'm married to a man who looks so perfect.

266
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,300
I must've done something heroic in my previous lifetime.

267
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,870
Sun Nyeo, could you grant your great husband one wish?

268
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,870
You know that I'm...

269
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,840
I'm very sensitive and artistic.

270
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,980
Do I really have to spend my life...

271
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,110
chopping up and frying pieces of chicken in a market?

272
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,740
Not again.

273
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,570
Don't even talk about suits.

274
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,900
Mr Lee left home. He disappeared.

275
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,090
- Why is that your business?
 -  Why do you think he left?

276
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,560
He inherited the store, and he has no one to leave it to.

277
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,340
He can't bear the thought of closing it himself.

278
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,670
Mr Lee practically saved my life. He's like a father to me.

279
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,540
He put me through high school and got me a job.

280
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,940
He did what my biological father didn't.

281
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,890
Could you please let me take over his store?

282
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,300
This is your final warning.

283
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,840
If you go back to making suits,

284
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,340
it really is over between us.

285
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,140
I'll divorce you.

286
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,470
Divorce?

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,610
Should I just go for it?

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,670
We called it in three days ago. Why hasn't anything happened?

289
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,780
We're doing our best. Give us a bit more time.

290
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,730
The FBI and CSI people...

291
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,020
find criminals just like that with very little evidence.

292
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Why are you so slow?

293
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,850
We're... What's the word?

294
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,370
We preserved the scene and there are clues everywhere.

295
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,300
What's the problem?

296
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,670
You watched a little too much TV.

297
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,470
What?

298
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,500
All I do is look at you.

299
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,670
(Miseong Supermarket)

300
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,000
All I do is wait for the right time

301
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,670
I'm always whispering sweet nothings.

302
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,170
And yet I can't.

303
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,540
Say that I love you.

304
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,720
- I just stand in the alley
 -  My goodness.

305
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,610
- Who's that?
 -  As I miss you.

306
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,440
It's Sung Jun.

307
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,170
My heart just aches.

308
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,300
For your love.

309
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,640
What should I do?

310
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,770
We're running in circles.

311
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,630
Time is passing us by.

312
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,800
First, he sang at a wedding.

313
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,110
Now, he's promoting a supermarket.

314
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,400
How did he end up like this?

315
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,640
Oh, dear. It's raining.

316
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,610
My heart just aches.

317
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,800
For your love.

318
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,870
What should I do? It's raining.

319
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,540
What should I do?

320
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,640
My goodness.

321
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,370
I was a fan since I was a teenager.

322
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,570
"Susanna's Handkerchief" is still my favourite song.

323
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,760
I can't believe I'm sharing an umbrella with a fan.

324
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,400
It's like a scene from a romance novel.

325
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,470
When do you get off work?

326
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,930
I think I can wrap things up soon.

327
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,390
Why don't you come back to my store to dry up...

328
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,020
and have some tea?

329
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,770
That's so nice of you. Is your business nearby?

330
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,170
Yes.

331
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,540
What do you do?

332
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,670
You could say that I'm into contents distribution.

333
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,070
Contents distribution?

334
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,470
Contents distribution was an exaggeration.

335
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,800
All she does is rent comic books.

336
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,400
Sung Jun.

337
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,730
I made you ramyeon that's so good, you won't notice a murder happen.

338
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,840
My goodness. It'd be wrong of me to eat this here.

339
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm not that rude. Don't mind me.

340
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,540
I haven't seen you in so long.

341
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,020
I don't mind serving you instant noodles.

342
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,040
I think...

343
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,280
you are slightly older than I am.

344
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,050
You keep talking to me like I'm older.

345
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,740
I don't know how to react.

346
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,140
Is there something wrong with my makeup?

347
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm not that old.

348
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,170
I'm a year younger than you.

349
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,040
How rude of me.

350
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,630
My apologies.

351
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,840
It's fine. It happens.

352
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,870
Don't feel pressured...

353
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,370
and help yourself.

354
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay.

355
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,500
I don't want to be rude, so I'll just have a taste.

356
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,970
Maybe it's because you're a singer, but you have strong lungs.

357
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,070
That was cooked perfectly.

358
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,370
Have some kimchi, too.

359
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,050
The kimchi turned red in anger...

360
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,670
because I was eating only the noodles.

361
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,340
You haven't lost your sense of humour, either.

362
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,410
"Red in anger". You're so funny.

363
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,900
So you like these types of jokes.

364
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,900
(Dong Sook's Comic Book Store)

365
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,470
What is this?

366
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,120
- Thank you for the noodles.
 -  No way.

367
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,040
I didn't cook you noodles to make money off of you.

368
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,240
I know.

369
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
I...

370
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,460
I know how you feel, Dong Sook.

371
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,500
But I hate taking things for free. It goes against my principles.

372
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,960
I was famous for refusing sponsors when I was active as a singer.

373
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
Yes, but...

374
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,170
still,

375
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,940
I can't take money from you.

376
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,630
Rather than money,

377
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,760
why don't you sign some autographs for our clients?

378
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,270
What autographs?

379
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,540
Shall I?

380
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,740
Thank you.

381
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,200
Everyone.

382
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,300
Attention please.

383
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,570
Today, the famous rock ballad singer,

384
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,240
Sung Jun, is here with us today.

385
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,360
He says he will give five lucky people an autograph...

386
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,380
on a first-come-first-served basis,

387
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,970
so please line up.

388
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,340
It's only the first five.

389
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,540
Mr Kim, don't you want an autograph?

390
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,570
I'm fine.

391
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,780
What about you, Mr Park?

392
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,040
These days, I guess everyone call themselves a singer.

393
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,810
Min Soo, isn't it your dream to become a singer?

394
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,740
You should get an autograph from an experienced singer.

395
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,020
How lame.

396
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,400
- You rude little...
 -  I have a gig, so I need to go.

397
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,570
- Thank you for the noodles.
 -  But...

398
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,570
Sung Jun. Sung Jun.

399
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,370
Sung Jun!

400
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,970
Sung Jun!

401
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,770
Sung Jun! Sung Jun!

402
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,380
What do I do? That must have hurt his ego.

403
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,370
Why were they being so difficult? Just take the free autograph.

404
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,670
Those punks are useless.

405
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,570
How humiliating.

406
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,670
What a disgrace.

407
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,200
I will never forget this insult.

408
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
They said we could turn our misfortunes into our advantage.

409
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,040
I'll call and then...

(Two Grand)

411
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,400
I'll put an end to this.

(Traditional Chicken for Sale)

413
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,530
What? What now?

414
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,400
What do you mean, "what now?" When will you pay for my guitar?

415
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,770
I have nothing to say,

416
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,550
- so talk to my wife. Wait.
 -  You coward.

417
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,340
I have nothing to say to your wife, so don't you dare put her on.

418
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,600
Yes, hello.

419
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,670
We were just about to forget, and you call again.

420
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,120
I fixed it perfectly with glue.

421
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,800
What did you call to complain about this time?

422
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,770
Look, mister!

423
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,870
Are you listening? Hey!

424
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,900
This is not my day.

425
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm so humiliated.

426
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,920
He didn't do it on purpose.

427
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,640
It was an accident.

428
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,020
You went too far, taking 200 dollars...

429
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,340
for the grapes.

430
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,730
It's not like we need to throw them out.

431
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,590
If we make grape juice like this, we don't take a loss at all.

432
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,280
You're such a softy.

433
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,970
How many times do I have to tell you?

434
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,440
We need to earn as much as possible...

435
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,300
to send your husband some money when he's in jail.

436
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,570
I'm telling you, it's not easy taking care of someone in jail.

437
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,940
Goodness.

438
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,760
Also, let me make this clear just in case.

439
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,670
You may not gone through with the wedding,

440
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,240
but you promised to wed and exchanged rings,

441
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,040
so you and Gi Pyo are a married couple, okay?

442
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
So don't get any funny ideas and wait like a good little girl,

443
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,440
and prepare yourself to be a good wife.

444
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,770
Why aren't you responding?

445
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,240
Yes, Mother.

446
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,650
I've never worked at a convenience store before.

447
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,090
It's your rare day off. Why didn't you rest at home?

448
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,330
I like helping you like this.

449
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,640
It's not helping at all, so please leave.

450
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,850
- Hello?
 -  Is this Kang Tae Yang?

451
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,440
Yes, it is. Who is this?

452
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,370
This is the HR office at Meesa Apparel.

453
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,500
You passed...

454
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,400
the written application stage for the open recruitment,

455
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,070
so I wanted to let you know.

456
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,340
Om September 5 at 1pm,

457
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,230
come to Meesa headquarters for your interview.

458
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,570
I really passed?

459
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,070
You didn't call the wrong number, did you?

460
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,340
- Is it really Kang Tae Yang?
 -  Yes, it is.

461
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,570
We will text you the details for the interview.

462
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,960
Tae Yang, you just got a job, didn't you?

463
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Which company is it? Where?

464
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,260
I passed the written application stage, that's all.

465
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,400
That's awesome!

466
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,970
I heard it's impossible to pass even the application stage.

467
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
You're awesome.

468
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,410
It's nothing. Stop freaking out.

469
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,970
It is not nothing.

470
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,740
You need to look good for the interview,

471
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,670
- so I'll cut your hair.
 -  No thanks.

472
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,840
Tae Yang, do you want to watch a movie with me?

473
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,320
I'll treat you to a movie and dinner since I got paid today.

474
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,070
I watch movies and eat only with my girlfriend.

475
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,670
Do you mean the announcer, Choi Ji Yun?

476
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,020
You know well.

477
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,440
She's a regular at our salon,

478
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,720
and she's so arrogant and stubborn.

479
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,650
She complains about the shampoo scent, the water temperature...

480
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,550
and all sorts of ridiculous things that drives the staff crazy.

481
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,670
Da Jeong. Watch what you say. You don't even know her.

482
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,850
Women know women the best.

483
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,300
Don't come by if you're going to say things like that.

484
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,670
You'll regret it when she betrays you and breaks your heart!

485
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,040
He's so stupid.

486
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,900
He has no taste in girls.

487
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,530
- Let's eat.
 -  Okay.

488
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,840
- Here. Cheers.
 -  Cheers.

489
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,200
- Cheers.
 -  Cheers.

490
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,670
- Thank you.
 -  Hi, Dong Sook.

491
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,770
Has Dad called yet?

492
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,070
Did you go to the police?

493
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,820
No. I'm out of town, so I can't today.

494
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,970
I'll go tomorrow.

495
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,670
How's Mother doing?

496
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,600
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

497
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,110
Anyway, my uncle is the mayor of this town,

498
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,730
so he went...

499
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,360
to the grape orchard owner's son's wedding,

500
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,950
and he said the police came barging in during the ceremony...

501
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,490
and that it was a huge mess.

502
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,530
- That means they never got married.
 -  That's right.

503
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,840
I heard the groom used to be part of a gang.

504
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,090
Did he start a gang fight or something?

505
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:04,040
No. That son had the galls to take Meesa suits...

506
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,370
and change the labels and sell them.

507
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,900
- That jerk.
 -  What? Really?

508
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,270
What do you mean? What are you talking about?

509
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,540
Look here!

510
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
Hey, lady.

511
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,640
Where's your husband?

512
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,810
- Why do you ask?
 -  Your husband...

513
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,170
changed the labels on Meesa suits and sold them in the market,

514
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,840
and that's why he's in jail, right?

515
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,780
I don't know any of that.

516
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,870
Of course, you do.

517
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,710
- Were you in on it?
 -  What?

518
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,040
Did you and your husband work together to commit the crime?

519
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,170
What are you talking about?

520
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,200
If not, why did you come into my office...

521
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,630
and ask for Min Hyo Sang?

522
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,270
What about you? Why were you in someone else's office?

523
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,130
Don't change the subject and answer my question.

524
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,970
Why must I do that?

525
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,040
And why are you being rude to me?

526
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm busy, so move.

527
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,340
What are you doing?

528
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,440
Hi, Mr Kang. It's me.

529
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,340
Our company filed a suit recently against someone taking our suits...

530
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,640
and selling them under a different label. Find out its status for me.

531
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,770
- Great work today.
 -  Thanks.

532
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,780
- You too.
 -  Let's go eat.

533
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,980
What should we get?

534
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,280
Are you just getting off work?

535
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,360
Who is he? Is he your boyfriend?

536
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,910
Really? You had a boyfriend?

537
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,870
He isn't my boyfriend. He's just a friend from college.

538
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,540
What brings you here?

539
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,270
I wanted to grab dinner with you.

540
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,200
You should've called first. What if we missed each other?

541
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,850
I'm going to go first. I'll see you tomorrow.

542
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,190
- Good night.
 -  I'll see you another time.

543
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,470
- Okay.
 -  Sure.

544
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,150
Why do you keep showing up without calling?

545
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,260
I kept calling, but you didn't pick up.

546
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,600
Do you think I'm still a trainee? I'm an announcer now.

547
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,620
I sometimes don't even have time to eat with broadcasts and meetings.

548
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,930
Must you run right over to complain just because I don't pick up?

549
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,600
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced,

550
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,300
but I'm not here to fight, so let's stop.

551
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,200
Is that a new watch?

552
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,870
It's a fake.

553
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,340
I saw it in Dongdaemun when I went for a shoot.

554
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,170
It's cheap.

555
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,100
It's late, but happy birthday.

556
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,670
What is it?

557
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,070
It took me a while to pick it. I hope you like it.

558
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,270
I'm sorry, but I can't accept that.

559
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,940
- What do you mean?
 -  A ring...

560
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,360
is too burdensome. Sorry.

561
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,940
Are you saying I am burdensome to you now?

562
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,290
No, that's not it.

563
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,900
If not, just take it. I won't force you to wear it.

564
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,100
I said no.

565
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,660
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

566
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,910
My watch.

567
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,130
I scratched it. Oh, no.

568
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,760
I'll buy you a new one.

569
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,140
Do you know how much this costs? Someone like you can't afford it.

570
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Someone like me?

571
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,200
You said it's cheap.

572
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,370
You said you bought it from Dongdaemun.

573
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,170
I didn't tell you the truth to spare your pride,

574
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,540
but you can't afford this even if you save up for 10 years.

575
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,900
You can never buy me a new one.

576
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,070
Does that ring cost even 100 dollars?

577
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,670
You got a cash advance in order to buy that, didn't you?

578
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm going to get a job soon.

579
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,430
I got a call saying that I passed the written application stage.

580
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,600
Is there any guarantee...

581
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,970
that you'll pass the interview?

582
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,400
Ji Yun.

583
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,670
Once you pay off your school loans, send your mother money...

584
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,830
and pay your rent, how much would you have left?

585
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,290
What's wrong with you?

586
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,990
When I look at you, I'm reminded of when I ate...

587
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,390
at the convenience store to save just a few cents.

588
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,470
It's so pathetic that it's suffocating.

589
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,670
So leave me alone.

590
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,440
Please, I beg you.

591
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,400
(Yun Shil)

592
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,840
Are you in Seoul?

593
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,570
No, I'm still in Anseong.

594
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,370
There's so much to do, so I am helping Mother. I'll go tomorrow.

595
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,940
Did you give Ji Yun her gift?

596
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,010
- Not yet.
 -  Why not?

597
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,230
You haven't seen her yet?

598
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,200
What? Well...

599
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,230
She must be busy. I'll give it to her another time.

600
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,510
Why do you sound so down?

601
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,970
Is something wrong?

602
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,770
I just feel deflated.

603
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,640
Yun Shil.

604
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,540
I hear there's a watch that I can't buy even if I save up for 10 years.

605
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,200
That's so unfair.

606
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,640
If I can't buy a stupid watch...

607
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,070
after saving for 10 years,

608
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,440
something is wrong with this world, don't you think?

609
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,170
What are you talking about?

610
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,600
Yun Shil! Where are you?

611
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,940
My mother-in-law is looking for me. I'll call you later.

612
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,670
I'm coming!

613
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,260
I hear this part-time job pays well.

614
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,060
The medical testing?

615
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,460
I made 700 dollars after four days last month.

616
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,340
- 700 dollars?
 -  Give them a call.

617
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,640
I need to do this.

618
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,200
700 dollars? Wow.

619
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,870
A new drug test?

620
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,600
The world has changed.

621
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,950
People don't like your style of music any more.

622
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,360
Find another path.

623
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,370
I...

624
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,510
am Sung Jun.

625
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,840
I won Best New Artist in the music awards in the year 2000.

626
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,540
I'm Sung Jun!

627
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,840
I will show them.

628
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,220
I'll make my come-back as a singer...

629
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,740
and silence those jerks who disrespected me.

630
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300
You guys...

631
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,340
are all dead.

632
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,300
Just wait.

633
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,670
Ma'am, may I have more soup?

634
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,590
- Don't you want an autograph?
 -  I'm fine.

635
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,170
These days, I guess everyone call themselves a singer.

636
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,290
How lame.

637
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,640
Sung Jun! Sung Jun!

638
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,900
Poor Sung Jun.

639
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,640
Go to sleep already.

640
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,080
I have to leave early for work tomorrow.

641
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,300
Okay.

642
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,900
So find a good shaman.

643
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,740
If I can find out where he is,

644
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,800
I will pray, make sacrifices and do whatever it takes.

645
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,400
Who is that?

646
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,440
Okay. Call me.

647
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Who is it?

648
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,200
I called my sister to find me a good shaman.

649
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,650
Come on, now.

650
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,550
How could you believe in superstitions like that?

651
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,090
You annoying brat.

652
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,390
Why are you hitting me?

653
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,870
Who cares if it's just a superstition?

654
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,140
We need to do everything possible...

655
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,890
to find your father.

656
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,580
I went to the police...

657
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,870
and called everywhere he could've gone.

658
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,980
I've done my best, too.

659
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,410
Did he get possessed or something? What happened?

660
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,200
How could he disappear overnight?

661
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
What is going on?

662
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,040
That's it.

663
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,740
- What?
 -  We made a mistake...

664
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,580
on the tombstone for Uncle who passed away this spring.

665
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,670
What?

666
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,340
We made a mistake on the tombstone, so the ghosts must be angry.

667
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,070
Why else would your father leave home? Why?

668
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,170
Hold on.

669
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,870
Wait. Hold on.

670
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,800
What are you doing?

671
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,540
I can't just sit here.

672
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,270
I'll go to Uncle's wife...

673
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,300
and tell her to fix the tombstone.

674
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,710
Come on.

675
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,900
Do you realise what time it is?

676
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,230
Get your head on straight.

677
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,600
Who cares about the time?

678
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,600
We don't know where your father is or what he's doing.

679
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,970
It's past 10pm.

680
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,400
Sleep for now, and I'll go with you tomorrow. Okay?

681
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,100
What am I supposed to do?

682
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,870
What are you doing?

683
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,970
You should be happy I'm sleeping in the same room.

684
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,440
Are you still angry?

685
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,800
I said I was sorry.

686
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,670
You humiliated me in front of everyone. An apology doesn't cut it.

687
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,770
I didn't humiliate you. You can argue at times...

688
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,340
You're supposed to argue with your mouth.

689
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,070
But you used your hands and fists.

690
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,870
You're lucky she didn't file charges against you.

691
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,250
Do you think I'd just take it if she did?

692
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,830
She was groping my husband's arms.

693
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,470
- She deserved it.
 -  Why do I bother?

694
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,070
- My goodness.
 -  My gosh.

695
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,340
My life stinks.

696
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,300
Are you really going to sleep separately?

697
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,200
Don't touch me.

698
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,200
Come on, now.

699
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,670
I'm not in the mood.

700
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,240
You're never in the mood.

701
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,470
Come on, Sam Do.

702
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,800
Get off of me! What's wrong with you?

703
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,440
I have no idea where Mr Lee is or what he's doing.

704
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,570
How dare you try to seduce me? You're despicable.

705
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,780
To be blunt,

706
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,620
are you his son or something?

707
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,240
His children aren't doing anything.

708
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,140
Why are you so upset?

709
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,170
I told you. He is just like a father to me.

710
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,200
So please,

711
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,800
can't I run the tailor shop at least until he returns?

712
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,070
The store's about to close. Please.

713
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,270
I warned you...

714
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,180
never to mention the tailor shop again!

715
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,040
- My goodness.
 -  Sun Nyeo.

716
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,660
Sun Nyeo. Sun Nyeo. I'll be good.

717
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,400
Stop it!

718
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,200
My gosh.

719
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,940
What should I do about the tailor shop?

720
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,440
My gosh. It reeks of alcohol.

721
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,270
You drank until you were plastered, and you're drinking more?

722
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,170
Can't you live without alcohol?

723
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,070
Maybe you should get tested for alcoholism.

724
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,940
What if I'm alcoholic?

725
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,070
Was stealing Dad's fortune not enough?

726
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,670
- You plan to pocket mine, as well?
 -  What?

727
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,100
Why do I bother talking with a drunkard? I should stop.

728
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,570
Did you visit your in-laws?

729
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,770
I heard your father-in-law ran away from home.

730
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,800
You're the only daughter-in-law. You should do your duty.

731
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,200
My duty?

732
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,800
It's so awkward hearing you say that.

733
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,340
You should think about your husband.

734
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,040
He must feel bad toward his mum and sister about living here anyway.

735
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,900
If the only daughter-in-law doesn't care about his family,

736
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,870
how would he look?

737
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,850
Shouldn't you...

738
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,000
be the one to go visit my in-laws?

739
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,050
I heard you used to work...

740
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,380
at my father-in-law's shop before you got married.

741
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,270
You brought the clients tea and did the laundry.

742
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,500
But then again, I did hear you were quick-thinking even then.

743
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,540
According to my mother-in-law.

744
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,450
And? Did your mother-in-law say anything else?

745
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,670
Why? Do you share a secret with my in-laws or something?

746
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,270
What secret?

747
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,140
You look scared.

748
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,060
Did you steal money or something?

749
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,940
You should know how to hold your liquor. You're a mess.

750
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,570
That viper.

751
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,540
- Is she drinking again?
 -  Yes.

752
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,140
She's completed plastered.

753
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,130
Why did her father-in-law leave home?

754
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,030
That's the thing. They don't know.

755
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,890
How could they not know? Are you saying he left for no reason?

756
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,340
I don't know. Da Jeong doesn't seem to want to talk about it, either.

757
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,400
What gotten into him? He's not like this.

758
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,540
Dong Jin.

759
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,600
Why do you look like that?

760
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,780
Dong Jin. Are you doing physical labour at the factory?

761
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,470
No, I'm not.

762
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,400
Where's Hyo Joo?

763
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,870
She's in the kitchen.

764
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,510
How long are you going to lock him up in the factory?

765
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,460
When will you call him up to headquarters?

766
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,340
He barely just left. We can't call him back up already.

767
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,410
You're terrible.

768
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,640
I won't be your daughter any more. Remove me from the family registry.

769
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,250
I wondered why you weren't bringing that up.

770
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,030
You evil stepmother!

771
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,140
You fool.

772
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,170
If I'm the evil stepmother, you're the evil stepsister.

773
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,970
Really?

774
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,370
Why are you hitting me? You're so annoying.

775
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,140
Did you call my mother?

776
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,230
I said to at least call her if you weren't going to visit.

777
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,040
Do you expect me to be a good daughter-in-law in this situation?

778
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,540
And what situation is that?

779
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,270
Like you don't know?

780
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,300
Everything will be back to normal, so get your act together.

781
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,740
What do you mean?

782
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,970
Do you mean...

783
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,370
- you can become CEO again?
 -  Of course.

784
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,630
Do you mean it? You're not just saying it, are you?

785
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,800
Do I look that reckless to you?

786
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,770
- No.
 -  So please...

787
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,740
stop drinking.

788
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,040
What is it?

789
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,130
How did things change that you're so confident?

790
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,040
Hyo Sang and Mother will have to give in.

791
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,900
- Really? Do you mean it?
 -  Yes.

792
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,570
Thank you. Thank you, Honey.

793
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,970
What are you doing, Mum?

794
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,100
- I think Dong Jin caught on.
 -  Caught onto what?

795
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,940
Mr Park. Did you look into what I asked?

796
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,820
Yes. Just as you said,

797
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,640
Hong Gi Pyo was the one responsible for selling under fake labels.

798
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,100
Send me all the documents on the matter.

799
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,740
And check...

800
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,300
how the legal department is doing with the lawsuit.

801
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,840
Yes, Sir. I'll call you back.

802
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,500
If Hong Gi Pyo tells the truth,

803
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,870
things would be resolved smoothly.

804
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,500
Hey, lady.

805
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,600
Hey, lady.

806
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,770
You should respond when someone talks to you. Hey.

807
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,340
What the...

808
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,370
You're the guy from yesterday.

809
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,870
What? Are you here to buy more grapes?

810
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,570
No, that's not it.

811
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,300
Granny, where's your daughter-in-law who was working here yesterday?

812
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,370
Granny?

813
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,840
- Do I look that old to you?
 -  Pardon?

814
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,320
I'm sorry.

815
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,630
Where's your daughter-in-law?

816
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,840
Why do you care?

817
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,530
Your son is Hong Gi Pyo, correct?

818
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:10,180
It's because I think I can help your son in jail.

819
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,040
- You'll help my son?
 -  Yes.

820
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,870
So where is your daughter-in-law?

821
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,540
- Enjoy.
 -  Thank you.

(Sweet Grapes for Sale)

823
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,070
I meant to go up yesterday, but it was too busy at the orchard.

824
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,040
Don't worry about us and take your time.

825
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,740
The shop is closed, so there's nothing to do anyway.

826
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,870
Mr Lee hasn't called, has he?

827
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,470
You'll be the first person I call if I hear from him.

828
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,270
Don't worry too much.

829
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,130
He'll come back after clearing his head.

830
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,470
The more time passes,

831
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,600
I feel more and more nervous.

832
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,810
Don't be so weak.

833
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,270
And don't skip your meals just because you don't have an appetite.

834
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Okay.

835
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,670
Okay. I'll see you tonight.

Hello!

00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,900
A box of grapes sweeter than sugar is only 18 dollars!

00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,370
Hello...

840
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,800
What now?

841
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,570
I need to check something, so come with me.

842
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,030
To where?

843
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,180
I checked the documents back at my office,

844
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,240
and Hong Gi Pyo, your husband, seems to be a victim, as well.

845
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,200
What do you mean?

846
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,050
I can't tell you anything yet.

847
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,660
Let's go see your husband first.

848
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,100
I need to ask him a few things first.

849
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,190
Why would I trust you enough to go with you?

850
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,940
I'm trying to help your husband.

851
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,290
- Still. I can't go now.
 -  Why not?

852
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,340
My mother-in-law said not to budge until I sell everything here.

853
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,250
I can't move until I sell every box of grapes.

854
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,170
This is insane.

855
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,170
How many boxes are there?

856
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,290
20 boxes.

857
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,490
How much is that?

858
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:56,540
(18 dollars per box)

859
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,900
What?

860
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,540
It was 20 dollars yesterday. Why is it 18 dollars today?

861
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,180
- Did you scam me yesterday?
 -  I don't know anything.

862
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,870
I just did as my mother-in-law said.

863
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,540
What a joke.

864
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,600

I have no time. Let's go.

871
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,900
Has your husband told you about Chief Director Min Hyo Sang...

872
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,840
I mean, CEO Min Hyo Sang?

873
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,120
Why do you ask?

874
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,270
Tell me anything you know about why he was arrested and...

875
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,040
why he's in jail.

876
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,500
You were so rude yesterday and accused me of being a criminal.

00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,040
Are you interviewing me today?

878
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,970
I'm sorry about yesterday.

879
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,370
Everything was going wrong, and it was also hot and annoying.

880
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,800
I apologise. I'm sorry.

881
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,670
I wasn't any better, either.

882
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,040
Do you really not know anything?

883
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,640
It's because I think Hong Gi Pyo may have been framed.

884
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,850
If we can clear up the misunderstanding,

885
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:35,100
I may be able to help him get out of jail.

886
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,900
Did your husband ever tell you anything about being framed?

887
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,240
At first, he said he was framed,

888
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,370
but he denied it later.

889
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,670
Can you really help him get out of jail?

890
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,570
If you cooperate.

00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,770

00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,870
He came to help you,

894
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,770
so answer everything he asks.

895
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,670
Why would he help me?

896
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,970
Who are you?

897
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,900
You sold Meesa Apparel's products under fake labels.

898
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,900
I know Min Hyo Sang is involved, so tell me the truth.

899
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,000
That's the only way I can help you.

900
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,070
What are you talking about?

901
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,270
Min Hyo Sang? Who's that?

902
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:14,400
What are you saying? You know Mr Min Hyo Sang well.

903
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,940
He's his brother-in-law.

904
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,170
Tell me the truth, so that we can claim extenuating circumstances...

905
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,770
I don't know what you're talking about.

906
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,140
I've never heard the name Min Hyo Sang before,

907
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,140
so stop bugging me and please leave.

908
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,160
I don't know what deal you made with my brother-in-law, but...

909
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,660
I said I don't know any Min Hyo Sang, so get lost!

910
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,000
Lower your voice, or this visitation is over.

911
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,130
Stop your gibberish and get lost.

912
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,270
You shouldn't trust my brother-in-law too much.

913
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,470
If you change your mind, tell your wife to contact me.

914
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,060
What's wrong with you?

915
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,930
He said he'd help you get out.

916
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,470
You fool. Can't you tell? He's a bad man.

917
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:09,970
He lied to you so that he could attack me and Mr Min.

918
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,710
Why? For what?

919
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,870
I'm not sure.

920
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,070
But don't talk to him if he comes back, okay?

921
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,540
Then is everything he said true?

922
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,390
Why did you do that?

923
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,400
I...

924
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,570
Stay out of it.

925
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,890
Wait one year, and I'll let you live comfortably.

926
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,900
Don't worry. You trust me, right?

927
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,270
And if he bugs you again, report him the police. Okay?

928
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Maybe it's going to rain. My surgical spot is aching.

929
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,900
Does it hurt a lot?

930
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,740
It'll get better with some rest.

931
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,770
I need to go in and rest. Give my mum my regards.

932
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,940
I'm done here.

933
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,570
Get in.

934
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,040
I'll drive you to the orchard, so get in.

935
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,140
Have you no shame?

936
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,590
Who? Me?

937
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,170
How could you not apologise after lying to me?

938
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,450
What lie did I tell you?

939
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,660
At first, you acted like Min Hyo Sang, the CEO,

940
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,170
and now, you lied that you'd help Gi Pyo get out.

941
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,720
I never said I was Min Hyo Sang.

942
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,040
You're the one who mistook me.

943
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,000
As for your husband, he has to tell the truth for me to help.

944
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,640
What can I do when he lies and just gets upset?

945
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,530
Wait a second. Why are you speaking rudely again?

946
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,200
You can be rude too if you want.

947
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,500
Do you think I can't?

948
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,660
Anyway, don't show your face again!

949
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,270
I'll report you to the police.

950
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,670
What's his problem?

951
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,240
Hyo Sang definitely made him do it.

952
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,040
(Sam Do)

953
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,870
Hi, Sam Do.

954
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,200
I've been thinking about it for the past few days,

955
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,820
and I think Mr Lee left home because of the tailor shop.

956
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,030
The tailor shop?

957
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:33,740
He left home because he was hurt and heartbroken...

958
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:37,610
that there's no one to pass the shop down to.

959
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,510
That's what it said in his letter, too.

960
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,620
He said to close the shop while he's away.

961
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,270
- That's true.
 -  Dong Jin.

962
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,120
- Can you really not do it?
 -  Do what?

963
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,150
The tailor shop. Are you really not interested in running it?

964
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:53,260
Come on. How could I run the shop?

965
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,860
Why not? You've seen enough.

966
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,580
That was a long time ago. There's no way.

967
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,770
You really won't take over the shop?

968
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,470
No. I really won't.

969
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,040
Then I guess I'm the only one.

970
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,170
With whom are you whispering?

971
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,470
Fine. Bye.

972
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,390
Whom were you talking to?

973
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,330
I talked to the woman who touched my biceps. So what?

974
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:15,480
What?

975
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,500
I called Dong Jin to talk about Mr Lee. Happy?

976
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,570
You scared me.

977
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,320
I know I said it already, but you have serious paranoia.

978
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,100
You need to get treated.

979
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,020
Forget it. I'll just live with it.

980
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,340
Why do I have to put up with it when I did nothing wrong?

981
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,500
You did nothing wrong?

982
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,440
You stole my heart completely.

983
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,840
Bae Sam Do, you must serve a life sentence.

984
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,660
I'm speechless.

985
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,740
Look how cute.

986
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,750
I almost forgot about you. Why are you back?

987
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,640
Bae Sam Do, you destroyed my guitar. You...

988
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,530
must serve a life sentence.

989
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:57,000
What are you doing?

990
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,170
Are you okay?

991
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,470
Stop it.

992
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,660
I came to participate in the new drug study.

993
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,670

Kang Tae Yang.

Do you see the beds over there?

996
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,580
Go to the one with your name on it and wait.

997
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,640
Okay.

998
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,400
Do we get paid as soon as the study is over?

999
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,740
If everything goes well, it'll be deposited within a week.

1000
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Thank you.

(Clothing Inventory and Returns Report)

1003
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,200
Hong Gi Pyo changed many of the labels...

1004
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,170
for the old items with labels from the new releases.

1005
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:06,240
The pure dollar amount makes it unlikely that he did it alone.

1006
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,970
How is the lawsuit going?

1007
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,860
As soon as Min Hyo Sang was inaugurated as CEO,

1008
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,950
there were orders that his office would handle the lawsuit,

1009
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,600
so the legal department was unable to proceed.

1010
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,070
Hello, Mother.

1011
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,600
I just got to Seoul. I'm on the local bus headed home now.

1012
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,770
There are some grapes missing. It's your doing, isn't it?

1013
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:46,640
I told you I was taking some to give to the tailor shop adults.

1014
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,040
I told you to take the ones I put aside to make juice.

1015
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,000
I didn't tell you to take the ones for sale.

1016

You softy.

1017
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,780
Do you know how much each box costs?

1018
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,650
Then dock it from my pay for the past two days.

1019
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:01,070
Are you giving your mother-in-law an attitude?

1020
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,990
I'm only kidding.
