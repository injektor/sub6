<font color="yellow">You got it all wrong. That was...</font>

6
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,239
<font color="yellow">You hypocrite.</font>

7
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,639

00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,069
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

13
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:45,839
<font color="yellow">Stop right there. I'm not done talking.</font>

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,439

<font color="yellow">I didn't do it on purpose.</font>

17
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:31,169
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

18
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,039

00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:11,009

<font color="yellow">from transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates.</font>

33
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,079
<font color="yellow">The public will think that Meesa is corrupt,</font>

34
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,309
<font color="yellow">and the late chairman will be painted as a corrupt businessman.</font>

<font color="yellow">No. I made a stop on my way home.</font>

40

41

<font color="yellow">Ms Geum, do you think...</font>

43
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,709
<font color="yellow">I'm an evil, two-faced person who pretends to be naive...</font>

44
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,439
<font color="yellow">when I'm around others but is actually selfish?</font>

45
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,539
<font color="yellow">If someone acts out of character,</font>

46
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,809
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you assume something's wrong...</font>

47
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:23,439
<font color="yellow">and wait until they're able to explain?</font>

48
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,209
<font color="yellow">Isn't it wrong to misunderstand an be judgemental?</font>

49
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,439
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what you're talking about.</font>

50
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,639
<font color="yellow">Be more specific so I'll understand.</font>

51
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:32,839
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

52
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,869
<font color="yellow">I'm tired. I should just go to bed.</font>

53

<font color="yellow">How did you know I'd be here?</font>

57
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,469
<font color="yellow">I called the bar to ask and they said you were here.</font>

58
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:22,039
<font color="yellow">Are you still trying to decide whether to pick me or the employees?</font>

59
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:23,669
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

60
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,409
<font color="yellow">- What is it now? - Your dad...</font>

61
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:30,009
<font color="yellow">wired Mother some allowance every month.</font>

62
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,709
<font color="yellow">Hyo Sang wants to...</font>

63
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,309
<font color="yellow">report it to the authorities as an illegal slush fund.</font>

64
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,439
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

65
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,769
<font color="yellow">He wants to report the money that went to his own mother?</font>

66
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,769
<font color="yellow">He's doing that so he can fire the director of finance who is my ally.</font>

67
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,039
<font color="yellow">Above all,</font>

68
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,709
<font color="yellow">he probably knows that I won't fight for Meesa's ownership...</font>

69
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,769
<font color="yellow">at the expense of the your late father.</font>

70
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,709
<font color="yellow">He has lost his mind.</font>

71
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,109
<font color="yellow">Did you meet on the way home?</font>

72
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,839
<font color="yellow">- Were you on a date? - A date?</font>

73
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,939
<font color="yellow">In this situation?</font>

74
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:18,209
<font color="yellow">You came in together, so I assumed you had a good time.</font>

75
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:19,969
<font color="yellow">Too bad if you didn't.</font>

76
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,009
<font color="yellow">You thick-faced witch.</font>

77
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,569
<font color="yellow">You used my dad when he was alive,</font>

78
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,339
<font color="yellow">and now you're defaming him.</font>

79
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,009
<font color="yellow">You aren't even human!</font>

80
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,739
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? What does she mean?</font>

81
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,469
<font color="yellow">You should ask your precious son.</font>

82
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,909
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Let's go upstairs.</font>

83
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:46,839
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

84
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:48,109
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

85
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,939
<font color="yellow">- Tell me the truth. - About what?</font>

86
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,409
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo said you're defaming your dad.</font>

87
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:57,939
<font color="yellow">What does she mean?</font>

88
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,139
<font color="yellow">Oh, that? It's the ace up my sleeve.</font>

89
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,769
<font color="yellow">What is this ace?</font>

90
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,539
<font color="yellow">Dad wired you some money every month.</font>

91
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,239
<font color="yellow">I threatened to tell the prosecutors about it.</font>

92
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,309
<font color="yellow">- What? - Don't worry.</font>

93
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:15,169
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin adored the old man. He wouldn't risk his reputation.</font>

94
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,069
<font color="yellow">- Wake up, you fool. - What was that for?</font>

95
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,339
<font color="yellow">I know you want to own Meesa, but you can't use your own dad!</font>

96
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,069
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

97
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,809
<font color="yellow">We decided to keep the store.</font>

98
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,509
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin came by today to pay the penalty.</font>

99
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,769
<font color="yellow">Sam Do will move in as soon as possible...</font>

100
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,009
<font color="yellow">and reopen the store.</font>

101
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,839
<font color="yellow">You don't have to spend too much time on the road.</font>

102
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,569
<font color="yellow">Come home as soon as you can, okay?</font>

103
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,209
<font color="yellow">What's that noise?</font>

104
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:14,239
<font color="yellow">It would taste even better with three drops of sesame oil.</font>

105
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,409
<font color="yellow">I wonder where they keep it.</font>

106
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,639
<font color="yellow">- Thief! - My goodness.</font>

107
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,739
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

108
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,139
<font color="yellow">It's you, Leather Jacket.</font>

109
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,039
<font color="yellow">- What? - Hello, it's me, Jun.</font>

110
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,209
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in my kitchen?</font>

111
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,809
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook said I could come downstairs and eat...</font>

112
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,639
<font color="yellow">whatever's in the fridge if I ever felt hungry.</font>

113
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,239
<font color="yellow">Even so.</font>

114
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:54,039
<font color="yellow">You can't sneak in and eat without my permission.</font>

115
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,409
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

116
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:01,839
<font color="yellow">I jumped when you shrieked and spilled the sesame oil.</font>

117
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,069
<font color="yellow">The sesame oil?</font>

118
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,439
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. My goodness.</font>

119
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,469
<font color="yellow">Do you know how expensive this is?</font>

120
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,169
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

121
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,839
<font color="yellow">It's not the imported stuff.</font>

122
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,809
<font color="yellow">I bought Korean-grown sesame seeds and watched...</font>

123
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,739
<font color="yellow">and waited at the mill to make sure they got every drop.</font>

124
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,109
<font color="yellow">What a waste.</font>

125
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,569
<font color="yellow">I should have been more careful.</font>

126
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,969
<font color="yellow">This would have lasted us more than three months.</font>

127
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,309
<font color="yellow">It's all gone.</font>

128
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,509
<font color="yellow">This is terrible.</font>

129
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,169
<font color="yellow">I did a terrible thing.</font>

130
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,239
<font color="yellow">The bottle was full to the brim.</font>

131
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:42,479
<font color="yellow">Now there's less than half left. What should I do about this?</font>

132
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,139
<font color="yellow">I will buy you a new bottle.</font>

133
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,069
<font color="yellow">- Will you? - Yes.</font>

134
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,939
<font color="yellow">I'll get you a new bottle of Korean-grown sesame oil.</font>

135
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,869
<font color="yellow">You do that, then.</font>

136
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,369
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

137
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,479
<font color="yellow">Give me that bottle.</font>

138
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,939
<font color="yellow">I said I'd buy you a bottle of it, so you can give me that.</font>

139
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,439
<font color="yellow">Fine, then.</font>

140
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:21,069
<font color="yellow">This is the good stuff.</font>

141
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,639
<font color="yellow">My goodness. That's disgusting.</font>

142
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,769
<font color="yellow">Do the dishes when you're done.</font>

143
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,439
<font color="yellow">I will. Don't worry.</font>

144
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,939
<font color="yellow">This is enough to last me three years.</font>

145
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,609
<font color="yellow">There we go. Korean sesame oil is precious.</font>

146
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,439
<font color="yellow">It tastes lovely.</font>

147
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,769
<font color="yellow">He doesn't think like most people his age.</font>

148
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:58,239
<font color="yellow">"I'll buy you a bottle of Korean sesame oil."</font>

149
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,909
<font color="yellow">"You can keep whatever's left of this bottle."</font>

150
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:04,569
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it have been nice if he had said that instead?</font>

151
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,409
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

152
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:08,909
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Mum?</font>

153
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,109
<font color="yellow">Ouch. That hurt.</font>

154
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,239
<font color="yellow">Do you think before you speak?</font>

155
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,639
<font color="yellow">What is it now?</font>

156
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:19,309
<font color="yellow">Did you tell Leather Jacket to come down when he's hungry...</font>

157
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,869
<font color="yellow">and eat whatever food's in the fridge?</font>

158
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,609
<font color="yellow">Do we run a charity?</font>

159
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:27,709
<font color="yellow">We should help those in need if we live under the same roof.</font>

160
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,209
<font color="yellow">- I told him to eat our food. - What?</font>

161
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,439
<font color="yellow">Will he eat with us three times a day?</font>

162
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,939
<font color="yellow">Jun isn't that rude or presumptuous.</font>

163
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,809
<font color="yellow">It's just for a while until Sam Do moves in.</font>

164
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,769
<font color="yellow">What does Sam Do moving in...</font>

165
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,839
<font color="yellow">have to do with us feeding Leather Jacket?</font>

166
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,639
<font color="yellow">He'll share the appliances with Sam Do when he moves in.</font>

167
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,009
<font color="yellow">Do you mean Leather Jacket doesn't have anything?</font>

168
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,709
<font color="yellow">The stuff he brought when he moved in, was that it?</font>

169
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,539
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

170
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:03,209
<font color="yellow">He looks fine, but he's practically penniless.</font>

171
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,709
<font color="yellow">You never know what will happen.</font>

172
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,439
<font color="yellow">When his next single becomes a hit,</font>

173
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,169
<font color="yellow">he can buy 10 houses like this one.</font>

174
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,569
<font color="yellow">When will that be?</font>

175
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,939
<font color="yellow">That hurt.</font>

176
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,339
<font color="yellow">My goodness. How much have you eaten?</font>

177
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,309
<font color="yellow">How many chickens did you eat?</font>

178
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,809
<font color="yellow">Can't a fried chicken seller eat her own chicken?</font>

179
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,139
<font color="yellow">Don't talk like that to me.</font>

180
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,569
<font color="yellow">How many bottles of soju did you drink?</font>

181
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,469
<font color="yellow">I drank a few bottles because...</font>

182
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:50,139
<font color="yellow">I feel so lonely and desolate that I pity myself and my life.</font>

183
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,809
<font color="yellow">Why are you so lonely and desolate?</font>

184
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,239
<font color="yellow">The other store owners...</font>

185
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,239
<font color="yellow">won't talk to me any more.</font>

186
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:02,209
<font color="yellow">They leave me out of everything.</font>

187
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:06,469
<font color="yellow">The dried seafood lady, oil lady and fishmonger...</font>

188
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:09,469
<font color="yellow">went to eat lunch without me.</font>

189
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:12,909
<font color="yellow">It's your fault for using your dead mum.</font>

190
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,939
<font color="yellow">It takes two to tango, you know.</font>

191
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,109
<font color="yellow">You ruined everything by telling the truth.</font>

192
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,609
<font color="yellow">You're insane.</font>

193
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,139
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell them it's your dead mum's 80th birthday?</font>

194
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,939
<font color="yellow">What else should I have done?</font>

195
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,869
<font color="yellow">Once we move to Seoul,</font>

196
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:36,969
<font color="yellow">we'll never get back the money we gave out at their parties.</font>

197
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,209
<font color="yellow">I wanted to...</font>

198
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,239
<font color="yellow">make them pay up before we moved.</font>

199
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,339
<font color="yellow">Are you that crazy about money?</font>

200
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,409
<font color="yellow">Let's go home. We can clean up tomorrow.</font>

201
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,809
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

202
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,069
<font color="yellow">Can't you even stand up straight?</font>

203
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:56,709
<font color="yellow">Are you that drunk already?</font>

204
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,309
<font color="yellow">How much did you drink?</font>

205
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,369
<font color="yellow">- Carry me. - What? What did you say?</font>

206
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,739
<font color="yellow">- Give me a piggyback. - This is unbelievable.</font>

207
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,539
<font color="yellow">You're fine in every other way,</font>

208
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,239
<font color="yellow">but you care too much about money.</font>

209
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:16,539
<font color="yellow">That's your crucial flaw.</font>

210
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,409
<font color="yellow">I bet that when you were born,</font>

211
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,969
<font color="yellow">you came out screaming "money".</font>

212
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,769
<font color="yellow">It's not nice to always talk about money.</font>

213
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,669
<font color="yellow">Spend more than you earn, and you'll end up penniless.</font>

214
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,769
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

215
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,939
<font color="yellow">I'm more afraid of losing friends than money.</font>

216
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,039
<font color="yellow">What you did today...</font>

217
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:39,869
<font color="yellow">ruined friendships we'd built up for years.</font>

218
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,639
<font color="yellow">Now we have to move to Seoul as if we're on the run.</font>

219
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,239
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to have such a horrible ending...</font>

220
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,239
<font color="yellow">to the great few years we had?</font>

221
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,409
<font color="yellow">You're all about emotions and ties and if I leave it all to you,</font>

222
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,569
<font color="yellow">we'll end up with nothing to our name.</font>

223
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,339
<font color="yellow">It's not worth being abandoned by friends...</font>

224
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,969
<font color="yellow">so we can live in a palace.</font>

225
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,969
<font color="yellow">It's much better to get along with others...</font>

226
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,569
<font color="yellow">and share what we have even if we live in a tiny space.</font>

227
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:16,939
<font color="yellow">We don't have kids to take us in later on.</font>

228
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:19,109
<font color="yellow">When I'm dead and you're poor,</font>

229
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:23,609
<font color="yellow">you'll be left alone, and no one will care about you.</font>

230
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,909
<font color="yellow">I want to earn a fortune for you before I die...</font>

231
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,569
<font color="yellow">so that gold-diggers will hang around...</font>

232
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,639
<font color="yellow">even if they may be old hags with dentures.</font>

233
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,139
<font color="yellow">You worry too much for your own good.</font>

234
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,439
<font color="yellow">People cursed you out so much that I bet...</font>

235
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,839
<font color="yellow">you will outlive me by at least 20 years.</font>

236
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,109
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

237
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,109
<font color="yellow">The number of women I grabbed by the hair is...</font>

238
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,409
<font color="yellow">at least 10.</font>

239
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,039
<font color="yellow">It's way more than that.</font>

240
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:00,239
<font color="yellow">Count all your fingers and toes...</font>

241
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:02,139
<font color="yellow">and add five to that.</font>

242
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,909
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

243
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:08,939
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

244
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,609
<font color="yellow">Why did you defend me earlier?</font>

245
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:17,409
<font color="yellow">You used to call me ignorant and tried to shut me up.</font>

246
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,209
<font color="yellow">Why not today?</font>

247
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:23,809
<font color="yellow">I was grateful.</font>

248
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,669
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

249
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,469
<font color="yellow">You hate anything about tailoring and suits.</font>

250
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:35,339
<font color="yellow">But you feared for me...</font>

251
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,739
<font color="yellow">and gave in to me.</font>

252
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,709
<font color="yellow">I was grateful for that.</font>

253
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,339
<font color="yellow">You've grown up at last.</font>

254
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,539
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

255
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,509
<font color="yellow">How about you? When will you grow up?</font>

256
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,309
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

257
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:54,439
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

258
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:56,809
<font color="yellow">Don't hit me. I can barely carry you.</font>

259
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,409
<font color="yellow">You don't mean that.</font>

260
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,969
<font color="yellow">I do mean that. You're heavier than a sack of rice.</font>

261
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,239
<font color="yellow">What? A sack of what?</font>

262
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,569
<font color="yellow">- That's nonsense. - Don't move. I might drop you.</font>

263
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,169
<font color="yellow">- That's a lie. - I'll drop you.</font>

264
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,439
<font color="yellow">- I'm not rice. - Be quiet.</font>

265
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,239
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

266
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,739
<font color="yellow">Sam Do...</font>

267
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:40,209
<font color="yellow">You're selfish, but you pretend to be naive in front of others.</font>

268
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,469
<font color="yellow">Aren't you tired of being two-faced?</font>

269
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,739
<font color="yellow">You got it all wrong. That was...</font>

270
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:46,869
<font color="yellow">You hypocrite.</font>

271
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,709
<font color="yellow">A hypocrite? How could he say that?</font>

272
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,969
<font color="yellow">My gosh, it's so hot.</font>

273
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,639
<font color="yellow">Ouch...</font>

274
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:07,909
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel like crying when I eat something hot?</font>

275
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:32,569
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

276
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,509
<font color="yellow">Come and join me.</font>

277
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:36,039
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

278
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,609
<font color="yellow">It's been over 30 years.</font>

279
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:43,569
<font color="yellow">That's how long people mocked me for being the other woman.</font>

280
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,809
<font color="yellow">It's been over 30 years.</font>

281
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,869
<font color="yellow">Do you know what made me hang on?</font>

282
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,569
<font color="yellow">The dream of making Hyo Sang the owner of Meesa Apparel.</font>

283
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,639
<font color="yellow">That was my only goal.</font>

284
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,509
<font color="yellow">I know that makes me seem shallow,</font>

285
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,309
<font color="yellow">but without that goal,</font>

286
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:11,139
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have made it this far.</font>

287
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,369
<font color="yellow">You're drunk. You should go to bed.</font>

288
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,539
<font color="yellow">The same goes for Hyo Sang.</font>

289
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,869
<font color="yellow">He's going to the extreme and defaming his own father.</font>

290
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,739
<font color="yellow">I know you don't think much of him for that.</font>

291
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,469
<font color="yellow">But that's just how desperate we are.</font>

292
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,339
<font color="yellow">Do you think that justifies this?</font>

293
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,179
<font color="yellow">Help us out, Dong Jin.</font>

294
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,539
<font color="yellow">It's late. You should stop drinking.</font>

295
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:37,909
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking as your mother-in-law.</font>

296
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,839
<font color="yellow">I'm asking as...</font>

297
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:44,239
<font color="yellow">Eun Sook who used to work at Wolgyesu Tailor Shop.</font>

298
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,309
<font color="yellow">Please help us out.</font>

299
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,679
<font color="yellow">(I'll be away for a few days to clear my head.)</font>

300
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,139
<font color="yellow">What is he thinking?</font>

301
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:51,439
<font color="yellow">The phone has been turned off. Please leave a message after...</font>

302
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,769
<font color="yellow">Where is he with his phone turned off?</font>

303
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,679
<font color="yellow">Is he crazy?</font>

304
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,339
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mum.</font>

305
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:06,039
<font color="yellow">I'm going on a business trip, so I might be hard to reach.</font>

306
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,809
<font color="yellow">Don't worry if I don't pick up my phone.</font>

307
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,909
<font color="yellow">I'll call you when I return to Seoul.</font>

308

<font color="yellow">(Wife)</font>

309
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,139
<font color="yellow">(Power off)</font>

310
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,909
<font color="yellow">Your husband's trial starts today.</font>

311
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,569
<font color="yellow">Leave the store to me.</font>

312
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,909
<font color="yellow">There's still time. I'll help you finish up.</font>

313
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,569
<font color="yellow">Is your mother-in-law coming?</font>

314
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,869
<font color="yellow">No. Gi Pyo told her not to come all the way to Seoul.</font>

315
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,139
<font color="yellow">I'll be there alone.</font>

316
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,509
<font color="yellow">Are you cleaning up?</font>

317
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:03,909
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

318
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:08,469
<font color="yellow">We've been distracted for a while, so the whole place is a mess.</font>

319
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,869
<font color="yellow">It's so clean now that even a fly would slip and fall.</font>

320
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,739
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil came in at the crack of dawn.</font>

321
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,739
<font color="yellow">She's good at everything she does.</font>

322
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:21,409
<font color="yellow">I know she is. She's diligent and meticulous...</font>

323
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,869
<font color="yellow">and perfect in every way.</font>

324
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,439
<font color="yellow">Even if Gi Pyo threatens you, don't ever sign the marriage licence.</font>

325
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,069
<font color="yellow">- Promise me that. - Okay.</font>

326
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:34,469
<font color="yellow">I'll marry you off to a better man if I find one.</font>

327
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,709
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything to mess up my plans.</font>

328
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,239
<font color="yellow">Don't say things like that.</font>

329
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,409
<font color="yellow">I have to go to court now.</font>

330
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,439
<font color="yellow">It's Gi Pyo's first hearing.</font>

331
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:47,679
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go on, then. Don't worry about us.</font>

332
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:48,869
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

333
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,469
<font color="yellow">(Sun Nyeo Chicken)</font>

334
00:21:56,239 --> 00:22:00,039
<font color="yellow">Don't sit there and sulk. Go and make amends.</font>

335
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,739
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what I told you yesterday?</font>

336
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:08,039
<font color="yellow">The dried seafood lady, oil lady and fishmonger ate lunch without me.</font>

337
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:10,869
<font color="yellow">What? Without you?</font>

338
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,739
<font color="yellow">I should teach those three a lesson.</font>

339
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,169
<font color="yellow">Forget it. They'll just say I'm bragging that I'm married.</font>

340
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:19,639
<font color="yellow">They were all widowed.</font>

341
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,409
<font color="yellow">15 years ago for the dried seafood lady, 8 years ago for the oil lady,</font>

342
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:23,869
<font color="yellow">and three years ago for the fishmonger.</font>

343
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:26,939
<font color="yellow">That's why you, the woman with the great husband,</font>

344
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:30,869
<font color="yellow">should hand out an olive branch and try to patch things up.</font>

345
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,339
<font color="yellow">No. I have nothing to lose.</font>

346
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,869
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

347
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,369
<font color="yellow">I fried you these.</font>

348
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:46,169
<font color="yellow">Go and share it with them or you'll regret it forever.</font>

349
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,409
<font color="yellow">If you do as I say, then your lovely Sam Do...</font>

350
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,009
<font color="yellow">will give you a long kiss.</font>

351
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:04,309
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

352
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:06,409
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

353
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,869
<font color="yellow">Or here?</font>

354
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:13,409
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

355
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,909
<font color="yellow">What if people see?</font>

356
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:19,169
<font color="yellow">I'll kiss you again if you don't go right away.</font>

357
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,209
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

358
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,909
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

359
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:32,409
<font color="yellow">I'd rather not listen to you and get another kiss.</font>

360
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:37,909
<font color="yellow">Don't push your luck. Take what you're given.</font>

361
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,369
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

362
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:42,969
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

363
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:45,309
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll go, okay?</font>

364
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,839
<font color="yellow">It was so funny.</font>

365
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:54,939
<font color="yellow">- They are hilarious. - I know.</font>

366
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,469
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Seriously.</font>

367
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,669
<font color="yellow">- Have some chicken. - No thanks.</font>

368
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,439
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of what you'll ask from us if we do.</font>

369
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,039
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about what I did yesterday.</font>

370
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:17,769
<font color="yellow">I gave out a lot of money to your birthdays and funerals,</font>

371
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:21,969
<font color="yellow">and the idea of moving away made me want to collect on it.</font>

372
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:26,409
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry. I cared too much about the money.</font>

373
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:27,709
<font color="yellow">When are you leaving?</font>

374
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,739
<font color="yellow">The landlord wants to move right in.</font>

375
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,409
<font color="yellow">And the business was good, so a lot of people want to buy us out.</font>

376
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:35,739
<font color="yellow">We'll be gone in a few days.</font>

377
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,069
<font color="yellow">That soon?</font>

378
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,509
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd need at least two months.</font>

379
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:44,409
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

380
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,769
<font color="yellow">Are you upset that I'll be gone so soon?</font>

381
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:51,539
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - Be nice to me when I'm still here.</font>

382
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,709
<font color="yellow">- Eat this. - My goodness.</font>

383
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,869
<font color="yellow">Don't regret it once I'm gone.</font>

384
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,509
<font color="yellow">Here. You, too.</font>

385
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:02,769
<font color="yellow">Look at you three.</font>

386
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,969
<font color="yellow">- What a sight this is. - What?</font>

387
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,469
<font color="yellow">I need a photo of this.</font>

388
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,909
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3.</font>

389
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,739
<font color="yellow">Move in closer. Three. Click.</font>

390
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,169
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

391
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,439
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you at your store?</font>

392
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:21,639
<font color="yellow">I hired a part-timer.</font>

393
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,039
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

394
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,569
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm going to Hongdae to go busking.</font>

395
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,009
<font color="yellow">Bus... What's that?</font>

396
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,639
<font color="yellow">It's called "busking".</font>

397
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:33,609
<font color="yellow">It's when musicians perform for the public.</font>

398
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:36,469
<font color="yellow">I basically perform in the streets.</font>

399
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,869
<font color="yellow">- Can you make money? - Of course.</font>

400
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,239
<font color="yellow">People who are touched or impressed...</font>

401
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,439
<font color="yellow">leave money in my guitar case as they go by.</font>

402
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,109
<font color="yellow">If I needed money when I lived in Manhattan,</font>

403
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:50,439
<font color="yellow">I would busk in Central Park.</font>

404
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,639
<font color="yellow">That is so romantic.</font>

405
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,239
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

406
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,839
<font color="yellow">You're basically a snake oil merchant.</font>

407
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,239
<font color="yellow">I'm not, Ms Choi.</font>

408
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,909
<font color="yellow">Back in my day, markets were held every five days.</font>

409
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:05,069
<font color="yellow">And snake oil merchants painted their faces white...</font>

410
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:08,969
<font color="yellow">and carried a drum on their backs and sang and danced.</font>

411
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,669
<font color="yellow">They sold snake oil and rat poison.</font>

412
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:14,139
<font color="yellow">Snake oil and rat poison?</font>

413
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,869
<font color="yellow">How could you compare...</font>

414
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:19,339
<font color="yellow">a musician to a snake oil merchant from years ago?</font>

415
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:21,639
<font color="yellow">You're such an embarrassment.</font>

416
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:26,739
<font color="yellow">Don't let it get to you. She's old and doesn't get it.</font>

417
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,909
<font color="yellow">We should go.</font>

418
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:29,509
<font color="yellow">Bye, Ms Choi.</font>

419
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,439
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

420
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,809
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? - Where else?</font>

421
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,009
<font color="yellow">I'm off to watch him perform.</font>

422
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:42,139
<font color="yellow">- Why would you go there? - Why do you think?</font>

423
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,009
<font color="yellow">It's his first official performance since his return.</font>

424
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:47,739
<font color="yellow">It's my duty as his neighbour to cheer him on.</font>

425
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,309
<font color="yellow">- Do you have feelings for him? - What?</font>

426
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:54,069
<font color="yellow">I don't. I do not, Mum.</font>

427
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,069
<font color="yellow">You can't fool me.</font>

428
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:58,339
<font color="yellow">The way you look at him...</font>

429
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:02,309
<font color="yellow">reminds me of a catfish with an eye problem.</font>

430
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,039
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare lie.</font>

431
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:08,639
<font color="yellow">I'm Sung Jun and in 2000, I received the Best New Artist Award.</font>

432
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,739
<font color="yellow">It's been 15 years,</font>

433
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:14,439
<font color="yellow">but I'm finally back.</font>

434
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,509
<font color="yellow">This is my first official performance,</font>

435
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:21,539
<font color="yellow">and it's an honour and privilege to sing for you.</font>

436
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,809
<font color="yellow">I will sing the historical hit that you all remember.</font>

437
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,139
<font color="yellow">This is "Susanna's Handkerchief". I hope you enjoy it.</font>

438
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:36,109
<font color="yellow">When I looked at your beautiful face</font>

439
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:38,969
<font color="yellow">Children, you shouldn't listen to things like this.</font>

440
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:40,669
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

441
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:44,339
<font color="yellow">- Da Yul, Jin Young, let's go. - Bye.</font>

442
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,669
<font color="yellow">Walk hand-in-hand.</font>

443
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,009
<font color="yellow">- Ducks... - Quack.</font>

444
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,969
<font color="yellow">- Chicks... - Chirp.</font>

445
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,709
<font color="yellow">- Ducks... - Quack.</font>

446
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,439
<font color="yellow">- Chicks... - Chirp.</font>

447
00:27:54,569 --> 00:28:00,239
<font color="yellow">Hand me your handkerchief</font>

448
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:04,539
<font color="yellow">You used to always tell me</font>

449
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:10,969
<font color="yellow">(Tae Joon)</font>

450
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,069
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - You sound terrible.</font>

451
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,285
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

452
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:25,009
<font color="yellow">No. Is something wrong?</font>

453
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:27,706
<font color="yellow">Mum went to Seoul. She should be there by now.</font>

454
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:28,997
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from her?</font>

455
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,909
<font color="yellow">Why did she come to Seoul?</font>

00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,907
<font color="yellow">She went to say hello.</font>

458
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:38,739
<font color="yellow">She hurt her leg. You should've...</font>

459
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:41,739
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's hang up for now.</font>

460
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,569
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

461
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,239
<font color="yellow">I'm here to meet Choi Ji Yun. She's an announcer here.</font>

462
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,139
<font color="yellow">Who shall I say is here?</font>

463
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,809
<font color="yellow">Tell her that her mum misses her and came to see her.</font>

464
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:06,709
<font color="yellow">She's going to marry my son.</font>

465
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:10,309
<font color="yellow">So she calls me "mum", you see.</font>

466
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:15,239
<font color="yellow">- Ji Yun, are you getting married? - What?</font>

467
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:18,609
<font color="yellow">Your future mother-in-law is in the lobby.</font>

468
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:23,139
<font color="yellow">It must be a prank. I should go and check.</font>

469
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:29,039
<font color="yellow">Over here, my baby. Over here, Ji Yun.</font>

470
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,469
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun.</font>

471
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:34,869
<font color="yellow">- Ji Yun. - Why didn't you call ahead?</font>

472
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:37,809
<font color="yellow">I felt bad that I missed your birthday,</font>

473
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,469
<font color="yellow">and it's been so long since I last saw you.</font>

474
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,009

475
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:47,869
<font color="yellow">- Can you walk a bit faster? - It's good to see you.</font>

477
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,209
<font color="yellow">I missed you too much.</font>

478
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:59,869
<font color="yellow">- I didn't think, my baby. - Stop calling me that.</font>

479
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,739
<font color="yellow">I guess you haven't heard.</font>

480
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,239
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang and I broke up.</font>

481
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:08,239
<font color="yellow">You broke up? Why?</font>

482
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,139
<font color="yellow">He graduated three years ago,</font>

483
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:14,169
<font color="yellow">and he still doesn't have a job. I can't wait any longer.</font>

484
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:17,909
<font color="yellow">I know how hard it is for you.</font>

485
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:21,969
<font color="yellow">I do, but you two have been together for so long.</font>

486
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:24,009
<font color="yellow">We were young and clueless.</font>

487
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:28,909
<font color="yellow">So please don't talk or act like Tae Yang and I are married.</font>

490
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,739
<font color="yellow">I brought you sweet potatoes, your favourite.</font>

491
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:48,239
<font color="yellow">And these are black beans which are good for you.</font>

492
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,569

499
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,169
<font color="yellow">- Why are you using her? - What?</font>

500
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,509
<font color="yellow">Where's your pride? Aren't you upset?</font>

501

756
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:22,139
<font color="yellow">but we all know how caring you are.</font>

757
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:26,739
<font color="yellow">That's right. You attended every sad and happy occasion we had...</font>

758
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:29,539
<font color="yellow">and volunteered to do all the tough jobs.</font>

759
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,609
<font color="yellow">Stop crying.</font>

760
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:37,139
<font color="yellow">I was out of line the other time. I'm sorry.</font>

761
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:39,169
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

762
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:41,609
<font color="yellow">You're moving, so you probably need to buy new things.</font>

763
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:43,039
<font color="yellow">It's not much, but I hope it helps.</font>

764
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,509
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, don't do this. - Stop being silly.</font>

765
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:47,209
<font color="yellow">Buy a new pot with this.</font>

766
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:49,639
<font color="yellow">The one you have now looks so worn out.</font>

767
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:52,969
<font color="yellow">Why do you guys keep touching my heart like this?</font>

768
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:56,469
<font color="yellow">This is from the market committee.</font>

769
00:51:56,569 --> 00:51:58,569
<font color="yellow">We wish you much success in Seoul.</font>

770
00:51:58,569 --> 00:52:00,239
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. You really don't need to do this.</font>

771
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:02,109
<font color="yellow">It's not much. Please just accept it.</font>

772
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:04,239
<font color="yellow">No, we can't accept it. Please take it back.</font>

773
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:07,709
<font color="yellow">The chairman is giving it to us.</font>

774
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,709
<font color="yellow">We should gladly accept it with gratitude.</font>

775
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,809
<font color="yellow">Rejecting it is impolite, Honey.</font>

776
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,539
<font color="yellow">- Aren't I right, Sir? - Yes, you're absolutely right.</font>

777
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:18,809
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

778
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:22,839
<font color="yellow">The Bok Sun Nyeo we know would never reject money.</font>

779
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,309
<font color="yellow">- Is that right? - Yes.</font>

780
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:30,239
<font color="yellow">You, seriously...</font>

781
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:37,909
<font color="yellow">- Best of luck. - Good luck.</font>

782
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,209
<font color="yellow">- That woman is a piece of work. - What now?</font>

783
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:46,809
<font color="yellow">She acted all generous and giving, but she only put in 30 dollars.</font>

784
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:49,639
<font color="yellow">I gave her 50 dollars when her daughter got married.</font>

785
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:52,009
<font color="yellow">Enough is enough, you money greedy woman.</font>

786
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:53,939
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This is ridiculous.</font>

787
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:56,169
<font color="yellow">- I honestly can't believe this. - What is it now?</font>

788
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,239
<font color="yellow">The market committee has so many members.</font>

789
00:52:58,439 --> 00:53:00,369
<font color="yellow">How can they only give us 200 dollars?</font>

790
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:02,139
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's so petty?</font>

791
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,039
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of you going on about money.</font>

792
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:09,139
<font color="yellow">I guess his family had no idea.</font>

793
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:13,439
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Man Sool...</font>

794
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,209
<font color="yellow">has been diagnosed with pigmentary degeneration of the retina.</font>

795
00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:19,969
<font color="yellow">What does that mean, exactly?</font>

796
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:21,509
<font color="yellow">To put it simply,</font>

797
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:23,369
<font color="yellow">information about objects we see with our eyes become...</font>

798
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:26,439
<font color="yellow">converted to the kind of information the optic nerve can decipher...</font>

799
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,669
<font color="yellow">through photoreceptor cells in the retina,</font>

800
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:30,209
<font color="yellow">which gets delivered to the brain.</font>

801
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:31,469
<font color="yellow">Those with this condition...</font>

802
00:53:31,669 --> 00:53:34,209
<font color="yellow">experience gradual deterioration of eyesight...</font>

803
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:36,409
<font color="yellow">caused by impaired function of the photoreceptor cells.</font>

804
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:39,739
<font color="yellow">In the final stage, patients end up losing their eyesight.</font>

805
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,669
<font color="yellow">What do you mean they lose their eyesight?</font>

806
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:47,209
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that my dad will become blind?</font>

807
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,609
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message after the tone.</font>

808
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:06,869
<font color="yellow">Press the star button to end recording.</font>

809
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,039
<font color="yellow">It's me, Dad.</font>

810
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:13,769
<font color="yellow">I met with your doctor today.</font>

811
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:16,039
<font color="yellow">Your eyes...</font>

812
00:54:21,669 --> 00:54:25,609
<font color="yellow">I know that you're losing your eyesight.</font>

813
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:31,969
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

814
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:36,869
<font color="yellow">You may think I'm pathetic, but I'm still your only son.</font>

815
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,369
<font color="yellow">You should have told me.</font>

816
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:43,969
<font color="yellow">How can you make me...</font>

817
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:48,409
<font color="yellow">feel so horrible and helpless as your son?</font>

818
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:27,669
<font color="yellow">Ms Choi!</font>

819
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:29,009
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

820
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,209
<font color="yellow">Welcome. We've been waiting for you.</font>

821
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:34,009
<font color="yellow">- We're here. - Good to see you.</font>

822
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,439
<font color="yellow">It must've been a big decision for you. Thank you.</font>

823
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:39,869
<font color="yellow">I'm going to thank you for this until the day I die.</font>

824
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,809
<font color="yellow">Let's wait and see because you might end up regretting it.</font>

825
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:45,939
<font color="yellow">I mean, who buys suits at tailor shops these days?</font>

826
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,239
<font color="yellow">You're so good at discouraging people.</font>

827
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:50,709
<font color="yellow">Today is our first day here. Let's not cause trouble.</font>

828
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:51,869
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll keep my mouth shut.</font>

829
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:53,469
<font color="yellow">Ms Na. You're here, too.</font>

830
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:55,509
<font color="yellow">You must be tired from the long drive.</font>

831
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:56,639
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

832
00:55:58,169 --> 00:56:00,939
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's be friends from now on.</font>

833
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,339
<font color="yellow">We're neighbours now, so let's try to get along.</font>

834
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,139
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Jun?</font>

835
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,309
<font color="yellow">I suddenly got muscle spasm in my hand.</font>

836
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:11,969
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no. - I'm okay, Dong Sook.</font>

837
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:15,909
<font color="yellow">Bring your stuff in. Let's have dinner after.</font>

838
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:17,109
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Sure.</font>

839
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,569
<font color="yellow">If each of you can take one thing,</font>

840
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:21,739
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - it'll help us out a lot.</font>

841
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,609
<font color="yellow">- Give me something to carry. - No, Ms Choi. Please go in.</font>

842
00:56:23,709 --> 00:56:25,769
<font color="yellow">- Please don't worry. - It's fine.</font>

843
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:27,369
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

844
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:28,909
<font color="yellow">- you can take this. - All right.</font>

845
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:31,809
<font color="yellow">I'll take that one. Sam Do, give me that one.</font>

846
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,109
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

847
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:35,939
<font color="yellow">- I'll take something heavy. - You won't be able to carry it.</font>

848
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:38,039
<font color="yellow">- I'll be fine. - Be careful, okay?</font>

849
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:40,209
<font color="yellow">You got the heavy one!</font>

850
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:46,639
<font color="yellow">- Hey, you. - Ouch.</font>

851
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,539
<font color="yellow">- What do you want? - Everyone is helping us out.</font>

852
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:54,209
<font color="yellow">How can you go in empty-handedly?</font>

853
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:56,169
<font color="yellow">Goodness! This can break my arms.</font>

854
00:56:56,169 --> 00:56:59,439
<font color="yellow">- This is so heavy! - You have to carry it.</font>

855
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,539
<font color="yellow">I mean, aren't you going to be using our kitchen tools?</font>

856
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:03,239
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and take it to the kitchen.</font>

857
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:05,409
<font color="yellow">You have to come back and help us carry our refrigerator.</font>

858
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:06,969
<font color="yellow">Your refrigerator?</font>

859
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:10,809
<font color="yellow">You don't have to help us if you aren't going to use it.</font>

860
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:14,909
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

861
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:19,169
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

862
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,339
<font color="yellow">With people like him, you need to show them who's in charge.</font>

863
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,909
<font color="yellow">You're absolutely right.</font>

864
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:52,169
<font color="yellow">These are about to start sprouting.</font>

865
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,939
<font color="yellow">Mum worked so hard to grow these.</font>

866
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:58,569
<font color="yellow">Sweet potatoes and black beans?</font>

867
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:01,709
<font color="yellow">Then bring them to Mr Lee's place.</font>

868
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:05,009
<font color="yellow">I live alone, but this house is filled with people.</font>

869
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,609
<font color="yellow">Yes. Okay, call me when you're here.</font>

870
00:58:09,669 --> 00:58:10,839
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

871
00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:15,569
<font color="yellow">It was Tae Yang. His mum sent him sweet potatoes and black beans,</font>

872
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:17,109
<font color="yellow">so I told him to bring them here.</font>

873
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:20,369
<font color="yellow">Are they almost done with moving their stuff in?</font>

874
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:23,909
<font color="yellow">You know how frugal Sun Nyeo is. They don't have much stuff.</font>

875
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:25,609
<font color="yellow">Is dinner almost ready?</font>

876
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,069
<font color="yellow">Yes. We just need to heat up the soup.</font>

877
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:29,909
<font color="yellow">- Try calling Dong Jin. - Why?</font>

878
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:33,469
<font color="yellow">He hasn't called since leaving for the countryside for work.</font>

879
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:36,969
<font color="yellow">I've been having nightmares, so I'm worried about him.</font>

880
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:44,769
<font color="yellow">He's not answering.</font>

881
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:47,139
<font color="yellow">Is something going on at work?</font>

882
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:56,509
<font color="yellow">Close the store.</font>

883
00:58:56,939 --> 00:58:59,909
<font color="yellow">- Sell it. - What?</font>

884
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:02,409
<font color="yellow">Don't cling on to something that's losing money.</font>

885
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,369
<font color="yellow">Take Mum travelling. Eat nice food and have fun.</font>

886
00:59:06,569 --> 00:59:09,939
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 20 times what you make in that store.</font>

887
00:59:10,669 --> 00:59:13,069
<font color="yellow">I wasn't able to tell you this,</font>

888
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:16,009
<font color="yellow">but to tell you the truth...</font>

889
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:17,539
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

890
00:59:20,169 --> 00:59:21,339
<font color="yellow">He came to my office...</font>

891
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:25,039
<font color="yellow">to tell me about it.</font>

892
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:28,709
<font color="yellow">I had no idea and just got all mad at him.</font>

893
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,809
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

894
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:47,739
<font color="yellow">Ever since my husband left home,</font>

895
00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:50,439
<font color="yellow">I've been feeling so lonely as if I'm living in an empty house.</font>

896
00:59:50,609 --> 00:59:53,739
<font color="yellow">With you two moving in, the house feels a lot more lively,</font>

897
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:55,469
<font color="yellow">and I feel so much better already.</font>

898
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:57,039
<font color="yellow">Mum, please.</font>

899
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,609
<font color="yellow">- You have Jun, too. - What?</font>

900
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,109
<font color="yellow">Right, sure.</font>

901
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,239
<font color="yellow">Jun does live here, too.</font>

902
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,439
<font color="yellow">Yun Shil!</font>

903
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:07,669
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

904
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:11,809
