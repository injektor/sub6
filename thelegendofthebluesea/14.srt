31
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,720

<font color="yellow">That dream could be an unfulfilled love,</font>

63
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,920

64
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,600

<font color="yellow">- All of them?<br>- Yes, all of them.</font>

67
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,650
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae, then should we enjoy some empty formalities and vanity?</font>

68
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,800
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

69
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,740
<font color="yellow">Actually, there are three levels of love: Romantic Love, Hot Love, and Dirty Love.</font>

70
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,930
<font color="yellow">What we are trying to do is romantic love.</font>

71
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,810
<font color="yellow">What's romantic love?</font>

72
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,170
<font color="yellow">Well, it's like vain formalities.</font>

73
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,490
<font color="yellow">Drink tea, watch movies, have meals together, plan a special event, confess love, things like that.</font>

74
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,250
<font color="yellow">But all these are moving towards dirty love.</font>

75
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,190
<font color="yellow">- Dirty?<br>- Yes, dirty love.</font>

76
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,830
<font color="yellow">I am also very curious about it, but I was told that is reserved only for the experts.</font>

77
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,200
<font color="yellow">She said that if we carelessly approach it, it could end in a nasty way. So, we have to be careful.</font>

78
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,570
<font color="yellow">So, we should enjoy vain formalities first.</font>

79
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,840
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's do that.</font>

110
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,890
<font color="yellow">I'd follow you.</font>

111
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,620
<font color="yellow">Hey! What do you mean you'd follow me?! Are you crazy?!</font>

112
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,740
<font color="yellow">And you need to give it some thought before you respond.</font>

113
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,880
<font color="yellow">You told me to answer right away without thinking.</font>

114
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,330
<font color="yellow">But still, who answers</font>

115
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,250
<font color="yellow">as if they were being asked to go to the grocery store?</font>

116

<font color="yellow">If you live, I have to live with you and if you die, I have to die with you.</font>

117
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,110
<font color="yellow">Are you stupid?</font>

118
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,620
<font color="yellow">Then what becomes of the man's death? The man died to save the woman.</font>

119
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,040
<font color="yellow">The man says that at the end, "Please listen to my request."</font>

120
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,240
<font color="yellow">"Promise that you'll live on and that you won't give up."</font>

122
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,930
<font color="yellow">Would you do that?</font>

123
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,530
<font color="yellow">If I'm not in this world, would you meet another good person and grow old happily?</font>

124
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,130
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

125
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,870
<font color="yellow">Of course, I would do that.</font>

126

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,720
<font color="yellow">Is something really going to happen to you?</font>

136
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,820
<font color="yellow">I told you it was just "if."</font>

137
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,060
<font color="yellow">Promise me.</font>

138
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,480
<font color="yellow">If anything happens, you won't think any weird thoughts.</font>

139
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,320
<font color="yellow">Until the end,</font>

140
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,550
<font color="yellow">you'll live well.</font>

141
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,790
<font color="yellow">- I can't. <br>-Why?</font>

142
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,480
<font color="yellow">It feels like if I make the promise, something bad like that will happen.</font>

143
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,240
<font color="yellow">So I said "if."</font>

144
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,230
<font color="yellow">What if or what not, I don't like it!</font>

145
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,920
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

146
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,840
<font color="yellow">- You're not going to promise me?<br>- No.</font>

147
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,890
<font color="yellow">- You really won't?<br>- I'm not going to!</font>

148
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,930
<font color="yellow">You're not going to hold my hand now?</font>

149
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,950
<font color="yellow">You're not going to talk to me?</font>

150
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,020
<font color="yellow">- Promise me. <br>-Are you talking about that again?</font>

151
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,510
<font color="yellow">I told you I wouldn't. Why do I need to make that kind of promise?</font>

152
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,250
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me. I won't talk to you either.</font>

153
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,790
<font color="yellow">Tae Oh, see me for a second.</font>

154
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,280
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the atmosphere between you two? Did you fight?</font>

155
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,150
<font color="yellow">- He keeps saying weird stuff!<br>- What weird stuff?</font>

156
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,990
<font color="yellow">Like saying that if something happens to him, to live on well on my own.</font>

157
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,520
<font color="yellow">- Huh?<br>-It's weird, isn't it?</font>

158
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,890
<font color="yellow">- Why?<br>-It's come.</font>

159
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,250
<font color="yellow">- What has come?<br>- He grew tired of it.</font>

160
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,910
<font color="yellow">The valid period of love is 3 months. It's been 3 months for you guys.</font>

161
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,850
<font color="yellow">You need to overcome this well or it's a KTX <i>(express train)</i> headed towards your breakup.</font>

162
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,530
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae is not that kind of person.</font>

163
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,860
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae is especially that kind of person. I've known him for 10 years, and he hasn't had a girlfriend for more than 3 months.</font>

164
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,480
<font color="yellow">They all break up before then.</font>

165
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,530
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

166
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,030
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

167
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,890
<font color="yellow">Adjust the home security to the maximum setting.</font>

168
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,020
<font color="yellow">Connect a line so I can monitor any space within 100m at any time.</font>

169
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,810
<font color="yellow">When it detects any break-ins from outside, make it alert me right away.</font>

170
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,020
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Ma Dae Young?</font>

171
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,510
<font color="yellow">Hello, doctor.</font>

172
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,390
<font color="yellow">Ma Dae Young?</font>

173
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,380
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

174
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,560
<font color="yellow">It's been 9 months, Doctor.</font>

175
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,540
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae came here, didn't he?</font>

176
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,090
<font color="yellow">Don't think about lying because I saw it all.</font>

177
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,560
<font color="yellow">Let me do what Heo Joon Jae did.</font>

178
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,760
<font color="yellow">It seems like he saw his end, and I want to see mine too.</font>

179
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,790
<font color="yellow">My end.</font>

180
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,310
<font color="yellow">I think I need to know that.</font>

181
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,990
<font color="yellow">So I can know why my life is the way it is.</font>

182
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,390
<font color="yellow">From the moment I was born,</font>

183
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,620
<font color="yellow">I always thought that I was being punished.</font>

184
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,270
<font color="yellow">Why my life is like this,</font>

185
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,910
<font color="yellow">I've wanted to ask.</font>

186
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know why,</font>

187
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,530
<font color="yellow">but I think the answer lies in that life.</font>

188
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,260
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

189
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,040
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

190
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,880
<font color="yellow">Then who was it?</font>

191
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,150
<font color="yellow">Who killed them?</font>

192
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,420
<font color="yellow">You probably heard it already. Going forward, I will be the final approving authority.</font>

193
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,450
<font color="yellow">I will personally lead the investors' meetings as well.</font>

194
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,310
<font color="yellow">Is Chairman Heo very ill?</font>

195
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,090
<font color="yellow">There are outsiders asking.</font>

196
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,440
<font color="yellow">No, he has gone on a trip to relax and recuperate.</font>

197
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,850
<font color="yellow">Even after he returns, he wants to step back from the workforce.</font>

198
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,600
<font color="yellow">If you have anything to tell him, you can tell me.</font>

199
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,500
<font color="yellow">But there are still things that need to be reported directly to him.</font>

200
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,710
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

201
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,090
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid that I'll take out or add in the middle? Can you not trust me?</font>

202
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,030
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

203
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,640
<font color="yellow">If you are on my father's side and cannot work under me,</font>

204
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,000
<font color="yellow">you can leave now.</font>

205
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,410
<font color="yellow">I'll take that as no one.</font>

206
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,020
<font color="yellow">Can we start the meeting?</font>

207
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,520
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

208
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,790
<font color="yellow">I met with the doctor, and he said the results are good.</font>

209
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,230
<font color="yellow">Stay here for a few more days and then return home and receive regular outpatient treatment.</font>

210
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,690
<font color="yellow">My eyes are worsening as time passes.</font>

211
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,260
<font color="yellow">It's a big problem.</font>

212
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, but because you just had surgery for a hemorrhage,</font>

213
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,960
<font color="yellow">it's difficult to perform surgery for your eyes.</font>

214
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,490
<font color="yellow">- For now, take your medication and just be careful not to worsen the condition.<br>- Okay.</font>

215
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,780
<font color="yellow">Chi Hyeon,</font>

216
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

217
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,020
<font color="yellow">You can contact Joon Jae, right?</font>

218
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,550
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

219
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,300
<font color="yellow">Ah, as soon as you fell, I contacted him.</font>

220
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,000
<font color="yellow">- You did?<br>- Yes.</font>

221
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,200
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's busy.</font>

222
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll come by soon.</font>

223
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,610
<font color="yellow">I'll contact him again.</font>

224
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

225
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Petty guy!</i></font>

226
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Narrow minded one! He is pouting over that thing and wouldn't talk to me?</i></font>

227
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,280
<font color="yellow"><i>I must've been blinded by love. I was naive then.</i></font>

228
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,160
<font color="yellow"><i>I lived in water all my life, and came to the land for the first time. So, what do I know?</i></font>

229
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,170
<font color="yellow"><i>The only guy that I happened to meet was that Heo Joon Jae. So I thought he was the best.</i></font>

230
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,390
<font color="yellow"><i>If Seoul was far, he should have told me that.</i></font>

231
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,880
<font color="yellow"><i>He flew in the plane. But, it took me 3 months and 10 days, just because of him,</i></font>

232
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,870
<font color="yellow"><i>and I swam all the way here that I thought my coccyx was about to fall off!</i></font>

233
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,570
<font color="yellow"><i>Why is he asking me to make that kind of nonsensical promise?</i></font>

234
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,410
<font color="yellow">Stop it already!</font>

235
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,140
<font color="yellow">Huh? What?</font>

236
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,060
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop it. You are cussing me out inside right now.</font>

237
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,450
<font color="yellow"><i>Heol! How did he know?</i></font>

238
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,890
<font color="yellow"><i>He sure has a keen sense of what's going on.</i></font>

239
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought Heo Joon Jae was the only good looking guy in the world, but there are plethora of them on TV.</i></font>

240
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,060
<font color="yellow"><i>Does he think he is the only one who is handsome? He has the Prince-Syndrome and thinks everyone is attracted to him!</i></font>

241
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,170
<font color="yellow">- Hey!<br> - What?! <br>- Ah, jeez!</font>

242
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,900
<font color="yellow">Stop it already. If it's not meant to be, just break up.</font>

243
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,270
<font color="yellow">Don't go out anywhere and just stay home.</font>

244
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,690
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. I have an appointment.</font>

245
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,640
<font color="yellow">Whom are you meeting?</font>

246
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,100
<font color="yellow">Whom are <i>you</i> meeting?</font>

247
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,500
<font color="yellow">See? You can't even tell me.</font>

248
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,580
<font color="yellow">That's right. It has to be fair.</font>

249
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,360
<font color="yellow">Then, you go with her, Hyung.</font>

250
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,290
<font color="yellow">Why should I follow her?</font>

251
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,710
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. It's my appointment. I don't need anyone.</font>

252
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,520
<font color="yellow">Fine! Do whatever you want.</font>

253
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,460
<font color="yellow">Good job, Cheong! He was hanging out with a "Me-mi" and he is about to become one.</font>

254
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,430
<font color="yellow">What's "Mi-mi"?</font>

255
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,680
<font color="yellow">Crazy Misery! Those who are into things like obsessiveness, and confinement.</font>

256
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,670
<font color="yellow">But I don't mind things like obsessiveness and confinement.</font>

257
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,910
<font color="yellow">Well, I sort of like it.</font>

258
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,280
<font color="yellow">Because you are like this, he is getting tired of it.</font>

259
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,730
<font color="yellow">Harden your heart and go strong!</font>

260
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,370
<font color="yellow">Ahjussi, I'm sorry for not coming to visit you often.</font>

261
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,890
<font color="yellow">I have a lot going on these days.</font>

262
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,910
<font color="yellow">Can I tell you a story that no one could believe?</font>

263
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:57,490
<font color="yellow">A very long time ago, you were a good friend of mine, and was always on my side.</font>

264
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,510
<font color="yellow">This time, you were born a bit earlier and stood by me even when I was young.</font>

265
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,710
<font color="yellow">Now, whoever made you like this...</font>

266
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,820
<font color="yellow">I will find them.</font>

267
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,100
<font color="yellow">If it's this person, blink twice.</font>

268
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,430
<font color="yellow">Do you think there is someone who is related to Ma Dae Young around you?</font>

269
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,280
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae.</font>

270
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,520
<font color="yellow">I was really drunk last time. You must have been startled after receiving the call.</font>

271
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,040
<font color="yellow">Saying that you will protect your mother, so protect my father, was also something you said because you were drunk?</font>

272
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, did I say that? I must have been really drunk.</font>

273
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,760
<font color="yellow">What about father's health being bad?</font>

274
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, he is better now.</font>

275
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:22,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, our father gave all the work to me and went on a trip with his friends.</font>

276
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,220
<font color="yellow">Also, you will know this sooner or later...</font>

277
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,620
<font color="yellow">Father got his will notarized.</font>

278
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,010
<font color="yellow">He left almost all his assets to me and mother.</font>

279
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,320
<font color="yellow">I told him to reconsider several times.</font>

280
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,960
<font color="yellow">After meeting you the last time, he must have been heartbroken.</font>

281
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,870
<font color="yellow">Were you always such a friendly guy?</font>

282
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,400
<font color="yellow">I will hate my father on my own.</font>

283
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,830
<font color="yellow">You don't need to encourage me to hate him.</font>

284
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,130
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing this, it looks like you have some ulterior motive.</font>

285
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,240
<font color="yellow">What about Cheong?</font>

286
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,340
<font color="yellow">Is she well?</font>

287
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,760
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask that?</font>

288
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,140
<font color="yellow">That's right. I think of her time to time. I wonder if she is doing well.</font>

289
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,870
<font color="yellow">Send my greetings to her.</font>

290
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,780
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

291
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,120
<font color="yellow">Forget it, if you don't want to.</font>

292
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I don't know what to do!</font>

293

<font color="yellow">Ah. "Pour-eat, dip-eat." As for me, "dip-eat."</font>

514
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:59,610
<font color="yellow">I'm glad. I also prefer dip-eat, but since Heo Joon Jae is a "pour-eat," we always fight when we eat.</font>

518
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,340

00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,830
<font color="yellow">You guys fought again? Why do you fight everyday?</font>

531
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,610
<font color="yellow">I met Heo Joon Jae's older brother today, and that's why he's like that. Isn't that weird?</font>

532
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:30,470
<font color="yellow">If a guy gets mad at a girl who met his family, that means he has no intention of continuing the relationship with her.</font>

<font color="yellow">What? You met his older brother? How?</font>

534
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,100
<font color="yellow">He came to have a meal with me.</font>

535
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:41,480
<font color="yellow">I thought he wasn't keeping in touch with any of his family members. I've never been introduced to them, either.</font>

536
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,670
<font color="yellow">You've been introduced?</font>

537
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,580
<font color="yellow">Yes. The last, last, last time.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>What's wrong?</i></font>

539
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,860
<font color="yellow"><i>Is it because it's been so long since I've been in the water?</i></font>

540
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,770
<font color="yellow"><i>What should I do?</i></font>

541
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,960
<font color="yellow">So no one will ever be able to get through this, right?</font>

542
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,410
<font color="yellow">Unless if they get someone who is a better hacker than me, they won't be able to get into our house.</font>

543
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:46,470
<font color="yellow">Okay. That fine. Also, go out and stay out today.</font>

544
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,220
<font color="yellow">Why? I don't have any plans.</font>

545
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,950
<font color="yellow">Hyung, you get out, too. Don't come back until the evening.</font>

546
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,050
<font color="yellow">What should I do that?</font>

547
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,110
<font color="yellow">This is my house. When the house owner tells you to do so, you do it.</font>

548
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:04,780
<font color="yellow">Wow, he is making us pitiful again. Where could we go in this harsh winter weather?</font>

549
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:10,070
<font color="yellow">Since you said you are not going to work, it's so hard to even set up a meeting.</font>

550
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,930
<font color="yellow">Okay. Well, then, today,</font>

<font color="yellow">Hurry and come out. I'll wait out there.</font>

555
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:54,630
<font color="yellow">Until the evening, no one will come?</font>

556
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,450
<font color="yellow">Aish, it's so cold and where is he telling me to go?</font>

557
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,520
<font color="yellow">I was wondering what you were doing.</font>

558
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,760
<font color="yellow">Are you not cold? Why are you swimming during the winter?</font>

559
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:32,300
<font color="yellow">What...what are you wearing? What's on your body?</font>

560
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:40,440
<font color="yellow">Ah, you're going to do a part-time job agian...wearing that in an aquarium...Aigoo!</font>

563
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,770
<font color="yellow">I"m sorry. I'm sorry. I've been watching too much American drama.</font>

564
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,910
<font color="yellow">It really looks like the real thing. I'm thinking about something impossible...</font>

565

566
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,620

00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,910
<font color="yellow">Tell him? Uh, I'm not sure.</font>

582
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,940
<font color="yellow">After I see how you reply to my questions.</font>

583
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,910
<font color="yellow">Don't come close.</font>

584
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,700
<font color="yellow">So, when you go inside water, you turn into what you were before,</font>

585
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,560
<font color="yellow">and if you come out of the water, you grow legs?</font>

586
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,940
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

587
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,940
<font color="yellow">Wow! I'm going crazy!</font>

588
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:48,480
<font color="yellow">So, the pearl? The pearl from last time... like how in the fairy tales...it changed from your tears?</font>

589
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,120
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

590
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,850
<font color="yellow">Cry.</font>

591
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:01,560
<font color="yellow">Cry. Let me see if it really turns into pearls. It's because I'm fascinated right now.</font>

592
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,210
<font color="yellow">Okay, well, you don't have to cry right now. Let's slowly cry a lot from now on.</font>

593
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,380
<font color="yellow">Wow! This is a jackpot!</font>

594
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,500
<font color="yellow">Since I replied well, you're not going to tell Heo Joon Jae, right?</font>

595
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:23,120
<font color="yellow">Cheong! Mermaid Cheong! Why should we keep this a secret?</font>

596
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,700
<font color="yellow">This is an amazing thing! We are sitting on a pile of money!</font>

597
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,250
<font color="yellow">I don't like a pile of money!</font>

598
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,670
<font color="yellow">I like it! What's the point of staying home?</font>

599
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:35,540
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let's go to a place like Las Vegas together,</font>

600
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:40,370
<font color="yellow">launch a mermaid show, and go a world tour!</font>

601
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,510
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you're going to sell me off, Jo Nam Doo?</font>

602
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,740
<font color="yellow">No! I'm recommending you a job. It's hard for a normal person to get a job these days.</font>

603
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,360
<font color="yellow">Since it's me, I am not reporting you to the government agency,</font>

604
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,260
<font color="yellow">and am going to look into going overseas for work.</font>

605
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,800
<font color="yellow">-Okay!<br>-Okay?</font>

606
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,260
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

607
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,860
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

608
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,030
<font color="yellow">-You want to handshake?<br>Yeah, let's handshake.</font>

609
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,550
<font color="yellow">It's not something contagious, right?</font>

610
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,840
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

611
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,050
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Doo, are you okay?</font>

612
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,110
<font color="yellow">Were you swimming here?</font>

613
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:49,840
<font color="yellow">Is it not cold in this winter?</font>

614
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:03,490
<font color="yellow"><i>If Heo Joon Jae also sees my real self, would he act like Jo Nam Doo?</i></font>

615
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:07,630
<font color="yellow"><i>Since I was already caught, should I have asked him first before erasing his memories?</i></font>

616
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,930
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Doo!</font>

617
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,650
<font color="yellow">Are you not cold? Why are you swimming during the winter?</font>

618
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,150
<font color="yellow">What are you wearing?</font>

619
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,380
<font color="yellow">Wanting to get a part-time? I... you... a mermaid!</font>

620
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,730
<font color="yellow">Can I touch it?</font>

621
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,500
<font color="yellow">Wow, I'm going crazy!</font>

622
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,750
<font color="yellow">This is amazing!</font>

623
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,940
<font color="yellow">Try crying. We are now sitting on a pile of money!</font>

624
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:33,730
<font color="yellow">You know all of the truth, so you probably can't see me the same way as before, right?</font>

625
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,140
<font color="yellow">Of course not! To be honest, it's hard to see you in the same way as before.</font>

626
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,600
<font color="yellow">Would Heo Joon Jae also be like this?</font>

627
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:44,070
<font color="yellow">He will be worse than me! If he sees something like this, he will run away 100%!</font>

628
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,190
<font color="yellow">Then I probably should never be caught.</font>

629
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,480
<font color="yellow">But it's too late, because I found out.</font>

630
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,510
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was questioning whether or not it would work since I've only done it once in the water.</font>

631
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,750
<font color="yellow">But it works well outside of the water too.</font>

632
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,330
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

633
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

634
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy.</font>

635
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,300
<font color="yellow">You know that feeling. When you're about to think of something, but it doesn't come out.</font>

636
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,610
<font color="yellow"><i>What should I do? Does he remember?</i></font>

637
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:42,760
<font color="yellow">Something like seeing the lottery number in your dreams and then not remembering it.</font>

638
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,890
<font color="yellow">That frustration that makes you go crazy!</font>

639
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,940
<font color="yellow"><i>I erased it, but did it not erase well?</i></font>

640
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,330
<font color="yellow">Wait! I think I remember something.</font>

641
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:01,120
<font color="yellow">That... in this house's swimming pool...</font>

642
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,770
<font color="yellow">Cheong...!</font>

643
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,930
<font color="yellow">Ow, why did you hit me?</font>

644
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,100
<font color="yellow">Eat instead of being loud.</font>

645
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,460
<font color="yellow">Hey, look! Look at my toes.</font>

646
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,910
<font color="yellow">I feel like my toenail is going to fall off! But I don't remember!</font>

647
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:24,830
<font color="yellow">How my foot became like this! How my foot has bumped into something!</font>

648
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,500
<font color="yellow">I just can't remember anything!</font>

649
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,480
<font color="yellow">It's early dementia due to alcohol.</font>

650
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,110
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

651
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,590
<font color="yellow">So watch your drinking!</font>

652
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,520
<font color="yellow">Ah, put it down.</font>

653
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,460
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to live, spearing poop on the wall.</font>

654
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,420
<font color="yellow">How can i be like this already?</font>

655
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,010
<font color="yellow">There supposed to be three bad luck this year. Has it started already?</font>

656
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:00,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Subtitles brought to you by The Blue Sea @ Viki</i></font>

657
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,050
<font color="yellow">Until when are you going to be like this?</font>

658
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,820
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

659
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:09,280
<font color="yellow">You're not talking to me or meeting my eyes or smiling.</font>

660
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:14,650
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Let me ask one more time. If something happens to me...</font>

661
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,800
<font color="yellow">It's the same even if you ask a hundred times.</font>

662
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,670
<font color="yellow">If something happens to you, I can't live.</font>

663
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,360
<font color="yellow">Yeah, so why?</font>

664
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,060
<font color="yellow">That...</font>

665
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:30,260
<font color="yellow"><i>My heart can only beat if you love me.</i></font>

674
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,990
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

675
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,380
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

676
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,940
<font color="yellow">What...?</font>

677
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:24,140
<font color="yellow">Say it again. What will stop, harden... What will happen?</font>

00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,880
