00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,360
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Joon Jae? What did you see? Do you remember?</font>

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,350
<font color="yellow">Professor Park.</font>

143
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, Joon Jae. Tell me everything you saw.</font>

144
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,910
<font color="yellow">Professor told me before</font>

145
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,150
<font color="yellow">that hypnosis can bring out my subconsciousness</font>

146
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,380
<font color="yellow">but could also possible bring out the illusion.</font>

147
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,520
<font color="yellow">I said so.</font>

148
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,610
<font color="yellow">I think that's what I see, the illusion.</font>

149
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,150
<font color="yellow">Otherwise,</font>

150
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,450
<font color="yellow">this doesn't make sense.</font>

151
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,480
<font color="yellow">Whoa, you're the best player in the whole country?</font>

152
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,450
<font color="yellow">Not just within your guild, but in the whole country?</font>

153
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,310
<font color="yellow">Heo Joon Jae!</font>

154
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,490
<font color="yellow">- Are you going somewhere?<br>- Yes, I...</font>

155
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,490
<font color="yellow">Never mind. I don't need to know. Please go ahead.</font>

156
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,680
<font color="yellow">Alright.</font>

157
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,040
<font color="yellow">But... From today, we have a curfew.</font>

158
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,100
<font color="yellow">- We do? <br>- Yes, starting today.</font>

159
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,540
<font color="yellow">What time?</font>

160
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,910
<font color="yellow">8 PM. Come by back 8, or else we'll lock the door and won't let you back in.</font>

161
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's 7:30.</font>

162
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,180
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean. She needs to come back by 8.</font>

163
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,680
<font color="yellow">Where in Seoul would she go if she needs to come back in 30 mins? You might as well tell her not to go.</font>

164
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,950
<font color="yellow">Who's telling her not to go?</font>

165
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,050
<font color="yellow">Go. I don't know</font>

166
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,290
<font color="yellow">whom she's meeting up with. Whoever that guy...</font>

167
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,740
<font color="yellow">Wait, I don't even know if she's meeting a guy or a girl.</font>

168
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,310
<font color="yellow">Anyway, after she meets whomever that unknown person may be,</font>

169
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,410
<font color="yellow">she needs to come back by 8.</font>

170
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,240
<font color="yellow">If she doesn't like it, she can simply stay away from here permanently.</font>

171
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,940
<font color="yellow">Whose book is this? The 7th Grade Civil Servant?</font>

172
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,280
<font color="yellow">- Are you trying to become a civil servant?<br>- Are you in your right mind?</font>

173
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,590
<font color="yellow">I was just reading in thinking it might help with our work.</font>

174
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,980
<font color="yellow">What kinds of study people do these days.</font>

175
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,980
<font color="yellow">I was curious. As a matter of analyzing a trend.</font>

176
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,320
<font color="yellow">Are you going out?</font>

177
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,720
<font color="yellow">No, I won't. I'll just go out tomorrow.</font>

178
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,920
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

179
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,510
<font color="yellow">He's strange, really.</font>

180
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,960
<font color="yellow">Where were you going to at this hour, my Cheong?</font>

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,410
<font color="yellow">- I was going out to make money.<br>Making money? You mean doing a part-time work?</font>

182
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:10,330
<font color="yellow">No, I was going to exchange these to money. I was going to give all the money to Heo Joon Jae.</font>

183
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,980
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

184
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, these...</font>

185
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,890
<font color="yellow">Where did you get them?</font>

186
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,460
<font color="yellow">I got them by working hard.</font>

187
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,450
<font color="yellow">What kind of work do you need to do get these high-quality pearls?</font>

188
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,550
<font color="yellow">You've become even more mysterious. You need to appear on an investigation program, <i>"Tell Me the Truth"</i></font>

189
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,850
<font color="yellow">- Could I give me one of these?<br>- No.</font>

190
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,440
<font color="yellow">I get it, I get it. I'll just look.</font>

191
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,120
<font color="yellow">Whoa, these are of really high quality.</font>

192
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I have finished cooking yummy white rice.</i></font>

193
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,260
<font color="yellow">Are you sure? Have you fished it for sure?</font>

194
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,270
<font color="yellow">Good job, really.</font>

195
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,740
<font color="yellow">Rice Cheong, Rice Cheong!</font>

196
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,620
<font color="yellow">She's not Sim Cheong, but Rice Cheong!</font>

197
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,970
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt?</font>

198
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,860
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I work as a life guard in this cold weather?</font>

199
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,260
<font color="yellow">You don't have a place to sleep?</font>

200
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,660
<font color="yellow">Hey, I rent a 30 Pyeong (100 sqm /1000 sqft) apartment near Omokgyo subway station. I make a decent living.</font>

201
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,970
<font color="yellow">I also have a king-sized bed, a big one.</font>

202
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,030
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I'm here after all?</font>

203
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,190
<font color="yellow">My heart has almost reached its limit.</font>

204
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,190
<font color="yellow">I have to be in the water for a few hours a day to survive the day.</font>

205
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,340
<font color="yellow">Of course I don't even know when it will stop working.</font>

206
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,410
<font color="yellow">- What do you do then? Do you have any other way?<br>- There is.</font>

207
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,030
<font color="yellow">My love to come back to me, but it won't work.</font>

208
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,300
<font color="yellow">She's married to another guy.</font>

209
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,860
<font color="yellow">Then quickly go back to the sea. What are you doing here?</font>

210
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,580
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking? What are you doing here?</font>

211
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,770
<font color="yellow">If you had to erase his memory as you were caught while saving him,</font>

212
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,450
<font color="yellow">then you should just consider that a good memory and go back to the sea where you live.</font>

213
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,110
<font color="yellow">Who appreciates you for keeping the forgotten promise?</font>

214
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,890
<font color="yellow">Why did you come all the way here. For what?</font>

215
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:59,790
<font color="yellow">To endure all the suspicion and mistreatment to the extent of abuse? And wonder when he'll love you?</font>

216
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,280
<font color="yellow">You go back when you still have a chance.</font>

217
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,120
<font color="yellow">It's not too late for you.</font>

218
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,280
<font color="yellow">How would I live when I go back? I will miss him.</font>

219
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,790
<font color="yellow">That's why</font>

220
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,130
<font color="yellow">I'm slowing dying here, too.</font>

221
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:26,000
<font color="yellow">Even if I go back, my life is pretty much done.</font>

222
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,560
<font color="yellow">If I die here, or go back to live the lifeless life.</font>

223
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,210
<font color="yellow">I know too well that it's all the same.</font>

224

228
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,460
<font color="yellow">I want to reborn as a human in my next life</font>

<font color="yellow">How long would my heart last?</font>

232
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,670
<font color="yellow">I am not sure. It's been 2 months since my love left her.</font>

233
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,010
<font color="yellow">You can probably guess from my case to see how long I last.</font>

238
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,090
<font color="yellow">He'll come back.</font>

239
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,150

240
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,560

<font color="yellow">You couldn't hear? I answered it really plainly just now.</font>

285
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,410
<font color="yellow">I'll give you some time.</font>

286
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,020
<font color="yellow">Aigoo, if you give me some time, should I accept it?</font>

287
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,640
<font color="yellow">You know, for a person to like another person, is it such an easy thing to do in just a few days?</font>

288
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,610
<font color="yellow">That's the most difficult thing in the world.</font>

289
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,780
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

290
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,880
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

291
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,700
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

292
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,890
<font color="yellow">The easist thing in the world is</font>

293
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,860
<font color="yellow">to be disappointed by another person.</font>

294
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,870
<font color="yellow">Even after liking someone after his/her outer appearance,</font>

295
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,360
<font color="yellow">one will quickly be disappointed. That's how human beings are.</font>

296
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,100
<font color="yellow">There is no one who overcomes disappointment. So,</font>

297
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,120
<font color="yellow">loving another person is the most difficult thing.</font>

298
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,810
<font color="yellow">It's not.</font>

299
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,040
<font color="yellow">What's not?</font>

300
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,920
<font color="yellow">For me, loving someone is the easiest thing to do.</font>

301
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,480
<font color="yellow">Even when I tried so hard not to,</font>

302
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,090
<font color="yellow">I couldn't help but to love.</font>

303
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,250
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I wanted to be disappointed, I couldn't.</font>

304
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,140
<font color="yellow">For me, love overcomes everything.</font>

305
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,330
<font color="yellow">If you have plans to like me in the future, please let me know, Heo Joon Jae.</font>

306
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,810
<font color="yellow">Yes, mother-in-law.</font>

307
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,210
<font color="yellow">I was at Apgujeong Shopping Mall Culture Center,</font>

308
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,360
<font color="yellow">and made a cutting board.</font>

309
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,270
<font color="yellow">It's made with the highest quality wood that came from the Amazon's rain forest.</font>

310
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,490
<font color="yellow">I think it will live up to your kitchen level.</font>

311
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:48,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will definitely bring it on the weekend. Yes.</font>

312
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,430
<font color="yellow">Mother, have a good night. Yes.</font>

313
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,270
<font color="yellow">Unni, you are really amazing. It's hard even for me to please my mom, and you are just doing everything to satisfy her.</font>

314
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,480
<font color="yellow">Should I...</font>

315
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,010
<font color="yellow">give you a tip, sister-in-law? The way to control a man's heart.</font>

316
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:16,010
<font color="yellow">A guy can't do anything to a woman</font>

317
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,730
<font color="yellow">who is good to his mom.</font>

318
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,390
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

319
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:27,760
<font color="yellow">Take a look at your brother. After playing around so hard, he ended up marrying me, who treats his mom the best.</font>

320
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,100
<font color="yellow">So, the man that you are delivering food to...</font>

321
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,600
<font color="yellow">If you want to capture that man, then you should capture his mom. That's what I'm saying.</font>

322
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,680
<font color="yellow">But, then,</font>

323
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,690
<font color="yellow">he doesn't talk about his family too much. He's never said anything about his mom, either.</font>

324
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:57,760
<font color="yellow">Where does he leave? If she lives in Gangnam, I can even find out which sauna she goes to.</font>

325
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,650
<font color="yellow">Should I ask him discreetly?</font>

326
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:04,340
<font color="yellow">Make him drunk and then work up to him to ask.</font>

327
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,290
<font color="yellow">This is not the coffee that I normally drink, is it?</font>

328
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,790
<font color="yellow">We are all out of it.</font>

329
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,890
<font color="yellow">I told you that I won't drink it unless if it's the fair trade product.</font>

330
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll buy some more of that.</font>

331
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,240
<font color="yellow">But, while it's good to be considerate towards coffee planters in a faraway country,</font>

332
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,390
<font color="yellow">I think having some manners towards a person who lives in the same house is just as important.</font>

333
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,390
<font color="yellow">Ajumoni, are you trying to teach me now?</font>

334
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:52,440
<font color="yellow">I wasn't not trying to teach, but if you learned something, I am glad.</font>

335
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,760
<font color="yellow">Unni, what's wrong with that ajumma?</font>

336
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,940
<font color="yellow">She's always like that.</font>

337
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,590
<font color="yellow">Just ignore her.</font>

338
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,370
<font color="yellow">Miss, "How will I find out that guy's mom and befriend her?"</font>

339
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,210
<font color="yellow">You need to figure that out. That's the key.</font>

340
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,550
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae's mom?</font>

341
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:19,360
<font color="yellow">You should know something, Oppa. Joon Jae never talks about his family.</font>

342
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,230
<font color="yellow">If I say things like this to you, he will be really upset.</font>

343
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,440
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be like this?</font>

344
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,910
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay. Then, tell me first.</font>

345
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,430
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- Joon Jae came to visit you at the Museum not too long ago, right?</font>

346
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,090
<font color="yellow">- Yes.<br>- Didn't he ask about something?</font>

347
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,910
<font color="yellow">He asked if we've found the wooden inscription panels. He said you told him about it.</font>

348
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,070
<font color="yellow">- And? What else?<br>- What else?</font>

349
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,500
<font color="yellow">I showed him this.</font>

350
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,050
<font color="yellow">Wow! What is this?</font>

351
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,680
<font color="yellow">Is this a mermaid or something? This is fascinating painting.</font>

352
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,800
<font color="yellow">- So the owner of this is also Dam Ryeong, right?<br>- Yes.</font>

353
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,380
<font color="yellow">Wow, what is this? There definitely is something to it.</font>

354
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,910
<font color="yellow">It can't be just a coincidence.</font>

355
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,230
<font color="yellow">Since I told you, tell me about Joon Jae's mom.</font>

356
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,010
<font color="yellow">I don't know much, either, other than they got separated when he was ten, and that he is still looking for her.</font>

357
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,940
<font color="yellow">They got separated?</font>

358
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,910
<font color="yellow">I don't know where she is hiding.</font>

359
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:28,060
<font color="yellow">She isn't leaving any trace, so we can't find her. I'm wondering if she had passed away.</font>

360
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:35,030
<font color="yellow">I want to find her for him. Where are you, mother? I am confident that I can treat her so well.</font>

361
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,430
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lawyer Lee. Can we meet up tonight? About the will.</font>

362
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,800
<font color="yellow">I want it notarized.</font>

363
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,050
<font color="yellow">Even if the beneficiary isn't there in person,</font>

364
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,400
<font color="yellow">we can do it as long as we have the resident ID, right?</font>

365
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's possible. I will see you later, Chairman.</font>

366
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:32,520
<font color="yellow">He wants to notarize his will tonight. It seems like he wants to officially notarize the paperwork</font>

367
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,300
<font color="yellow">to leave the majority of his assets to Heo Joon Jae.</font>

368
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,150
<font color="yellow">Why is he in such a hurry.</font>

369
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,870
<font color="yellow">Cha Si Ah. Let's have a talk.</font>

370
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,180
<font color="yellow">You two should go ahead and talk. I have somewhere to go, so.</font>

371
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,280
<font color="yellow">What about?</font>

372
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,380
<font color="yellow">I have something I am curious about.</font>

373
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,400
<font color="yellow">In this place, what should I do for a guy to like a girl?</font>

374
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,740
<font color="yellow">How would I know that?</font>

375
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,790
<font color="yellow">You know. You do.</font>

376
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,440
<font color="yellow">If you are in front of Heo Joon Jae, you flip your hair like this.</font>

377
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,780
<font color="yellow">When you drink water, your fingers go like this. I saw it all.</font>

378
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,000
<font color="yellow">Tell me what else should I do.</font>

379
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,870
<font color="yellow">What are you asking me now?</font>

380
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,580
<font color="yellow">If not, are you asking to fight it out today?</font>

381
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,340
<font color="yellow">I am just asking. I'm in a haste that's why.</font>

382
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,420
<font color="yellow">What's the haste about?</font>

383
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,720
<font color="yellow">I want Heo Joon Jae to like me back quickly. I have no time.</font>

384
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,600
<font color="yellow">Ah, is that so?</font>

385
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,660
<font color="yellow">Joon Jae is easy.</font>

386
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,590
<font color="yellow">Easy?</font>

387
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,930
<font color="yellow">Of course. Joon Jae is...</font>

388
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,740
<font color="yellow">He likes not to be able to see a person. I think that makes him long for that person.</font>

389
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,300
<font color="yellow">Like this, if you are always in front of him and hanging around him in one house then that would be counterproductive.</font>

390
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,910
<font color="yellow">In other words, he would get bored and sick of it.</font>

391
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,300
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

392
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,320
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm telling you.</font>

393
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,230
<font color="yellow">- Lies.<br>- What?</font>

394
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,840
<font color="yellow">When you speak, you don't look me in the eyes, you touch your ears and hair.</font>

395
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,740
<font color="yellow">I know it all, how all the people here lie the moment they open their mouth. I found out how to communicate with you, Cha Si Ah.</font>

396
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,310
<font color="yellow">I just need to do the opposite of what you just said, right?</font>

397
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,440
<font color="yellow">Cha Si Ah, you can now go.</font>

398
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,950
<font color="yellow">I will be lingering in front of Heo Joon Jae and stick right next to him.</font>

399
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:47,440
<font color="yellow">Wow, what kind of 100 year old white fox <i>(someone extremely sly)</i> is that?! While acting all naive and everything...</font>

400
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,480
<font color="yellow">So annoying.</font>

401
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,910
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

402
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,360
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Heo Joon Jae?</font>

403
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,300
<font color="yellow">To the library.</font>

404
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,620
<font color="yellow">What is a library?</font>

405
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,450
<font color="yellow">A place where you study.</font>

406
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,670
<font color="yellow">Ah, move!</font>

407
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,410
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you today? Always lingering around.</font>

408
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,260
<font color="yellow">Did you get a plan? A plan of liking me?</font>

409
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,600
<font color="yellow">Hey! What plan...</font>

410
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,570
<font color="yellow">could possible be formed in just a day?</font>

411
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,920
<font color="yellow">I see that you don't have it yet. Okay. I will give you more time. But let's go to the library together.</font>

412
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,930
<font color="yellow">So bothersome. Just stay home.</font>

413
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,660
<font color="yellow">This girl. What about Nam Do hyung?</font>

414
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,790
<font color="yellow">He went out earlier.</font>

415
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,940
<font color="yellow">Did he? He went out?</font>

416
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,780
<font color="yellow">Tae Oh, what about you? Are you not going out?</font>

417
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not. I will rest at home today.</font>

418
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,460
<font color="yellow">Ah, really? At home.</font>

419
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,680
<font color="yellow">Well, among us</font>

420
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,400
<font color="yellow">the one that should be going to the library is you.<br>- Is that so?</font>

421
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,920
<font color="yellow">No matter how I look at it, you still lack learning.</font>

422
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,280
<font color="yellow">Totally, I'm totally lacking.</font>

423
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,060
<font color="yellow">Oh, well. What else can we do then? Let's go together to the library together then.</font>

424
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,190
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

425
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,220
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

426
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:34,780

522
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:07,140

523
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:14,470
<font color="yellow">He had a sudden heart attack. When he was moved to the hospital, he was already dead.</font>

527
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,770
<font color="yellow">He died, you said?</font>

528
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

529
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:45,290

530
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:50,210
<font color="yellow">He left this in his drawer with your contact info.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>That's right.</i></font>

533
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,770
<font color="yellow"><i>But then, when you stay here there aren't that much things that happen</i></font>

534
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:21,610
<font color="yellow"><i>that would make you cry out of happiness. I only cried like that once.</i></font>

535
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,250
<font color="yellow">While he stayed here, he cried out of happiness</font>

536
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,260
<font color="yellow">happened only once.</font>

537
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,970
<font color="yellow">He said he was so happy that he cried because of you.</font>

538
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:41,980
<font color="yellow">All those happy times, he must have wanted to leave it here.</font>

539
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:59,380
<font color="yellow">I didn't know he had a friend he could tell these things to.</font>

540
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,720
<font color="yellow">He was filled with so many secrets with me.</font>

541
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,370
<font color="yellow">Did you leave him because you detested the secrets?</font>

542
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,280
<font color="yellow">Secrets are made because people are different.</font>

543
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,410
<font color="yellow">Because you would have to not get caught being different.</font>

544
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:18,410
<font color="yellow">That's why that secret... in the end gives each other wounds.</font>

545
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,350
<font color="yellow">The person who is hiding something and the person being hidden.</font>

546
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,710
<font color="yellow">They all get hurt.</font>

547
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,170
<font color="yellow">That's why, if they both are different</font>

548
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,480
<font color="yellow">in the end you can't go together.</font>

549
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,560
<font color="yellow">You can't go together if you are different?</font>

550
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,120
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you know that you would only be giving pain to the other.</font>

551
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:45,260
<font color="yellow">Would you be able to go together just for the reason that you love that person?</font>

552
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,540
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hoon told me he doesn't regret it.</font>

553
00:44:53,330 --> 00:45:00,390
<font color="yellow">Because it's a heart that beats for only one person, so even if it hardens and dies in the end...</font>

554
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,070
<font color="yellow">He said he would not regret coming here.</font>

555
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:11,890
<font color="yellow">When asked why he didn't erase the memories when his real self was caught,</font>

556
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,060
<font color="yellow">he said that there were so many good times to be able to erase those memories.</font>

557
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:26,270
<font color="yellow">He hoped that those memories would stay with the person that he loves and would give that person strength.</font>

558
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,890
<font color="yellow">I will be going now.</font>

570
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you there?</font>

571
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,050
<font color="yellow">Stay there and wait. I will be right there.</font>

572

<font color="yellow">Is it you?</font>

573
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,260
<font color="yellow">The one who followed me not long ago and pretended to be a cop in front of my house?</font>

574
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,060
<font color="yellow">Where is Ahjussi? Why do you have his cellphone?</font>

575
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,940
<font color="yellow">You have so many questions.</font>

576
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,200
<font color="yellow">Why do you suppose I have so many? It's because I want to get the answers quickly and leave quickly.</font>

577
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,820
<font color="yellow">Someone is waiting for me so I have to hurry and go.</font>

578
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,620
<font color="yellow">You can't go now.</font>

579
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,510
<font color="yellow"><i>The address here is Yeon Heung Dong 29-21. It's the building not yet sold.</i></font>

00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,570
<font color="yellow"><i>No, it just feels weird.</i></font>

582
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I call the police?</i></font>

583
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,970
<font color="yellow"><i>Go ahead, so that I could get caught at the same time.</i></font>

584
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, if it's that strange then don't go in.</i></font>

585
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,310
<font color="yellow"><i>Call some bullet taxis nearby. They would be faster than the police.</i></font>

586
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,920
<font color="yellow"><i>And don't forget to tell them to honk the horn loudly when they come.</i></font>

00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,830
<font color="yellow">Come out. You need to get your money.</font>

590
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,400
<font color="yellow">Ahjussi. Can you please go faster.</font>

591
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,190
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

592
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,730
<font color="yellow"><i>The cellphone is turned off...</i></font>

593
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,690

594
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,980
<font color="yellow">Please go faster. She's a bit sick and she's alone.</font>

595
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,450
<font color="yellow">Aren't you more hurt?</font>

596
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,680
<font color="yellow">Hurry and go.</font>

597
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,080

598
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Would you be able to go together?</i></font>

599
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,120
<font color="yellow">Can we really not be able to go together?</font>

600
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,180
<font color="yellow">Where did she go? The weather is cold too.</font>
