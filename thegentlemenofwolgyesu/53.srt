00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:10,216
<font color="yellow">The groom and the bride,</font>

4
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:12,446
<font color="yellow">please wash your hands in the basin.</font>

5
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:29,955
<font color="yellow">Are they going to wash their feet after they wash their hands?</font>

6
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:31,355
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

7
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,625
<font color="yellow">That's how they wash their hands.</font>

8
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,395
<font color="yellow">Bride, bow to the groom.</font>

9
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:10,825
<font color="yellow">Groom, bow to the bride.</font>

10
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:52,995
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

11
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,255
<font color="yellow">Why did she drink it all up?</font>

12
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:10,125
<font color="yellow">The bride must be just like her mum. She drinks very well.</font>

13
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,725
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

14
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:13,055
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

15
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:17,925
<font color="yellow">She drank the whole thing up.</font>

16
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,395
<font color="yellow">She's just like her mum.</font>

17
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,725
<font color="yellow">- Did you drink up? - I did.</font>

18
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,355
<font color="yellow">Are your hands cold?</font>

19
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:17,125
<font color="yellow">I feel warm now.</font>

20
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,125
<font color="yellow">The groom and the bride will...</font>

21
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:27,525
<font color="yellow">- march now. - Have a good life.</font>

22
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:28,555
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

23
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:32,895
<font color="yellow">- Live happily. - Be happy.</font>

24
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,355
<font color="yellow">Why are we throwing this?</font>

25
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,425
<font color="yellow">I have no idea. Just do it.</font>

26
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,955
<font color="yellow">The adzuki beans prevent bad luck...</font>

27
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,125
<font color="yellow">and the rice means that it'll bring them wealth.</font>

28
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,125
<font color="yellow">That's why the guests throw them to the bride and the groom.</font>

29
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,855
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it means well.</font>

30
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:47,925
<font color="yellow">Be happy!</font>

31
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,495
<font color="yellow">Always be happy just as you're now.</font>

32
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:52,895
<font color="yellow">How do you know such a thing? You're young.</font>

33
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,655
<font color="yellow">She's a KBS anchor who has both beauty and intelligence.</font>

34
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,125
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

35
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,325
<font color="yellow">You're a dull fellow.</font>

36
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,895
<font color="yellow">Honey, why don't we...</font>

37
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,825
<font color="yellow">have a wedding again after 10 years in a traditional way?</font>

38
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,125
<font color="yellow">No thanks. That would be troublesome.</font>

39
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:12,125
<font color="yellow">You lack romance.</font>

40
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:13,555
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

41
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,225
<font color="yellow">It's you who have menopause, not me.</font>

42
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,555
<font color="yellow">Let's all have a wedding again after 10 years.</font>

43
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:20,655
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

44
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,325
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to do it with me,</font>

45
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,055
<font color="yellow">- I'll do it with another woman. - What?</font>

46
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,765
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, you and your wife can join us for the wedding later.</font>

47
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:29,765
<font color="yellow">- Shall we? - All right.</font>

48
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,355
<font color="yellow">All right, let's do it.</font>

49
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,925
<font color="yellow">- The bride and the groom... - Will march.</font>

50
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:38,955
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry, honey.</font>

51
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,095
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

52
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,155
<font color="yellow">- Two. - Three!</font>

53
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:24,955
<font color="yellow">Is this the wedding car?</font>

54
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,695
<font color="yellow">Can they go to Busan in this car?</font>

55
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,655
<font color="yellow">It seems that it's not in a good condition.</font>

56
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,055
<font color="yellow">My friend said...</font>

57
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:34,625
<font color="yellow">that it doesn't have any problem even though it doesn't look nice.</font>

58
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,125
<font color="yellow">Still, it's unreliable. I'll lend you my car. Take my car.</font>

59
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,255
<font color="yellow">No, thank you. We're fine.</font>

60
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,495
<font color="yellow">Thank you all...</font>

61
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,995
<font color="yellow">for coming to the wedding.</font>

62
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:45,125
<font color="yellow">Of course, we should come to their wedding.</font>

63
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,095
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the wedding song.</font>

64
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:49,655
<font color="yellow">It was moving.</font>

65
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,525
<font color="yellow">It's not that I'm taking credit,</font>

66
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,325
<font color="yellow">but my husband is so popular nowadays.</font>

67
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,725
<font color="yellow">People want him to sing for their weddings, 60th and 80th birthdays.</font>

68
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:03,095
<font color="yellow">It was his present to sing the wedding song for nothing.</font>

69
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,725
<font color="yellow">She promotes her husband even today.</font>

70
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,155
<font color="yellow">She's his manager non stop.</font>

71
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,125
<font color="yellow">Be careful when you drive.</font>

72
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,555
<font color="yellow">- All right, Hyo Sang. - Call me right away...</font>

73
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:21,895
<font color="yellow">if something happens.</font>

74
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,895
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Mum.</font>

75
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,725
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to spend an unforgettable first night.</font>

76
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:32,695
<font color="yellow">An unforgettable first night? You fool.</font>

77
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:35,355
<font color="yellow">That's not something you should say in front of your mother-in-law.</font>

78
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:39,455
<font color="yellow">It's fine. That's part of her charm.</font>

79
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,625
<font color="yellow">You two should get going in order to beat traffic.</font>

80
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,895
<font color="yellow">- See you all when we get back. - See you all when we get back.</font>

81
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:53,195
<font color="yellow">Have a safe trip, Tae Yang.</font>

82
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:54,225
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

83
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,395
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead and leave now. - Let's get going.</font>

84
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:06,555
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang.</font>

85
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,195
<font color="yellow">We'll be going now, Mum.</font>

86
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,455
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

87
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,725
<font color="yellow">Drive safely.</font>

88
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,895
<font color="yellow">They're really going. Here they go.</font>

89
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:27,525
<font color="yellow">- How wonderful. - The honeymoon period is the best.</font>

90
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,825
<font color="yellow">Sam Do. Did you give Tae Yang that thing?</font>

91
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,425
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

92
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,925
<font color="yellow">That thing you always give to the grooms.</font>

93
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,195
<font color="yellow">That thing elders have in order to have some fun. The blue pill.</font>

94
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,625
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't need that.</font>

95
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,455
<font color="yellow">That's something you or Dong Jin would need.</font>

96
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:41,455
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

97
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,555
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

98
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:45,495
<font color="yellow">I thought I saw you put one in the car. You didn't give it to him?</font>

99
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:47,725
<font color="yellow">You must have taken it yourself.</font>

100
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:48,995
<font color="yellow">Stop the nonsense.</font>

101
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:53,255
<font color="yellow">They'll live happily, Ms Ko.</font>

102
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,955
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about them.</font>

103
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:57,555
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried we might have rushed things.</font>

104
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,225
<font color="yellow">If only our family hadn't gone bankrupt,</font>

105
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:02,025
<font color="yellow">we wouldn't have hurried things and held such a simple wedding.</font>

106
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,295
<font color="yellow">Don't cry, Mum.</font>

107
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,255
<font color="yellow">That's right. I almost forgot.</font>

108
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:10,125
<font color="yellow">Our father asked me to give you this.</font>

109
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,555
<font color="yellow">He sent this from Gangneung? He shouldn't have.</font>

110
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:21,295
<font color="yellow">Why check what's in the envelope while you say that?</font>

111
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,925
<font color="yellow">Thank you all for coming.</font>

112
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,025
<font color="yellow">All my relatives have turned their back on us...</font>

113
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,725
<font color="yellow">because they were worried we might ask them for money,</font>

114
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,825
<font color="yellow">but I can see I can rely on my friends and neighbours.</font>

115
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,895
<font color="yellow">By the way, where's Hyo Joo?</font>

116
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,895
<font color="yellow">She left in a hurry right after the ceremony.</font>

117
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,425
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dong Jin.</font>

118
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,795
<font color="yellow">When we were taking the group picture at the wedding earlier,</font>

119
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,925
<font color="yellow">I realised that we don't even have a decent wedding photo.</font>

120
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:44,125
<font color="yellow">All because of me, not only do we not have a decent picture,</font>

121
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,955
<font color="yellow">we weren't able to hold a proper ceremony. I'm sorry.</font>

122
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,995
<font color="yellow">Nonsense. That wasn't your fault.</font>

123
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,295
<font color="yellow">We made a promise with Samdo and Tae Pyung earlier, didn't we?</font>

124
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,795
<font color="yellow">Us three couples can hold an anniversary wedding someday.</font>

125
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,795
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Do you feel sick?</font>

126
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,995
<font color="yellow">The food was so good at the wedding.</font>

127
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:07,125
<font color="yellow">I must've have eaten too much. I think I have an upset stomach.</font>

128
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,195
<font color="yellow">Really? Shall we go to the hospital?</font>

129
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:14,055
<font color="yellow">No. It's not that serious. I'm sure time will ease the pain.</font>

130
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:17,095
<font color="yellow">Why don't you sit down. I'll try giving you a massage.</font>

131
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:36,955
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking beer in the daytime?</font>

132
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,395
<font color="yellow">Did the wedding ceremony go well?</font>

133
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:45,625
<font color="yellow">Of course, it went well.</font>

134
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:49,555
<font color="yellow">I think I know what's wrong. Our daughter is sad to see...</font>

135
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:52,555
<font color="yellow">her first love get married, so she must be having a drink.</font>

136
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:55,125
<font color="yellow">I just thought...</font>

137
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,125
<font color="yellow">I think I deserve to drink at least two cans of beer...</font>

138
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,395
<font color="yellow">on the day my love of two years gets married.</font>

139
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:02,795
<font color="yellow">This is a pitiful sight.</font>

140
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:04,955
<font color="yellow">I think it's a good idea.</font>

141
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,895
<font color="yellow">Have one can for each year you had a crush on him and forget him.</font>

142
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:11,355
<font color="yellow">If only he wasn't my in-law, I would've married him.</font>

143
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,125
<font color="yellow">Why say that when you act like you've gotten over him?</font>

144
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,825
<font color="yellow">Do you still have feelings for him?</font>

145
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,625
<font color="yellow">No. It's not that.</font>

146
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:23,725
<font color="yellow">I just feel a bit sad,</font>

147
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,055
<font color="yellow">and I feel ashamed of myself.</font>

148
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,595
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

149
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:33,455
<font color="yellow">Da Jeong. How should I put this? You see, a first love...</font>

150
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,255
<font color="yellow">is like a lottery ticket you haven't scratched.</font>

151
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,555
<font color="yellow">You know you have a low chance of winning the first prize,</font>

152
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,055

00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,325
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

305
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,125
<font color="yellow">Is that smoke?</font>

306
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,955
<font color="yellow">Smoke?</font>

307
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,395
<font color="yellow">Yes. There's smoke coming from under the hood.</font>

308
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,525
<font color="yellow">Honey, pull over.</font>

309
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,225
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

310
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:04,625
<font color="yellow">Yes. There's smoke coming from the engine.</font>

311
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,855
<font color="yellow">Okay, we'll wait.</font>

312
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:10,225
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

313
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,895
<font color="yellow">He said he'll come right now and wait.</font>

314
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:17,525
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't explode, would it?</font>

315
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,825
<font color="yellow">It won't, so don't worry.</font>

316
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,755
<font color="yellow">Will we make it to Busan today?</font>

317
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,855
<font color="yellow">He'll be here soon, so don't worry.</font>

318
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,755
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry and eat grilled fish.</font>

319
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:34,955
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

320
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:38,725
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

321
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,325
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

322
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,695
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go home?</font>

323
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:49,995
<font color="yellow">Where would I go?</font>

324
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:52,125
<font color="yellow">I waited until your class ended,</font>

325
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,795
<font color="yellow">like a student's parent.</font>

326
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:56,155
<font color="yellow">It's cold out and you must be tired.</font>

327
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,625
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to wait.</font>

328
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,155
<font color="yellow">It's dark out already.</font>

329
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,065
<font color="yellow">What if someone takes my pretty wife away?</font>

330
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,155
<font color="yellow">Who'd want an old woman like me?</font>

331
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:04,225
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

332
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,855
<font color="yellow">I saw your class earlier.</font>

333
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,955
<font color="yellow">You're the youngest and prettiest.</font>

334
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:09,925
<font color="yellow">Seriously. What nonsense.</font>

335
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:12,525
<font color="yellow">I was obviously the oldest there.</font>

336
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:17,425
<font color="yellow">It's tiring to study again, isn't it?</font>

337
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:20,025
<font color="yellow">I was so sleepy, I must've yawned like 10 times.</font>

338
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,755
<font color="yellow">You must be tired. Let's go home.</font>

339
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:23,955
<font color="yellow">Wait. I'm hungry.</font>

340
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,995
<font color="yellow">You felt sick earlier. Do you feel better?</font>

341
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:28,255
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

342
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:30,325
<font color="yellow">I want a steamed bun.</font>

343
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,155
<font color="yellow">- A steamed bun? - Yes. Steamed bun.</font>

344
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:33,725
<font color="yellow">That means we need a convenience store.</font>

345
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:35,995
<font color="yellow">A convenience store.</font>

346
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:37,925
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

347
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,325
<font color="yellow">I won't steal your food, so slow down.</font>

348
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:43,825
<font color="yellow">Here, have some milk.</font>

349
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:46,995
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Maybe it's because I haven't used my brain in a while.</font>

350
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:50,955
<font color="yellow">Is it that good?</font>

351
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,055
<font color="yellow">I don't usually like steamed buns,</font>

352
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,725
<font color="yellow">but it's really good today.</font>

353
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,925
<font color="yellow">Here. Have some.</font>

354
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:00,525
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Eat slowly.</font>

355
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,025
<font color="yellow">Drink some of this too.</font>

356
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:15,125
<font color="yellow">The CT and x-ray showed...</font>

357
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,525
<font color="yellow">- that her appendix is fine. - Good.</font>

358
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,225
<font color="yellow">You may take her home...</font>

359
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:20,895
<font color="yellow">after she finishes getting the fluids and painkiller.</font>

360
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:22,125
<font color="yellow">She doesn't need to be admitted?</font>

361
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,225
<font color="yellow">Even if she gets admitted, all we can do...</font>

362
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:25,525
<font color="yellow">is give her fluids anyway.</font>

363
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:28,125
<font color="yellow">She must've been under a lot of stress lately.</font>

364
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:31,225
<font color="yellow">She should rest and eat plenty of good food,</font>

365
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:32,495
<font color="yellow">- then she'll be fine. - Okay.</font>

366
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,425
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. You know you are anaemic, right?</font>

367
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:38,595
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Anaemic people...</font>

368
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,155
<font color="yellow">must be extra careful about eating right.</font>

369
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:43,225
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to take your vitamins and iron.</font>

370
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,825
<font color="yellow">- Okay, then. - Thank you.</font>

371
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:53,595
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

372
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:56,795
<font color="yellow">I should've been more attentive.</font>

373
00:22:58,695 --> 00:22:59,695
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

374
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:02,895
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't change so much so quickly.</font>

375
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,625
<font color="yellow">You rude brat.</font>

376
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:13,895
<font color="yellow">Hyo Joo.</font>

377
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,025
<font color="yellow">Let's...</font>

378
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,795
<font color="yellow">forget it all.</font>

379
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:24,925
<font color="yellow">You're sick...</font>

380
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,025
<font color="yellow">because of Dong Jin.</font>

381
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:31,125
<font color="yellow">You wanted to get him back somehow,</font>

382
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:33,325
<font color="yellow">but it wasn't going your way.</font>

383
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:36,525
<font color="yellow">That's why it was eating you up inside...</font>

384
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,155
<font color="yellow">until it destroyed your body.</font>

385
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,795
<font color="yellow">Looks like we'll be spending our first night together in a car.</font>

386
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,025
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

387
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,225
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have listened to my friend.</font>

388
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:58,125
<font color="yellow">I like it. It was thrilling and very special.</font>

389
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:00,255
<font color="yellow">Do you mean it?</font>

390
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,525
<font color="yellow">It's completely different from everyone else's first night.</font>

391
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:08,725
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget it for as long as I live.</font>

392
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:12,055
<font color="yellow">True. Even if we fight, if we think about tonight,</font>

393
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:14,725
<font color="yellow">it'll probably make us laugh.</font>

394
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,955
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

395
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,855
<font color="yellow">I'll make money and save up so that we can buy a house...</font>

396
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,225
<font color="yellow">and a car.</font>

397
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:23,825
<font color="yellow">I won't make you...</font>

398
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:25,495
<font color="yellow">suffer like tonight.</font>

399
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,425
<font color="yellow">I told you, I didn't suffer at all.</font>

400
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:28,825
<font color="yellow">It was a memory.</font>

401
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,025
<font color="yellow">It was a gift I will never forget.</font>

402
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:36,125

414
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:26,125
<font color="yellow">I took over when Meesa was in a dire situation.</font>

415
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:31,195
<font color="yellow">I did my best to convince creditors and stabilise our stock price.</font>

416
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:36,125
<font color="yellow">As a result, I finally but barely made the creditors agree...</font>

417
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,125
<font color="yellow">to not demand we repay them immediately.</font>

418
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:42,425
<font color="yellow">Our stock price has stabilised since the market realised...</font>

419
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:44,325
<font color="yellow">we won't go through a liquidity crisis.</font>

420
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,825
<font color="yellow">Our shareholders were dumping what they owned,</font>

421
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,595
<font color="yellow">but prices have risen by 50 percent.</font>

422
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:52,225
<font color="yellow">Although we haven't yet made a full recovery,</font>

423
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:54,925
<font color="yellow">once we release our performance of the first quarter,</font>

424
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,025
<font color="yellow">I believe our share prices will rise exponentially.</font>

425
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:04,755
<font color="yellow">I believe this was made possible by the shareholders,</font>

426
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:09,225
<font color="yellow">you and the hard work of all our employees.</font>

431
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:43,825
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was bedridden for a few days.</font>

432
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:47,455
<font color="yellow">I guess I was under a lot of stress.</font>

433
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,225
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

434
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:01,195
<font color="yellow">I heard that thanks to you, Meesa's back on track.</font>

435
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,625
<font color="yellow">I'm a bad judge of men, but a good judge of character.</font>

436
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,125
<font color="yellow">You're the best businessman.</font>

437
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,395
<font color="yellow">Were you very sick?</font>

438
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:15,525
<font color="yellow">It was nothing. A bout of love sickness.</font>

439
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:20,125
<font color="yellow">It was a joke. There's no need to tense up.</font>

440

<font color="yellow">Find a good guy.</font>

441
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:26,955
<font color="yellow">You're still very beautiful and full of charm.</font>

442
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:29,955
<font color="yellow">Thanks for saying that.</font>

443
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:33,025
<font color="yellow">I had such a great ex-husband...</font>

444
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:35,655
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if anyone can satisfy me.</font>

445
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,825
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

446
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:51,225
<font color="yellow">We got another order from the department store.</font>

447
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:54,455
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do all this if I had 10 clones.</font>

448
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:57,325
<font color="yellow">Don't we need another experienced worker?</font>

00:47:21,825 --> 00:47:24,025
<font color="yellow">Now I don't have to stay on your good side.</font>

767
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:26,155
<font color="yellow">Who cares if I nag or not?</font>

768
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:27,825
<font color="yellow">So nothing stops you?</font>

769
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:33,725
<font color="yellow">I'll call morning and evening and be an evil stepmother, so be prepared.</font>

770
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,825
<font color="yellow">Bye. Let's talk tomorrow.</font>

771
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:44,125
<font color="yellow">Did you just talk to Hyo Won?</font>

772
00:47:45,695 --> 00:47:47,255
<font color="yellow">No, Hyo Joo.</font>

773
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,225
<font color="yellow">That was Hyo Joo on the phone?</font>

774
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,425
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

775
00:47:52,025 --> 00:47:53,825
<font color="yellow">You sounded so sweet.</font>

776
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:56,355
<font color="yellow">You used to hate each other's guts.</font>

777
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:57,725
<font color="yellow">Why the sudden change?</font>

778
00:47:57,725 --> 00:48:00,325
<font color="yellow">Did you just say I hated her guts?</font>

779
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:02,955
<font color="yellow">How dare you say that to your mother-in-law!</font>

780
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:06,125
<font color="yellow">You're an anchor, aren't you?</font>

781
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,625
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what not to say?</font>

782
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:11,925
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

783
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:15,625
<font color="yellow">Why do you act like you hate Ji Yun's guts?</font>

784
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,895
<font color="yellow">I just can't stand this.</font>

785
00:48:18,325 --> 00:48:20,855
<font color="yellow">I should save up and move out of here.</font>

786
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:24,525
<font color="yellow">I can't stand living with my newly-wed son.</font>

787
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:26,725
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

788
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:31,325
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

789
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:34,355
<font color="yellow">I should just...</font>

790
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:36,755
<font color="yellow">My head aches.</font>

791
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,725
<font color="yellow">That's awesome.</font>

792
00:48:42,725 --> 00:48:45,855
<font color="yellow">How much is that if you included the credit card slips?</font>

793
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:50,995
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

794
00:48:52,995 --> 00:48:55,955
<font color="yellow">Hang in there. I'll buy you a building.</font>

795
00:48:56,325 --> 00:48:58,955
<font color="yellow">If you really want to make big money,</font>

796
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:01,725
<font color="yellow">you should run a business, not work for a pay.</font>

797
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:05,155
<font color="yellow">Was dinner too salty? I feel thirsty.</font>

798
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:18,555
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

799
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:25,655
<font color="yellow">Freeze.</font>

800
00:49:32,225 --> 00:49:33,225
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?</font>

801
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:35,555
<font color="yellow">These two bills were sticking out and I was...</font>

802
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,125
<font color="yellow">going to put them back.</font>

803
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:41,525
<font color="yellow">You look so normal and you steal from your wife?</font>

804
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:44,725
<font color="yellow">The older you get the sillier you become.</font>

805
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:48,825
<font color="yellow">How dare you say that to your respectable husband.</font>

806
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:50,325
<font color="yellow">Respectable husband?</font>

807
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,225
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

808
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,355
<font color="yellow">Massage my stomach and I'll give you 20 dollars.</font>

809
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,625
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

810
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:06,855
<font color="yellow">Why do you need a massage?</font>

811
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:08,825
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

812
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:12,795
<font color="yellow">I've been feeling weird after meals for a while.</font>

813
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:15,755
<font color="yellow">I feel nauseous and just generally not too good.</font>

814
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:18,955
<font color="yellow">You got worried about the new store and got stressed...</font>

815
00:50:18,955 --> 00:50:21,925
<font color="yellow">about meeting the oil lady, that's why.</font>

816
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:22,925
<font color="yellow">Do you want some medicine?</font>

817
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:25,655
<font color="yellow">No, I'll be fine after a good rest.</font>

818
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:27,655
<font color="yellow">Give me a massage.</font>

819
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:30,325
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a great one if you pay me in advance.</font>

820
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:33,325
<font color="yellow">You love money too much.</font>

821
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:34,755
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

822
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:35,855
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

823
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:41,995
<font color="yellow">Get well, get well soon.</font>

824
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:44,355
<font color="yellow">Get well, Sun Nyeo.</font>

825
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:47,595
<font color="yellow">That is gross. How could you?</font>

826
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:50,955
<font color="yellow">You have a great touch.</font>

827
00:50:50,955 --> 00:50:53,725
<font color="yellow">I feel so much better already.</font>

828
00:50:54,525 --> 00:50:55,595
<font color="yellow">Keep going.</font>

829
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:59,555
<font color="yellow">Get well, get well soon.</font>

830
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:02,555
<font color="yellow">Get well, Sun Nyeo.</font>

831
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:03,755
<font color="yellow">That's lovely.</font>

832
00:51:11,325 --> 00:51:13,355
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, are you busy?</font>

833
00:51:13,355 --> 00:51:16,095
<font color="yellow">No. Do you need help with something?</font>

834
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:22,625
<font color="yellow">I just can't understand what this means.</font>

835
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:25,625
<font color="yellow">Let me see. It's a quadratic inequality.</font>

836
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:27,825
<font color="yellow">What do you not get?</font>

837
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:29,825
<font color="yellow">The answer says...</font>

838
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:31,625
<font color="yellow">"X" has a real positive value.</font>

839
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,255
<font color="yellow">Why must I start with zero?</font>

840
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:34,855
<font color="yellow">Can't I start with one?</font>

841
00:51:34,855 --> 00:51:37,155
<font color="yellow">A number with a real positive value...</font>

842
00:51:37,155 --> 00:51:38,495
<font color="yellow">is larger than 0, not 1.</font>

843
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:41,855
<font color="yellow">Using the formula in the answer sheet,</font>

844
00:51:41,855 --> 00:51:44,455
<font color="yellow">start by putting zero instead of "X".</font>

845
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:47,125
<font color="yellow">The answer is whichever results in "A" being equal to...</font>

846
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,495
<font color="yellow">or larger than zero.</font>

847
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:53,225
<font color="yellow">When "X" is larger than zero...</font>

848
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:56,025
<font color="yellow">"A" has to have a real positive value.</font>

849
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:58,225
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

850
00:51:58,225 --> 00:52:00,255
<font color="yellow">The line on the graph goes up...</font>

851
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:02,255
<font color="yellow">when "X" is larger than -2.</font>

852
00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:05,325
<font color="yellow">I still don't get it.</font>

853
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:09,855
<font color="yellow">You can't look at the answer whenever you get stuck.</font>

854
00:52:09,955 --> 00:52:12,595
<font color="yellow">You have to try to solve and understand it yourself.</font>

855
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:15,555
<font color="yellow">You'll never get there if you use the answers.</font>

856
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:18,225
<font color="yellow">Should I struggle with a question...</font>

857
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:20,355
<font color="yellow">I've been stuck on for hours?</font>

858
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:23,055
<font color="yellow">When learning how to sew, you look at...</font>

859
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:25,525
<font color="yellow">a good example and copy what you see.</font>

860
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:28,525
<font color="yellow">I need to look at the answer sheet to know...</font>

861
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:29,995
<font color="yellow">how to solve maths problems.</font>

862
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:33,025
<font color="yellow">You can't compare maths to sewing.</font>

863
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:36,095
<font color="yellow">Why not? Learning the steps to solving a maths problem...</font>

864
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:39,595
<font color="yellow">is just like learning how to sew stitch by stitch.</font>

865
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:42,055
<font color="yellow">You're pushing it.</font>

866
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,225
<font color="yellow">- You're unbelievable. - I'm what?</font>

867
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:47,255
<font color="yellow">Did you mean me?</font>

868
00:52:47,255 --> 00:52:48,925
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

869
00:52:48,925 --> 00:52:50,955
<font color="yellow">What's wrong now?</font>

870
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:53,425
<font color="yellow">I'm just trying to teach you,</font>

871
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:56,655
<font color="yellow">and I just said you shouldn't rely on the answers.</font>

872
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:58,755
<font color="yellow">I just can't do it by myself...</font>

873
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:01,225
<font color="yellow">and was going to refer it for hints.</font>

874
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:03,325
<font color="yellow">You made me feel bad.</font>

875
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,095
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to make you feel bad.</font>

876
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:09,995
<font color="yellow">Maths isn't about getting the answer right away.</font>

877
00:53:09,995 --> 00:53:12,025
<font color="yellow">You learn by solving problems.</font>

878
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:16,055
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You show off just because you can solve a maths problem.</font>

879
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:21,755
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

880
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:25,095
<font color="yellow">Is she upset that I tried to teach her?</font>

881
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:42,225
<font color="yellow">I asked because I got stuck and he did nothing but nag.</font>

882
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:48,425
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel hungry already?</font>

883
00:53:58,225 --> 00:54:00,125
<font color="yellow">- Yun Shil. - It's still good cold.</font>

884
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,595
<font color="yellow">Are you upset...</font>

885
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:05,455
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

886
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:08,925
<font color="yellow">There's no point in hiding it.</font>

887
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:15,325
<font color="yellow">You're eating so soon after getting angry with me?</font>

888
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:17,825
<font color="yellow">I need eat and gain the energy...</font>

889
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:19,425
<font color="yellow">if I'm to fight you.</font>

890
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,125
<font color="yellow">I don't believe this.</font>

891
00:54:30,255 --> 00:54:31,695
<font color="yellow">Are you sick, Yun Shil?</font>

892
00:54:31,695 --> 00:54:33,755
<font color="yellow">What? No.</font>

893
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:36,425
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking at your food?</font>

894
00:54:36,425 --> 00:54:39,425
<font color="yellow">I was just a bit distracted. I'll get back to eating now.</font>

895
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:45,225
<font color="yellow">Are you not feeling well?</font>

896
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:47,725
<font color="yellow">I still have an upset stomach.</font>

897
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:51,695
<font color="yellow">Have some meat. It's nicely cooked.</font>

898
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,825
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling sick as well?</font>

899
00:54:57,925 --> 00:55:01,055
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry. I suddenly felt nauseated.</font>

900
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:07,725
<font color="yellow">Hang on. Do you think you could be pregnant?</font>

901
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:10,655
<font color="yellow">You could be. Morning sickness is usually a sign.</font>

902
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,655
<font color="yellow">Is that what it is?</font>

903
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:16,525
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. I don't really know.</font>

904
00:55:16,595 --> 00:55:19,325
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, take her to see a doctor.</font>

905
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:22,325
<font color="yellow">Let's go right after breakfast.</font>

906
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:24,925
<font color="yellow">If you are pregnant,</font>

907
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:27,425
<font color="yellow">Mum and Dad will be really pleased.</font>

908
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:31,095
<font color="yellow">I doubt I'm pregnant. I'm not. I can't be.</font>

909
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:33,495
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

910
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:35,155
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

911
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:38,995
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Don't copy things like that.</font>

912
00:55:39,495 --> 00:55:42,695
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it on purpose. I suddenly felt nauseated myself.</font>

913
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,555
<font color="yellow">I told you to take some medicine before going to sleep last night.</font>

914
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:52,495
<font color="yellow">It's not indigestion or anything. I feel nauseated.</font>

915
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,525
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing.</font>

916
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:59,655
<font color="yellow">I think Sun Nyeo's jealous that Yun Shil could be pregnant.</font>

917
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,795
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Eat up.</font>

924
00:56:30,295 --> 00:56:32,625

<font color="yellow">The doctor said you need to be careful...</font>

932
00:56:53,655 --> 00:56:54,955
<font color="yellow">because it is still very early.</font>

950
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:37,695

951
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:39,955
<font color="yellow">Wait. I'm still very early in my pregnancy.</font>

952
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:41,255
<font color="yellow">Let's not tell anyone yet.</font>

953
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:43,525
<font color="yellow">We can let them know once I'm stable.</font>

954
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:45,295
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

955

959
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:55,155

960
00:57:57,595 --> 00:57:59,655
<font color="yellow">Looks like we have a foetus name already.</font>

961
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:01,855
<font color="yellow">- Let's call it "Steamed Bun". - Steamed Bun?</font>

962

970

<font color="yellow">I'm taking a walk...</font>

971

<font color="yellow">a grandpa once more.</font>

982
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:09,495
<font color="yellow">Are you saying Yun Shil is pregnant?</font>

983
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:13,425
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Dad. - Goodness. Congratulations.</font>

984
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:16,555
<font color="yellow">Your mum will be very happy to hear that. Congratulations.</font>

00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,795
<font color="yellow">Okay. We'll come down soon.</font>

989
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,755
<font color="yellow">She needs to take care of herself during the early stage.</font>

990
00:59:29,325 --> 00:59:31,495
<font color="yellow">You have to help her out a lot.</font>

991
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,695

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

994
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:53,225
<font color="yellow">but when I had you and your sister,</font>

995
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:56,095
<font color="yellow">I wasn't completely thrilled as you are now.</font>

996

997

<font color="yellow">but at the same time,</font>

998
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:05,595

1017
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:58,525
