157
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:52,271
<font color="yellow">Isn't she going to quit her job after the marriage?</font>

158
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,371
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Mum.</font>

159
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,371
<font color="yellow">How can you say such an old-fashioned thing?</font>

160
00:10:58,101 --> 00:10:59,201
<font color="yellow">I'm not quitting my job, Mother.</font>

161
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:02,241
<font color="yellow">My dream is to become Oprah Winfrey of Korea.</font>

162
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,141
<font color="yellow">- Who's that? - My goodness, Mum.</font>

163
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,871
<font color="yellow">She is a famous African-American...</font>

164
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,871
<font color="yellow">female talk-show host in America.</font>

165
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,801
<font color="yellow">- Oprah has curly hair. - Has she?</font>

166
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,441
<font color="yellow">Well, I know her.</font>

167
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,471
<font color="yellow">- Right. - Well,</font>

168
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:18,541
<font color="yellow">you have such an over-sized ambition.</font>

169
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:23,041
<font color="yellow">I'm confident I can do well at both ends, home and work.</font>

170
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,771
<font color="yellow">Please give us your permission, Mum.</font>

171
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,871
<font color="yellow">She should learn our family customs...</font>

172
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,501
<font color="yellow">and get lessons for married life.</font>

173
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,271
<font color="yellow">She has a lot to do. I say no.</font>

174
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,141
<font color="yellow">If you hurry too much, something bad may happen.</font>

175
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:50,801
<font color="yellow">What shall we do?</font>

176
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:52,771
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

177
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,371
<font color="yellow">I have an idea.</font>

178
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,241
<font color="yellow">Ji Yun is too ambitious.</font>

179
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,841
<font color="yellow">Tae Yang is too humble.</font>

180
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:16,501
<font color="yellow">I wish they could be switched.</font>

181
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:18,701
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

182
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,671
<font color="yellow">what is Hyo Won doing with Kang Tae Yang without me?</font>

183
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:51,041
<font color="yellow">Why is she calling? She's disturbing Tae Yang.</font>

184
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:57,001
<font color="yellow">You must be tired. Get some more sleep.</font>

185
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,201
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I was not sleeping.</font>

186
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,371
<font color="yellow">I was watching you studying.</font>

187
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,001
<font color="yellow">What is the mark around your mouth, then?</font>

188
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:05,201
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

189
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,801
<font color="yellow">Just kidding.</font>

190
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,441
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

191
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,301
<font color="yellow">How is it going with your study?</font>

192
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:17,201
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

193
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:18,701
<font color="yellow">so-so.</font>

194
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:21,941
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can do better if I kiss you?</font>

195
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,371
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

196
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,801
<font color="yellow">Don't be shy.</font>

197
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:31,071
<font color="yellow">I'll give my energy to you.</font>

198
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,841
<font color="yellow">We're not supposed to do that.</font>

199
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:46,771
<font color="yellow">That would distract me. I can't concentrate.</font>

200
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:50,001
<font color="yellow">Why would it distract you?</font>

201
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,801
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Let's get some fresh air outside.</font>

202
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,071
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

203
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,271
<font color="yellow">- Please carry me on your back. - What?</font>

204
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,101
<font color="yellow">Carry me to the hallway.</font>

205
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:09,801
<font color="yellow">I'll be kicked out for demoralization.</font>

206
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,101
<font color="yellow">It's a violation to be with you here.</font>

207
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,741
<font color="yellow">Which is more important to you, me or the rules?</font>

208
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,341
<font color="yellow">Don't say that way.</font>

209
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,041
<font color="yellow">You seem to consider the rules more than me.</font>

210
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,701
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

211
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,871
<font color="yellow">Then carry me on your back now.</font>

212
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,301
<font color="yellow">My legs are numb that I can't walk.</font>

213
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,641
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

214
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:49,871
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

215
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:58,101
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

216
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:02,741
<font color="yellow">My phone. Got it.</font>

217
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,241
<font color="yellow">Okay? Let's go.</font>

218
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,301
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

219
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:17,301
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Go, go.</font>

220
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,341
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

221
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:32,341
<font color="yellow">We'll gather the tailors scattered all over Korea...</font>

222
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:34,301
<font color="yellow">and create a guild.</font>

223
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,201
<font color="yellow">- A guild? - Yes.</font>

224
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:41,071
<font color="yellow">People don't order tailored suits,</font>

225
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:44,601
<font color="yellow">so talented tailors turned to dry-cleaning or making alterations.</font>

226
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,341
<font color="yellow">Some even changed jobs altogether.</font>

227
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,401
<font color="yellow">I thought it's pity to waste such talent,</font>

228
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:53,271
<font color="yellow">so if we can give them a chance to work again,</font>

229
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:57,201
<font color="yellow">it would be great for us and for the industry.</font>

230
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:01,201
<font color="yellow">You seem like someone from a different world.</font>

231
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,071
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

232
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,801
<font color="yellow">I started to wonder if...</font>

233
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,571
<font color="yellow">I'm being too greedy.</font>

234
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,171
<font color="yellow">If I can handle someone...</font>

235
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,371
<font color="yellow">as great as you.</font>

236
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,301
<font color="yellow">Things like that.</font>

237
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:19,241
<font color="yellow">You tend to think too highly of me.</font>

238
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,641
<font color="yellow">I'm not that great.</font>

239
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:24,201
<font color="yellow">Don't overestimate me. It's stressful.</font>

240
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,971
<font color="yellow">You are not laugh at my joke.</font>

241
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:33,801
<font color="yellow">You're a bit odd today. Is something wrong?</font>

242
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,401
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

243
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,601
<font color="yellow">I'm just tired and overworked.</font>

244
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,341
<font color="yellow">Shall I massage you?</font>

245
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:41,701
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

246
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,001
<font color="yellow">Turn around. I'll make you feel much better.</font>

247
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,601
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you're massaging me.</font>

248
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:52,201
<font color="yellow">What did I do to deserve this?</font>

249
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:56,371
<font color="yellow">My parents will accept us soon.</font>

250
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:59,701
<font color="yellow">You've known my mum for years.</font>

251
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,541
<font color="yellow">She can't stand me being sad.</font>

252
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,311
<font color="yellow">You make me feel warm.</font>

253
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,541
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

254
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,001
<font color="yellow">My dear brother-in-law.</font>

255
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,771
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law?</font>

256
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,171
<font color="yellow">She must be her sister.</font>

257
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,871
<font color="yellow">I missed you so, so much.</font>

258
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,701
<font color="yellow">I missed you so much...</font>

259
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,311
<font color="yellow">but I didn't dare call you.</font>

260
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:11,741
<font color="yellow">I thought of you a lot, too.</font>

261
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,871
<font color="yellow">How do you know Hyo Won?</font>

262
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:19,171
<font color="yellow">I meant to tell you, but I was too embarrassed to.</font>

263
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,701
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

264
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,341
<font color="yellow">Do you know my Tae Yang?</font>

265
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,641
<font color="yellow">"My Tae Yang"?</font>

266
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:30,401
<font color="yellow">She's my girlfriend.</font>

267
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,871
<font color="yellow">- Your girlfriend? - Your girlfriend?</font>

268
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,371
<font color="yellow">I've been hitting on him for ages...</font>

269
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,201
<font color="yellow">and he finally gave in.</font>

270
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,741
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

271
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,941
<font color="yellow">She's Dong Jin's girlfriend.</font>

272
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,541
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

273
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:16,171
<font color="yellow">What a small world.</font>

274
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,741
<font color="yellow">I had no idea you two would end up together.</font>

275
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:22,471
<font color="yellow">I still think it's a dream sometimes.</font>

276
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:28,741
<font color="yellow">Have you two known each other for long?</font>

277
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,601
<font color="yellow">We met when I started working at the tailor shop.</font>

278
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:36,141
<font color="yellow">We haven't been dating for long.</font>

279
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,041
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

280
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,771
<font color="yellow">You should eat. You like chicken.</font>

281
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,271
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Thanks.</font>

282
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,201
<font color="yellow">You like chicken, too.</font>

283
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,841
<font color="yellow">Feed me.</font>

284
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:40,241
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the ladies' room.</font>

285
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,601
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

286
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,041
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

287
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:58,101
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd start dating so soon.</font>

288
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,001
<font color="yellow">It just happened.</font>

289
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:04,141
<font color="yellow">My sister isn't over you yet.</font>

290
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:08,271
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to get back with her?</font>

291
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,471
<font color="yellow">I don't at all.</font>

292
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:15,201
<font color="yellow">My mum says Hyo Joo regrets what she did.</font>

293
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:18,201
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past. There's no going back.</font>

294
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,871
<font color="yellow">Your sister will meet someone worthy of her.</font>

295
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:29,001
<font color="yellow">What do you like about her?</font>

296
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:34,271
<font color="yellow">She's sweet and warmhearted.</font>

297
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:36,401
<font color="yellow">And pretty as well.</font>

298
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,501
<font color="yellow">It was good to see you.</font>

299
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:50,301
<font color="yellow">Be nice to Hyo Won.</font>

300
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:51,501
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

301
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,871
<font color="yellow">Call me if he ever upsets you.</font>

302
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,241
<font color="yellow">I'll teach him a lesson.</font>

303
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:56,601
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

304
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:01,271
<font color="yellow">This is a lot of pressure.</font>

305
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:04,371
<font color="yellow">Let's meet up another time. Bye for now.</font>

306
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:07,641
<font color="yellow">You two live in the same house, so you'll head off together.</font>

307
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,241
<font color="yellow">We'll go ahead first.</font>

308
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,671
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

309
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:13,541
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you live in the same house?</font>

310
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,771
<font color="yellow">Did you move in together already?</font>

311
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:18,771
<font color="yellow">Now, now.</font>

312
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,301
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

313
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:23,801
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin, this is too soon. You only just started dating.</font>

314
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,801
<font color="yellow">Are you two living together already? Like a married couple?</font>

315
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:28,841
<font color="yellow">Dong Jin.</font>

316
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:30,601
<font color="yellow">Let me go, Tae Yang.</font>

317
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,541
<font color="yellow">I need an answer. Dong Jin!</font>

318
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:36,871
<font color="yellow">We should go, too.</font>

319
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:38,371
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

320
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:41,041
<font color="yellow">Did you feel uncomfortable around Hyo Won?</font>

321
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,801
<font color="yellow">No. She's cheerful and honest.</font>

322
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:45,741
<font color="yellow">She put me in a good mood.</font>

323
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:46,871
<font color="yellow">She does that.</font>

324
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:52,841
<font color="yellow">I'm glad and relieved that Tae Yang found himself...</font>

325
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,401
<font color="yellow">such a cheerful and bright girlfriend.</font>

326
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:57,871
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

327
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:09,001
<font color="yellow">He should be home by now.</font>

328
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,641
<font color="yellow">Why hasn't he called yet?</font>

329
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,371
<font color="yellow">Is he with his first love?</font>

330
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,401
<font color="yellow">The phone has been turned off. Please leave a message.</font>

331
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:28,041
<font color="yellow">What, he turned his phone off?</font>

332
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,801
<font color="yellow">What is he up to?</font>

333
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:40,641
<font color="yellow">- Sam Do. - Will you...</font>

334
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:42,271
<font color="yellow">leave with me?</font>

335
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,401
<font color="yellow">Where will we go?</font>

336
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,471
<font color="yellow">I will go wherever my wife isn't.</font>

337
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:51,101
<font color="yellow">Can you really leave everything behind?</font>

338
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:53,271
<font color="yellow">My life wasn't worth living until now.</font>

339
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:55,541
<font color="yellow">Every day was worse than torture.</font>

340
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,341
<font color="yellow">My wife picks a fight with me or someone else every day...</font>

341
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,271
<font color="yellow">and we never got along.</font>

342
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:03,201
<font color="yellow">I only lived because I could not die.</font>

343
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:05,741
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry for you.</font>

344
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:07,101
<font color="yellow">I will be honest.</font>

345
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:10,501
<font color="yellow">My body was with my wife...</font>

346
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,001
<font color="yellow">but my heart was always with you.</font>

347
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:19,441
<font color="yellow">When I saw you again...</font>

348
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,401
<font color="yellow">I realised the lord was giving me a second chance.</font>

349
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:25,201
<font color="yellow">Even if I must risk my life,</font>

350
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:29,641
<font color="yellow">I swore to myself that I would not let this opportunity go.</font>

351
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:34,001
<font color="yellow">If your wife finds out...</font>

352
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:36,201
<font color="yellow">she will throw a fit.</font>

353
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:39,141
<font color="yellow">If it's to spend just one day with you,</font>

354
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:43,701
<font color="yellow">then I will have no regrets even if my wife beats me to death.</font>

355
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:50,701
<font color="yellow">I am Bae Sam Do.</font>

356
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:54,371
<font color="yellow">I am blinded and I fear nothing.</font>

357
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:13,741
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

358
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,971
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

359
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:17,741
<font color="yellow">Over my dead body.</font>

360
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,271
<font color="yellow">I won't let them elope.</font>

361
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:34,201
<font color="yellow">This is my new song.</font>

362
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:35,671
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you think.</font>

363
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,441
<font color="yellow">How long has it been since your last new song?</font>

364
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:42,671
<font color="yellow">I'm so moved I want to cry.</font>

365
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,401
<font color="yellow">This song...</font>

366
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,941
<font color="yellow">portrays the love I have for you.</font>

367
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:49,801
<font color="yellow">That's so romantic.</font>

368
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,041
<font color="yellow">It's titled "My Brother Goes".</font>

369
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,701
<font color="yellow">- That means me. - You?</font>

370
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:58,601
<font color="yellow">I love the title.</font>

371
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:07,071
<font color="yellow">My brother goes, goes, goes</font>

372
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:11,501
<font color="yellow">He goes at full speed</font>

373
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:16,071
<font color="yellow">My brother goes, goes, goes</font>

374
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:21,671
<font color="yellow">He is coming to me</font>

375
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:27,941
<font color="yellow">Dong Sook.</font>

376
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:31,841
<font color="yellow">Do you smell something burning?</font>

377
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,441
<font color="yellow">It's coming from the kitchen.</font>

378
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:40,971
<font color="yellow">Something's burning.</font>

379
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:46,471
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

380
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,241
<font color="yellow">Don't, you'll burn your hands.</font>

381
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:49,541
<font color="yellow">Let it cool.</font>

382
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:53,771
<font color="yellow">She left in a hurry while cooking dinner.</font>

383
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:55,671
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

384
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,141
<font color="yellow">She even left her phone.</font>

385
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,371
<font color="yellow">What has gotten into her?</font>

386
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:13,141
<font color="yellow">She's been really distracted recently.</font>

387
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:14,401
<font color="yellow">Is Sam Do in trouble?</font>

388
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:34,501
<font color="yellow">What is she doing here?</font>

389
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,541
<font color="yellow">- You're called Seung Woo? - Yes.</font>

390
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,871
<font color="yellow">Did you see a middle-aged man today?</font>

391
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,271
<font color="yellow">What does he look like?</font>

392
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,601
<font color="yellow">He's handsome and very muscly.</font>

393
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:49,271
<font color="yellow">He makes suits.</font>

394
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,741
<font color="yellow">He wasn't here today, then.</font>

395
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,471
<font color="yellow">- I'll take two packs of castella. - Okay.</font>

396
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:09,301
<font color="yellow">My husband loves castella.</font>

397
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,741
<font color="yellow">Where is your husband?</font>

398
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,371
<font color="yellow">Is he still at work?</font>

399
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:17,201
<font color="yellow">I don't like to talk about my private life.</font>

400
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,041
<font color="yellow">It looks like she lives alone with her son.</font>

401
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:27,471
<font color="yellow">Is she divorced?</font>

402
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:32,571
<font color="yellow">Did she move here to lure Sam Do?</font>

403
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:55,301
<font color="yellow">(Oh Young Eun Bakery)</font>

404
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,301
<font color="yellow">- Seung Woo. - Mr Tailor.</font>

405
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,001
<font color="yellow">How are you today?</font>

406
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,271
<font color="yellow">- Were you studying? - Yes.</font>

407
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:10,571
<font color="yellow">Good. High-five.</font>

408
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:12,701
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

409
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:17,571
<font color="yellow">I just met friends from the orphanage.</font>

410
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:19,441
<font color="yellow">They expected to see you...</font>

411
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,371
<font color="yellow">and were so disappointed.</font>

412
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:25,301
<font color="yellow">I needed to watch the store and Seung Woo.</font>

413
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:28,371
<font color="yellow">- Are they all well? - Yes, they are.</font>

414
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:29,871
<font color="yellow">Sam Do.</font>

415
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,201
<font color="yellow">Can you do me a favour?</font>

416
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,401
<font color="yellow">I want to meet your wife.</font>

417
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,771
<font color="yellow">- My wife? - Yes.</font>

418
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,641
<font color="yellow">We should say hi now that we're neighbours.</font>

419
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,501
<font color="yellow">Your wife...</font>

420
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:46,271
<font color="yellow">would be like a sister to me.</font>

421
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:49,001
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

422
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,471
<font color="yellow">That's true,</font>

423
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:52,741
<font color="yellow">but my wife is very...</font>

424
00:29:58,141 --> 00:29:59,571
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll talk to her.</font>

425
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,171
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

426
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,441
<font color="yellow">What is Yun Shil like?</font>

427
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,841
<font color="yellow">She's very nice and sweet.</font>

428
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,941
<font color="yellow">It could be a facade.</font>

429
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:15,001
<font color="yellow">We grew up together. She's practically my sister.</font>

430
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,301
<font color="yellow">What you see is what you get.</font>

431
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,071
<font color="yellow">She and Dong Jin can't be together.</font>

432
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,271
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

433
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,671
<font color="yellow">My sister isn't over Dong Jin yet.</font>

434
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:28,801
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

435
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:31,271
<font color="yellow">My Yun Shil's the one for Dong Jin.</font>

436
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,471
<font color="yellow">"My Yun Shil"?</font>

437
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:38,541
<font color="yellow">I told you that we're practically brother and sister.</font>

438
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:39,701
<font color="yellow">Even so,</font>

439
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:42,841
<font color="yellow">how could you take her side instead of mine on this issue?</font>

440
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,741
<font color="yellow">There are no sides.</font>

441
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:45,771
<font color="yellow">There are.</font>

442
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,401
<font color="yellow">I'm always on your side.</font>

443
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:50,971
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

444
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:54,441
<font color="yellow">If Yun Shil and I were drowning, who would you save first?</font>

445
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,101
<font color="yellow">That's such a stupid question.</font>

446
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,541
<font color="yellow">You're refusing to answer.</font>

447
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:03,141
<font color="yellow">Will you save Yun Shil first?</font>

448
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:07,271
<font color="yellow">Let me think about it.</font>

449
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:09,571
<font color="yellow">You need to think?</font>

450
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:17,801
<font color="yellow">I guess I should save you first.</font>

451
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,071
<font color="yellow">Will that do?</font>

452
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,671
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

453
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:24,171
<font color="yellow">It sounded so forced and insincere.</font>

454
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,171
<font color="yellow">I was kidding.</font>

455
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,241
<font color="yellow">How could you? You're so mean.</font>

456
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,771
<font color="yellow">You should have said me right away.</font>

457
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:34,601
<font color="yellow">How could you even hesitate?</font>

458
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:38,001
<font color="yellow">- I said I was kidding. - You weren't. You meant it.</font>

459
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,171
<font color="yellow">You don't love me truly.</font>

460
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:45,871
<font color="yellow">I kept hitting on you...</font>

461
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:48,201
<font color="yellow">and hassled you into giving in.</font>

462
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:50,541
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

463
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:52,541
<font color="yellow">I fell for it!</font>

464
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,271
<font color="yellow">I won't kiss you tonight!</font>

465
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,841
<font color="yellow">Hyo Won, that's not fair.</font>

466
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:05,841
